       "[' There may be killer asteroids headed for Earth, and NASA has decided to do something about it. The space agency announced a new \"Grand Challenge\" on June 18 to find all dangerous space rocks and figure out how to stop them from destroying our planet. The new mission builds on projects already underway at NASA, including a plan to capture an asteroid, pull it in toward the moon and send astronauts to visit it. As part of the Grand Challenge, the agency issued a \"request for information\" today — aiming to solicit ideas from industry, academia and the public on how to improve the asteroid mission plan. \"We\\'re asking for you to think about concepts and different approaches for what we\\'ve described here,\" William Gerstenmaier, NASA\\'s associate administrator for human explorations and operations, said yesterday during a NASA event announcing the initiative. \"We want you to think about other ways of enhancing this to get the most out of it.\" SEE ALSO: How It Works: NASA Asteroid-CaptureResponses to the request for information, which also seeks ideas for detecting and mitigating asteroid threats, are due July 18.The asteroid-retrieval mission, designed to provide the first deep-space mission for astronauts flying on NASA\\'s Space Launch System rocket and Orion space capsule under development, has come under fire from lawmakers who would prefer that NASA return to the moon.A draft NASA authorization bill from the House space subcommittee, which is currently in debate, would cancel the mission and steer the agency toward other projects. That bill will be discussed during a hearing Wednesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. EDT.SEE ALSO: How It Works: NASA Asteroid-Capture Mission in PicturesBut NASA officials defended the asteroid mission today and said they were confident they\\'d win Congress\\' support once they explained its benefits further.\"I think that we really, truly are going to be able to show the value of the mission,\" NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver said today. \"To me, this is something that what we do in this country — we debate how we spend the public\\'s money. This is the beginning of the debate.\"Garver also maintained that sending astronauts to an asteroid would not diminish NASA\\'s other science and exploration goals, including another lunar landing.SEE ALSO: Animation Of Proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission\"This initiative takes nothing from the other valuable work,\" she said. \"This is only a small piece of our overall strategy, but it is an integral piece. It takes nothing from the moon.\"Part of NASA\\'s plan to win support for the flight is to link it more closely with the larger goal of protecting Earth from asteroid threats.If, someday, humanity discovers an asteroid headed for Earth and manages to alter its course, \"it will be one of the most important accomplishments in human history,\" said Tom Kalil, deputy director for technology and innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.SEE ALSO: Wildest Private Deep-Space Mission Ideas: A CountdownThe topic of asteroid threats is more timely than ever, after a meteor exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15 — the same day that the football field-sized asteroid 2012 DA14 passed within the moon\\'s orbit of Earth.Image courtesy of NASA  SpaceX\\'s Musk Says Sabotage Unlikely Cause of Sept. 1 Explosion, But Still a Worry Proxima Centauri Is Like Our Sun... on Steroids China Launches Shenzhou-11 Astronauts to Tiangong-2 Space Lab Space Station Mockup In Houston - Astronaut Guided Tour | Video   This article originally published at Space.com here  ',\n",
       " ' Google took a stand of sorts against patent-lawsuit theater Thursday with its new Open Patent Non-Assertion (OPN) Pledge.  As explained by Google\\'s Duane Valz, under the OPN Pledge, Google promises \"not to sue any user, distributor or developer of open-source software on specified patents, unless first attacked.\" Now, Google isn\\'t making all of its patents available for others. Instead, its starting small with 10 patents focused on MapReduce, a programming model for handling large data sets. There are already open-sourced versions of MapReduce available — including Hadoop — that are widely used across the Internet. Google says that over time, it plans to extend the OPN Pledge to more Google patents. SEE ALSO: 10 Interesting Google Glass Winners and Their Wacky Ideas  The big caveat here is that Google is pledging not to sue anyone who uses its MapReduce patents for Free or Open Source Software. Google is defining Free or Open Source software as any software that meets the Open Source Initiative\\'s \"Open Source Definition,\" as well as any version of the Free Software Foundation\\'s \"Free Software Definition.\" Still, Google iterates that the OPN Pledge isn\\'t limited to a specific project or open-source copyright — as long as the project meets the FSF or OSI\\'s definition for Free Software or Open Source Software, it\\'s protected by the OPN Pledge. Google hopes that its OPN Pledge can be a model for other companies who are looking at how to \"put their own patents into the service of open-source software.\" In the short-term, we\\'re not sure what this does — except indemnify the open source MapReduce projects from a Google lawsuit. The bigger picture, however, is that this could be a new model for the way that patents are applied to open source as a whole. And that\\'s a good thing.

       " ' You\\'ve spend countless hours training to be an American football machine and all the blood, sweat and tears are about to pay off with a top selection in the NFL Draft — and its accompanying hefty contract.\\xa0All you need now is the perfect soundtrack for the prefect moment. This year, for the first time ever, 30 picks in the NFL Draft will get to choose their own walk-out music to blare at Radio City Music Hall while they take the stage, don the hat of their new team and shake hands with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. See also: Emotional MVP Speech Will Make Kevin Durant Your Favorite NBA Player NFL Network and ESPN will play natural sounds as picks take the stage, but in the background you should be able to hear the player-selected tracks (radio-versions only, of course) that Jadeveon Clowney, Johnny Manziel and others hand select. Thirty players the NFL invited to New York City for the draft will get to play DJ and pick their tracks. The 2014 NFL Draft\\'s first round is on Thursday. Brian McCarthy, the NFL\\'s vice president of communications, says the new move came about after soliciting feedback from players at previous drafts on how to make the the big day more fun. \"We’ve always had music for each player selected but it’s been more city-oriented,\" McCarthy told Mashable in an email. \"We ask the prospects we have in NYC each year for ways to improve their overall experience.\" So the question becomes: Do you go with \"C.R.E.A.M.\" from the Wu-Tang Clan? Or what about \"All I Do Is Win\" from DJ Khaled? Then again, maybe BG\\'s \"Bling Bling\" is the most appropriate choice. Decisions, decisions. The life of an NFL prospect just got that much more complicated. BONUS: 25 of YouTube\\'s Funniest Sports Fails   Sports Fails        1. Golf Cart Fail  This runaway vehicle wreaked minor on-field havoc following a high school football championship in Texas last December. But a heroic bystander hopped aboard and put on the brakes. No casualties occurred, and the clip immediately became Internet legend.           2. Penalty Kick Fail Watch out for the ricochet, goalie! This kid gets it in the right in the chops.          3. Mascot on Rollerblades Fail What happens when you put an inflatable dinosaur on rollerblades and ask it to skate down a flight of stairs? Amazingness, that\\'s what.          4. Flopping Fail In sports, to \"flop\" is to exaggerate the force of contact in hopes of drawing a favorable call from officials. But you\\'ve got to time it much, much better than this guy does.          5. Hockey Celebration Fail Apparently, if you hug a member of the opposite team after scoring a goal in hockey, you will get punched in the face.          6. Innocent Bystander Fail This kid is just in the wrong place at the wrong time...to the benefit of the rest of us.          7. Representing Your School Fail  College football mascots are supposed to represent their schools in a fun, positive light — which doesn\\'t typically include picking fights. Here, the University of Oregon\\'s duck slams the University of Houston\\'s cougar. Bonus points for the sick elbow drop, though.           8. Weightlifting Fail  Not saying we could successfully lift 432 pounds above our heads, but dang, that looks painful. German weightlifter Matthias Steiner dropped this massive barbell on his neck during the London Olympics this summer, but escaped serious injury.           9. Trampoline Dunk Fail Sometimes, when you fail, you actually win.          10. Hurdling Fail  Why jump over hurdles when you could just RUN STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM? File under: Never, Ever Gets Old.           11. Paying Attention Fail After what could best be described as an \"optimistic\" shot attempt in a game last season, NBA center JaVale McGee showed some nice hustle getting back on defense. Only problem? His team still had the ball.          12. Judgment Fail But that wasn\\'t McGee\\'s only legendary moment. Here, he shows why it\\'s not a good idea to try dunking from the free throw line mid-game.          13. Olympic Promo Fail  For some reason, London\\'s Olympic promotions this summer involved hanging Mayor Boris Johnson on a zipline while waving a pair of tiny flags. Then he got stuck halfway through and it was pretty much the best, funniest, awkwardest thing that could have happened.           14. Grand Slam Celebration Fail Major Leaguer Kendry Morales broke his lower left leg while celebrating a game-winning grand slam in 2010. This edited video provides the before, during and after rundown.          15. Slam Dunk Fail See? White guys can jump? It\\'s just the landing that\\'s the hard part.          16. High Dive Fail The announcer here sums it up perfectly. She calls this attempt from the 1992 Olympics \"an absolute failed dive.\"          17. Piggyback Ride Fail What begins as an innocent enough piggyback ride atop a fuzzy mascot turns into a pretty epic collision — and YouTube gold.          18. Long Jump Fail Dude! If you\\'re gonna pump up the crowd like that, you can\\'t just faceplant into the sand.          19. Touchdown Celebration Fail When you think about it, is there any better way to celebrate a touchdown than by pegging an unsuspecting spectator in the face? Bonus points for originality, at least.          20. Pro Golfer Fail You\\'d think a professional golfer could put the ball in the hole with less than 16 strokes. Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open.          21. Head-First Slide Fail Well, that\\'s one way of doing it...right?          22. Time Management Fail  Tie game, clock winding down — it\\'s always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. This classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut\\'s Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011.           23. Boogie Boarding Fail Its veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack.          24. Sportsmanship Fail  The summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. So it makes perfect sense that he\\'d let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That\\'s what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video.           25. Standing on a Basketball Hoop Fail We\\'re not quite sure why this mascot thought standing on top of a basketball rim was a good idea.       ',\n",

       " \" “Kind of like a union?” I ask Craig Foster. “Eh, yeah,” he says, “except without the union part.” Foster, the CFO of Ubiquiti Networks, was in New York this week, in part to talk about the Ubiquiti World Network, a trade group that will bring together smaller wireless Internet service providers and give them what they really need: a lobbyist. Ubiquiti, whose chief executive officer, Robert Pera, was profiled in Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year, makes hardware that sends Internet signals over long distances without wires. Your phone carrier does this, but Ubiquiti’s customers, unlike your phone carrier, use unlicensed spectrum. That is, they don’t have an exclusive license from the Federal Communications Commission to transmit. Instead, they send their signals over certain, limited frequencies that have been set aside for anyone to use. Ubiquiti has focused its engineering talent on strengthening signals, sending them through cluttered airwaves, and filtering signal from noise at the other end. This has created for them a large customer base in emerging markets, where there’s less capital to spare for expensive fiber-optic networks. It’s a market large enough that Pera has been able to buy the Memphis Grizzlies. But there are also places in America, mostly rural, where wired infrastructure is too expensive to build. And there are places in America, mostly urban, where wired Internet access is too expensive to pay for. SEE ALSO: How Important Is Spectrum in Your Life?  Foster estimates that between 3,500 and 5,000 wireless Internet service providers serve these markets. I went to a meeting of them last year; WISPs, as they call themselves, tend to be small, run by engineers who get a kick out of solving problems while hanging by a clip from the top of a tower. It’s an industry still small enough that it calls its annual national conference “WISPapalooza.” The companies that use licensed spectrum — like your cellphone carrier — have pull in Washington, both directly and through trade groups like the CTIA. They need to, because they can’t operate without the licenses that come from the FCC. The WISPs, thus far, have no pull, because all they’ve needed from Washington is unlicensed spectrum, a public good that Washington already provides. It’s unfortunate but true that members of Congress, if they don’t have anyone calling them about an issue, assume that it’s unimportant and move on to the stuff that everyone’s yelling about. Which means that public goods don’t do well in Washington unless they happen to line up with some large company’s commercial interests. Net neutrality, like unlicensed spectrum, lowers the barrier to entry for new companies, and has found (somewhat) committed proponents as Google and Facebook increase the amounts of money they send back East. Earlier this year, Google cracked the top 10 in Washington in terms of dollars spent on lobbying. Facebook more than tripled its lobbying spend last year as well. (Although, these companies are only as benevolent as their own interests will allow them to be. On net neutrality, they line up on the same side as consumer groups. On privacy, they square off against them.) SEE ALSO: The New Lobbyists: Tech Takes Washington  This is the challenge that Ubiquiti, with its new network of WISPs, has to overcome. There are a lot of people in Washington who are paid to demand that the FCC free up more spectrum and license it to mobile phone carriers. They’ve been yelling about it for a while. So there’s little understanding in Congress that unlicensed spectrum can generate economic activity, too, even though no one owns exclusive access to it. In February, Yochai Benkler, a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, made a case for the potential of this market, pointing out that 87% of health-care wireless applications, for example, use unlicensed spectrum. Regulation hasn’t caught up with technology, Benkler argued. The FCC shouldn’t just be protecting unlicensed bands, but expanding them. Benkler’s academic ideas line up nicely with Ubiquiti’s financial interests, which gives the company a chance to champion what to Washington is still a new idea. I ask Foster what bands, in particular, he’s interested in lobbying the FCC to free up for unlicensed use. “We’re going to push for anything we can get our hands on” is his answer. The Ubiquiti World Network is going to hire a lobbyist, he says. “We’re a little bit green, but we have committed some money.” It will take a lot more than some.

       " ' Uber suspended operations in Nevada late Wednesday, after a Washoe County District Court judge granted the state\\'s request for a court order blocking the ride-sharing service. The judge said Uber\\'s refusal to comply with state laws regulating commercial motor carriers and passenger transportation services could put the public\\'s safety at risk.  Nevada\\'s attorney general filed a lawsuit last month arguing that the Internet application matching riders with drivers using personal cars for a fee infringes on the franchise rights of taxi companies and cabdrivers serving fare-paying passengers under state oversight. Washoe District Judge Scott Freeman granted the state\\'s request for a preliminary injunction pending a future trial. See also: Sorry, Travis, but I\\'m boycotting Uber Freeman\\'s Tuesday ruling came after Nevada Department of Business and Industry Director Bruce Breslow and Freeman himself praised the Uber application. Breslow said he has used it multiple times in other cities where it\\'s regulated. \"There\\'s no question it\\'s a wonderful product,\" Freeman said. \"But I\\'m charged with following the law — the law currently in existence ... I\\'m not going to risk the safety of the public.\" The Delaware-based Uber maintains it is a technology company, not a transportation-services company subject to Nevada regulations that apply to taxis or commercial motor carriers. The state is trying \"to compel a legal round peg into a square hole,\" said Don Campbell, a Las Vegas lawyer representing Uber. Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend said in a statement following Freeman\\'s ruling that the company will \"continue to work with regulators and state leaders as we evaluate this development,\" according to Bloomberg. \"We remain committed to working with Nevada\\'s leaders to create a permanent regulatory framework that affords Nevadans the flexibility and innovation offered by Uber,\" she said, Reuters reported. Behrend added that a shutdown of Uber would cost Nevada nearly 1,000 jobs. The news comes after a few tough weeks for Uber, when news surfaced that executive Emil Michael wanted to hire \"opposition researchers\" to dig up dirt on journalists who were critical of the company. It was also criticized for reportedly tracking a journalist without permission.

       " ' Forget about being insanely great, Apple\\'s plans for a new spaceship campus are becoming insanely expensive. Bloomberg Businessweek reports hearing from five sources close to the project that the budget for the new campus has surged from $3 billion when it was first proposed in 2011 to $5 billion now. That works out to be about $1,500 per square foot, according to Businessweek, which is more than most high-end office spaces. The biggest costs are apparently the materials being used to meet the vision for the new campus that Apple\\'s late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs originally laid out in the summer of 2011. \"As with Apple’s products, Jobs wanted no seam, gap, or paintbrush stroke showing; every wall, floor, and even ceiling is to be polished to a supernatural smoothness,\" Businessweek reports. \"All of the interior wood was to be harvested from a specific species of maple, and only the finer-quality “heartwood” at the center of the trees would be used, says one person briefed on the plan last year.\" The $5 billion price tag might not sound like too much for a company with a cash pile of well over $100 billion, but according to Businessweek, some of Apple\\'s bigger shareholders are grumbling about whether it\\'s the best use of Apple\\'s money. When Apple\\'s former CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs first presented the plans to the Cupertino City Council, the general perception from Wall Street to Main Street was that Apple could do no wrong. Now, a little less than two years later, the company\\'s stock has crashed back below $500 a share and people are questioning whether it has another breakthrough product up its sleeve. Apple, for its part, appears to be trying to avoid going too far over budget. Businessweek reports hearing from several sources that Apple has now pushed back the move-in date for the new campus to 2016 in order to work with lead architect Foster + Partners on finding ways to cut $1 billion from the construction costs.  Unlike some of the other things Apple has been criticized for in recent months, though, it\\'s hard to argue that this is something that wouldn\\'t have happened under Steve Jobs.

       " ' The U.S. Men\\'s National Team was drawn into the Group of Death for last summer\\'s World Cup in Brazil — and survived to reach the knockout stage. Now the U.S. Women\\'s National Team faces a similar challenge after being drawn into the Group of Death for the 2015 Women\\'s World Cup,  when foursomes for the tournament were announced on Saturday.  For those unfamiliar, the Group of Death is the name traditionally bestowed upon the World Cup\\'s toughest group of four teams who play one another, round-robin style, to decide which two will advance. It always means that at least one top-quality squad will be left on the outside looking in, while weaker teams from other, less formidable groups advance.  Indeed, the USWNT now finds itself preparing to square off against three very tough teams in Group D, when women\\'s soccer\\'s biggest event kicks off next summer in Canada.

USWNT star Alex Morgan was shocked to see where her squad landed.   “I’m kind of speechless,” - Alex Morgan on FoxSports1 re: #USWNT’s Group of Death draw — Planet Fútbol (@si_soccer) December 6, 2014  While the USMNT surprised many this past summer by surviving its own Group of Death to reach the 2014 World Cup\\'s knockout stage, there is one key difference when considering the U.S. women\\'s fate. A very, very key difference.  While the U.S. men\\'s team is a middle-of-the-pack international squad still striving to get eye-level with the world\\'s elite soccer nations, the U.S. women\\'s team is is ranked first in the world by FIFA and considered a global powerhouse. That means — even in a Group of Death — they are a favorite to advance. Despite its sterling reputation, however, the USWNT last won the Women\\'s World Cup in back 1999, when Brandi Chastain famously ripped off her jersey after scoring the game-winning goal in a penalty shootout against China.  Can the U.S. women advance from their Group of Death in 2015? Absolutely. Can they do so while avoiding major injuries and fatigue against extremely tough competition? That may be the bigger question. Will they win the 2015 Women\\'s World Cup, and make good on their no. 1 overall ranking? That\\'s far from a sure thing.

The engines roar, the nose lifts and the jetliner heads skyward once more. Crisis averted. It\\'s the classic \"go-around,\" in which a pilot aborts a landing, circles around and tries again, and it was caught on video at the airport in Barcelona, Spain, on Saturday.

       " ' When news of the Federal Communications Commissions\\' plan to consider paid priority on the Internet hit Reddit, the question wasn\\'t so much whether the move was a good idea, it was \"How do I best tell my elected representative that this is a horrible idea?\" Reddit is not the only corner of the Internet where the debate over net neutrality appears one-sided. Most tech commenters appear to be in lockstep on the issue. There is another side to the argument, though. A small minority are applauding the FCC\\'s potential move, often on libertarian grounds, though when the cable companies are talking, self-interest also plays a big role. Here are their five top arguments against net neutrality in principle: It gives the government more power over the Internet As journalist Glenn Greenwald reported, the NSA already tampers with U.S.-made routers for spying purposes.  If net neutrality went into effect, then the government would have to monitor the telecoms\\' and cable companies\\' broadband connections. Writing in Forbes, entrepreneur Joshua Steimie warned, \"Don’t be surprised if that means the government needs to be able to install its own hardware and software at critical points to monitor Internet traffic. Once installed, can we trust this government, or any government, to use that access in a benign fashion?\"   See also: FCC and net neutrality: What you need to know It\\'s not a free market solution If the government enforces net neutrality it would essentially be impeding what had been a free market. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the cable industry\\'s primary lobbying group, argues that regulating the Internet like a utility — one of the ideas being considered — is dumb. \"Imposing regulations designed for century-old utilities will only choke off growth and investment,\" the group reasons.  As former FCC Chairman and NCTA president and CEO Michael Powell wrote in a recent op-ed, giving the FCC power over regulating rates for broadband would \"fracture confidence that our national broadband policy rests squarely on a light regulatory foundation. Network investment would suffer, and the push to reach more households would slow.\"  Little regulation has worked fine until now Though there has been more than $1 trillion invested in the Internet since the \\'90s, as Powell argues, the federal government has had a very light touch. That is not entirely by choice, as FCC regulation has twice been struck down by a federal appeals court. Today, wired or wireless broadband reaches 99% of Americans and connections running 100 Mpbs and faster are available in 85% of homes, the NCTA argues.  Classifying the Internet as a common carrier service wouldn\\'t have the intended effect  This is the argument Comcast EVP David Cohen put forth recently. \"There is nothing in Title II that provides authority for saying that all [Web] services have to be treated the same,\" he said this week at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit. That is, even if the Internet was considered a utility, cable companies like Comcast could still initiate tiered pricing. Charging everyone the same price isn\\'t fair Cohen continued that the days of all-you-can-eat pricing are coming to an end. Within five years he expects Comcast to charge based on usage.  “People who use more should pay more, and people who use less should pay less,\" he said. Data caps will be high enough that most customers won\\'t notice them, he says. Going back to the utilities metaphor, that\\'s the same way it works with electricity, gas and water. ',\n",

Apart from that, the company says the data it is releasing constitutes \"all the information we are legally allowed to share.\" See also: Experts: Yes, Apple and the NSA Can Read Your iMessages The data published reflects requests from Jan. 1, 2013, to June 30, 2013. The company divides requests into two categories: those about accounts, which contain personal information, and those about devices, which arise in cases of stolen or missing iPhones or iPads.  In the first category, Apple reveals that the United States government has requested information on 2,000 to 3,000 user accounts. For these requests, a gag order on data related to national security prevented Apple from specifying how many times it released information. Instead, it used a range; the company said it released data for between zero and 1,000 accounts. Even released in ranges, the number of requests from the U.S. is far higher than the number of requests from any other country. Only Spain and the UK requested information on more than 100 accounts.   The law enforcement in the U.S. asked for information on 8,605 devices. Brazil and Germany followed, with 5,027 and 4,928 respectively.  In the report, Apple also took a swipe at some of its competitors, noting that collecting user data is not part of their business model. (We can guess they might mean Google.) \"Our business does not depend on collecting personal data. We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customer,\" the report reads. \"Unlike many other companies dealing with requests for customer data from government agencies, Apple’s main business is not about collecting information.\" Notably, Apple also specified that it has never received a so-called business record order, the kind of order used by the U.S. government to allow the NSA to collect virtually all U.S. phone records.  \"Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act,\" the report reads. \"We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us.\" Image: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Apple ',\n",

       " ' Children around the world aren\\'t the only ones having an Easter egg hunt today. Astronauts in space will get Easter treats, too. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who commands the International Space Station, made sure that the Easter Bunny would make a special trip to the orbital lab today (March 31) just in time for a celebration of Easter in space. \"Good Morning, Earth! A fine Easter Sunday morning to you from the crew of the International Space Station,\" Hadfield wrote in a post on Twitter. He\\'s using the social media service to chronicle his mission under the name @Cmdr_Hadfield. Hadfield snapped a sunrise photo of Earth on Easter showing the sun glinting off the Great Lakes in North America this morning to mark the occasion: Photo courtesy Canadian Space Agency/Chris Hadfield Then he revealed his Easter secret. \"Don\\'t tell my crew, but I brought them Easter Eggs :),\" Hadfield wrote as he posted a photo of his space Easter treats:  Photo courtesy Canadian Space Agency/Chris Hadfield As you can see in the photo, six large plastic Easter eggs — each a different color  — float inside a plastic bag while Hadfield presses a finger to his lips in a \"Shh\" gesture. SEE ALSO: Astronaut Demonstrates the Bizarre Experience of Living in Space  Easter Sunday is a day off for the space station crew because it falls on a weekend. Hadfield is Canada\\'s first commander of the station and took charge of the orbiting laboratory earlier in March. Hadfield\\'s Expedition 35 crew includes himself, two Americans and three Russians. Three crewmembers, American astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin, just arrived at the station on Thursday (March 28). Astronauts in space have a long tradition of spending holidays in space. It dates back decades to the early days of human spaceflight, when NASA astronauts celebrated Christmas orbiting the moon during the 1968 Apollo 8 mission. Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year\\'s Day and other traditional holidays from Russia and other space station partner countries have been celebrated in space since the first crew took up residence in the orbiting laboratory in 2000. The space station has been manned by rotating crews ever since. Hadfield has shown a dedication to marking holidays off the planet. In March, he donned a green shirt and bowtie for St. Patrick\\'s Day, and in February he wore a heart headband for Valentine\\'s Day and a funny hat and necklace for Mardi Gras. Hadfield and two Expedition 35 crewmates — NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko — are due to return to Earth in May. They have been living on the space station in since mid-December.

       " ' KIEV, Ukraine — President Viktor Yanukovych conceded some ground to anti-government protesters on Tuesday, accepting the resignation of the country’s Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and Azarov’s cabinet.  Azarov said he had decided to step down “for the sake of a peaceful settlement” to the current political turmoil in Ukraine. See also: 9 Essential Twitter Sources for Ukrainian Conflict News In a statement posted to the government website Tuesday morning as lawmakers filed into Ukraine’s parliament, Azarov wrote that he had asked President Yanukovych to accept his resignation “in order to create additional possibilities for socio-political compromise [and] to deal with the conflict peacefully.” “Today, the most important thing is to preserve the unity and integrity of Ukraine,” Azarov said. “That is far more important than anyone’s personal plans or ambitions. And that is exactly why I have taken this decision.” Vitali Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion who is now  leader of the opposition UDAR party, called Azarov’s resignation “a face-saving measure,” adding that it would not be enough to quell anti-government protests now in their third month. \"It’s not a victory. It’s only a step to the victory,” Klitschko said. His comments echoed those of opposition Batkivshchyna party lawmaker Andriy Pavlovsky. “It’s a small step to resolve the confrontation,” he said. Later in the afternoon, Yanukovych appointed Azarov’s first deputy, Sergey Arbuzov, as acting prime minister, according to a statement from the government website. Arbuzov previously headed Ukraine’s central bank and has been closely tied to Yanukovych’s so-called “family.” Days earlier, President Yanukovych had offered the position to head the government to opposition leader Arseniy Yatseniuk of the Batkivschyna party, saying that if he accepted, Azarov would be out. During a closed-door meeting between opposition leaders and the president to discuss solutions to the political crisis on Monday, Yatseniuk said he had turned down the president’s offer. Taras Berezovets, director of Kiev-based political consultancy Berta Communications, predicated that businessman Petro Poroshenko, also an opposition member of parliament, would be made the next prime minister as a compromise choice between Yanukoych and the political opposition. The comments of Hanna Herman, a lawmaker from the pro-presidential Party of Regions, seemed to bolster this idea. She said the new prime minister would be a person “with a broad view of the world.” “We offered for the opposition to lead the government; we wanted it to be a coalition government, but the opposition was neither prepared nor willing to do it,” she added, referring to Batkivshchyna leader Yatseniuk’s refusal on Monday to step into the position. Separately, lawmakers met in an extraordinary parliament session, where they voted overwhelmingly to repeal a package of anti-protest laws pushed through parliament and quickly signed by President Yanukovych on Jan. 16, which severely restricted the rights to freedom of assembly and speech in the country. \"We revoked the laws against which all the country has revolted,\" Yatseniuk said, adding that the president should immediately sign the repeal of the legislation into law. The passage of the laws triggered tense and sometimes violent standoffs between police and radical protesters in recent days, resulting in hundreds of injuries on both sides of the lines and the deaths of at least three protesters. Police have fired rubber bullets and live ammunition indiscriminately at protesters who have lobbed Molotov cocktails and stones into their ranks. The violent clashes led to fears that Yanukovych would declare a state of emergency, which would grant him the extrajudicial powers to impose a curfew and mobilize the military to force protesters from their camp on Kiev\\'s Independence Square. On Sunday, Justice Minister Olena Lukash threatened to ask the government to declare a state of emergency after a militant group of protesters called Spilna Sprava (Common Cause) seized her building. They later vacated the building but continued to block access to it. The cancelation of the laws is just one on a list of demands from opposition leaders and anti-government protesters. They have also demanded that President Yanukovych resign, that snap elections be held ahead of scheduled elections in 2015, that amnesty be granted to all protesters who have participated in demonstrations and that those who have been detained during the demonstrations be released. The protests in Ukraine first began in late November, when President Yanukovych spurned a long-anticipated trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, which in December agreed to by $15 billion of Ukrainian bonds to keep the cash-strapped country from falling into a financial abyss. The largely peaceful protests intensified in early December after police violently dispersed a group of protesters comprised of mainly university students and then again in January when Yanukovych signed into law sweeping new anti-protest legislation.

       " \" Instagram has something big up its sleeve. The photo-sharing platform and Facebook subsidiary will make a rare appearance in New York City on Thursday for an unveiling, and no one knows for certain what its announcement will be. I do, however, have a pretty good idea. My money is on a new, live communication platform within Instagram. Think Snapchat meets, well, Instagram. I suspect Instagram will introduce the following:  Instagram Chats that include a messaging or chat function for real-time discussion. A suite of tools for enhancing images with text (MEME and standard captions) and more conversational imagery. A contact system overhaul that allows you to see, with permission, who else is live and ready to chat on Instagram. The ability to make chat-based or direct Instagrams temporary. In other words, they can disappear in one day, five minutes or two weeks. Perhaps those intervals will be adjustable by the user.  The option to make Instagrams private, shared between only a group of Instagram friends or with just one other user.  The art and captioning tools will extend beyond traditional Instagram filters and allow users to draw on images and add icons and avatars.  Instagram may also push the envelope and include video in this communication toolkit, though I have trouble envisioning exactly how. We’re Still Cool Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. A mostly hands-off approach has given way to firmer control of the social media brand and its updates. When Instagram unveiled Instagram video earlier this year, for example, it was Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg who delivered the news. This time, however, the invitation makes no mention of Facebook, and it’s highly unlikely that Zuckerberg will show up in New York to introduce Instagram’s communication platform. The reason is obvious enough. First of all, an Instagram communication platform would be designed to help Instagram compete with the rapidly growing teen favorite Snapchat. The growth of the image-sharing startup is meteoric; in just a few months, the number of photos shared on the platform doubled from 200 million to the current 400 million. If you don’t count video, that number outstrips Facebook’s daily photo share count by 50 million. For comparison, Instagram’s 130 million users share roughly 55 million photos each day. Facebook needs Instagram to help bolster its share numbers, so why isn’t the social media giant taking center stage at this announcement? Because teens don’t like Facebook. While that’s a very broad statement, there are some hard numbers to support this, aside from anecdotal evidence. A recent Piper Jaffray study asked more than 7,000 teens to rank social networks by preference. Initially, the news looked good: Facebook remains the most important social network to teens, with Twitter as a close second. However, the trend line is not favorable. The report shows a significant decline in Facebook interest among teens between spring 2012 and spring 2013. Twitter declined as well, but only slightly. Instagram remained flat between fall 2012 and spring 2103.  A Pew study also acknowledged this trend. It said 77% of surveyed teens are on Facebook, but their interest is “waning.” I see some of these trends in my own world. Neither of my teen children are active on Facebook; they prefer Tumblr and Instagram. I recently came across a full-page article in the newspaper of one of our local high schools devoted to why students don’t use Facebook. It prematurely described Facebook as “dead.” And, of course, there’s this. Zuckerberg insists teens aren’t leaving, but he also said the “cool” has left the building, or something to that effect. Whether or not Facebook executives think the platform has a teen problem, I’d say they are savvy enough to know that an announcement with “Facebook” in the lead could very well turn off teens. Instagram, though, is still cool. Many of their idols (think Nikki Minaj, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber) are active on the service. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a celebrity or two help Instagram demonstrate its new capabilities on Thursday. This Better Work I could be dead wrong about this. Instagram could unveil a piece of hardware to help you view your favorite Instagrams or some new integration with Facebook best friend, Microsoft’s Windows 8. But those options seem very unlikely.  Facebook cannot allow chat and messaging apps like Keek, the international darling WhatsApp and Snapchat to steal its teen thunder. Instagram remains its best way into teens' mobile hearts and hands. Teens may treat Facebook like Gmail users treat Google+, but they will still, more or less, be engaged with the service. The closer Facebook can get teens to hold Instagram in their social spheres, the better chance it will have of reintroducing them to the platform.

       " \" This week we celebrate Ada Lovelace, a woman from the 1800s who invented computer programming at a time when no one knew what a computer was.  While her contributions are vast, I can’t help but imagine how much she may have impacted society had she been properly educated. And then I begin to think about how important it is to recognize the movements and groups that educate and offer opportunities to women.   See also: We Asked Sally Ride All the Wrong Questions Arduino and Raspberry Pi, for instance, are a single-board microcontroller and a single-board computer, respectively, that provide low-cost options to teach programming. Because of this access to computing materials, women have developed numerous applications and learned the craft of programming. Imagine what women can develop when given resources of this caliber.  And it doesn't stop at just providing skills, but also encouragement.  The Girl Effect is a movement that aims to grasp the potential of women and drive massive resources toward them so they can help change the world. Consisting of 508 girls living in poverty and 25 of the world's leading development organizations, it is dedicated to improving education, health, economic security and citizenship for impoverished women. The ambition and actions of girls is what we need so all women can make great strides in developing themselves and in educating their peers in science, technology, engineering and math.   You can also see a glimpse of the global future of women’s education with BBOXX, which brings electricity and light to Africa with low-cost equipment distributed by Africans for Africans. Just having access to light at home will fundamentally change the education level in some of the poorest nations in the world and open to access to schooling to women.  Barriers to women’s access to technology and education are coming down, which is paving the way for women to have a significant influence on the future of innovation. Just this year, Abigail Cohen, along with her partner Andrew Brimer, won the IEEE Presidents’ Change the World Competition with their Low-Cost Spirometer, a wireless tool to measure the amount of air channeling through the lungs. This machine has dropped the price point from $1,000 to $100 and can help address the rising cost of chronic respiratory diseases worldwide. If given the proper tools, women have the power to drive the development of technologies that we can’t even conceive of today. I’m confident that we will be celebrating another great woman in 2188, like we are Ada on her day.

See also: Malala Yousafzai\\'s Alleged Shooters Arrested in Pakistan Malala, a schoolgirl and education campaigner from Pakistan who was shot twice in the head by the Taliban in 2012, accepted the award with humility and grace. \"I really believe in peace.

In true form, Yousafzai waited until after her school day was complete to speak to the press, hours after the Nobel Prize\\'s announcement (she got word of the win while in chemistry class). \"Despite her youth, Malala YousafzaI has already fought for several years for the right of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations,\" the Nobel committee said in a statement. \"This she has done under the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle she has become a leading spokesperson for girls’ rights to education.\" Yousafzai, and Kailash Satyarthi of India, shared the Nobel Peace Prize for work fighting extremism and child labor at great risk to their own lives.  Yousafzai said that the award going to people from the two neighboring countries demonstrated a new step in the peace process between the often-feuding nations. \"We will try to build strong relationships between India and Pakistan,\" she said, adding that she and Satyarthi planned to invite the leaders of their countries to the official acceptance event.  Yousafzai said she hoped that her receipt of the award would encourage children internationally to speak out for their rights. “I decided that I would speak up. Through my story I want to tell other children all around the world they should stand up for their rights,\" said Yousafzai. \"They should not wait for someone else.

Yousafzai addressed the United Nations Youth Assembly in July 2013 following her recovery.   Malala chatted with Ban Ki Moon via Skype in April 2013 after her recovery.   Malala spoke out on the rights for girls in education on the International Day of the Girl    Yousafzai met with newly arrived refugees at the Jordan-Syria border in February to speak with Syrian refugee children with UNHCR.

After the first revelations of secret National Security Agency surveillance programs stared coming out at the beginning of the summer of 2013, Internet giants began to deny their involvement, and push for more transparency. Some companies, like Facebook, Apple and Yahoo, published their first transparency reports. See also: Google Reports 68% Spike in Government Censorship Requests Verizon, AT&T and other telecom companies, reportedly hand in all their customers\\' phone records to the NSA. But the companies remained practically silent for six months, except for when they answered a series of questions posed by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.).  Their answers revealed that they had received 1.1 million data requests in 2012. No data about 2013 was released. Then, on Dec. 19, Verizon announced it would soon publish data on the government requests it had received. And AT&T followed Verizon\\'s lead the next day. But Verizon and AT&T have still to fulfill their promises. CREDO Mobile, which bills itself as a \"business that works for progressive social change,\" stole their thunder on Thursday. \"CREDO has a decades-long record fighting for the civil liberties, not just of our phone customers, but of all Americans,” Michael Kieschnick, CEO of CREDO, said in a press release. \"Despite the shocking revelations of NSA abuses, the U.S. government continues to defend unconstitutional programs to systematically spy on Americans. So it’s up to companies like ours to lift the curtain to the extent allowed by law and fight for our customers’ constitutional rights.\" CREDO\\'s transparency report isn\\'t that revealing: in 2013 the company only received a grand total of 16 data requests from federal, state, and local authorities.

Interestingly, CREDO also has a detailed break down of each requests, listing the agency that issued it, and even precisely what kind of request it was — whether it was an administrative subpoena, a grand jury subpoena, or an emergency request, for example.  Just like what Internet giants did in their own reports, CREDO also denounced the gag order it is subjected to when it comes to data requests related to national security issues, including those coming from the NSA or the FBI through the controversial National Security Letters. \"It may not be possible for CREDO or any telecom carrier to release to the public a full transparency report,\" the company wrote on its site. \"As the USA PATRIOT Act and other statutes give law enforcement the ability to prevent companies from disclosing whether or not they have received certain orders.\" Image: Sean Gallup/Getty Images News/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' Humans are able stick their arms into cluttered areas like a refrigerator or reach across a table set for dinner without knocking anything over. Robots aren’t so good at that. In fact, until now, researchers generally design robots to not touch anything except for the object for which they’re reaching. However, a robotic arm developed by a team lead by Charlie Kemp, associate professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, has sensors that cover its entire “arm,” helping it touch other objects gently, while reaching for a specific item. The technique gives robots a more effective and realistic method for dealing with real-world circumstances, where obstacles and clutter are usually an issue. SEE ALSO: 5 Major Advances in Robotic Prosthetics  Kemp’s robots have reached through artificial foliage and piles of cinder blocks that search-and-rescue robots might run into. In a particularly apt real-world exercise, Kemp’s team designed a robot arm that assisted a paraplegic. The robot was able to wipe the subject’s face with a cloth and pull a blanket over him (if slowly). SEE ALSO: Excellent Idea of the Day: Robonaut Exoskeleton  One of the things that can make robots terrible personal assistants is that they can’t always deal with the ordinary bumps and irregularities that would go into being around people. But the work with the paraplegic patient, who told observers he felt pretty safe around the machine, shows that it’s possible to teach them that. Coupled with a better sense of touch and training for both robots and people, this kind of work might open the way for more robot assistants for people with physical problems. The team is presenting the research at the International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics in June and published results in the International Journal of Robotics Research.

For example, there is exactly one Buddhist in the Senate. And only seven senators were worth less than $100,000 in 2011. One senator was a carpenter before being elected.

       " ' Matt Bonner, the quirky star power forward/center for the San Antonio Spurs, became the first NBA player to get an endorsement deal via Twitter, but it wasn\\'t with the brand he originally sought. As Bonner told ESPN, for a while he believes he was the only player in the league to sport New Balance basketball shoes. Despite abuse from fans, he stuck with his choice even though he wasn\\'t getting paid to endorse the brand. \"I took a lot of flak for wearing them,\" he told ESPN. \"I got heckled quite a bit. Things like, \\'Hey, Bonner, nice New Balances.\\' Nothing really all that clever; 99.99% of heckles are not clever.\" See also: 20 NBA Twitter Accounts to Make This Season a Slam Dunk Taking pity on Bonner, the sneaker blog NiceKicks let him run its account for an hour last October.

Any takers?#history — Nice Kicks (@nicekicks) October 21, 2013  New Balance responded with alacrity, but didn\\'t answer his question exactly:  .@newbalance @Adidas @peaksportsUSA I\\'m ready to sign the fist ever shoe deal via twitter.

As ESPN reports, though, Bonner got his fairy tale ending anyway when Adidas contacted him. Bonner wound up signing a contract with the sneaker brand earlier this year and no longer wears New Balance. Reps from New Balance could not be reached about why the brand spurned its biggest advocate in the NBA. Bonner, who is known for his blog The Sandwich Hunter, which chronicles his quest to find the perfect sandwich, is known for other odd pursuits. For instance, in his first two years in the NBA playing for the Toronto Raptors he didn\\'t own a car so he took the city\\'s Red Rocket streetcars everywhere and earned the nickname the Red Rocket. (He\\'s also known as Red Mamba, a nickname Kobe Bryant bestowed on him via Twitter.)  Now that he has an endorsement deal, Bonner\\'s not taking any chances. ESPN reports that he has 20 pairs of Adidases stored in his garage just in case the brand dumps him.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Attention is the currency of the Internet, and the brands that can capture and capitalize on it stand to gain a great deal. Their conversions increase, their acquisition rate will improve and their bounce rate will lower. Perhaps just as importantly for businesses, marketers will be able to know if the time and money they invested in creating a campaign was well spent. See also: Why People Unsubscribe From Your Email List “You have to be obsessed, diligent, genuine and personal to win over your customers at every turn. To keep customers happy and engaged across every channel, you have to be customer-obsessed first and foremost,” says Michael Blumenfeld, consultant for U.S. financial/insurance services at Maxymiser. In our Metrics That Matter series, Mashable is speaking with digital marketers about the metrics they pay attention to and why. While creativity and originality are key components of a successful campaign, it\\'s also essential to analyze and evaluate the campaign while it\\'s running and after it\\'s finished to gauge success and ROI, and learn lessons for future campaigns. Many marketers turn to A/B testing and in-page analytics to learn what\\'s working and tweak campaigns. Sort Through the Noise \"The amount of data we as marketers are privy to in today\\'s business world is both a gift and a curse,\" says Dan Scalco, the founder of Digitalux.  There’s more knowledge about customers than ever before, but there are also mountains of data to sift through. On top of that, there\\'s the challenge of turning data into actionable, measurable conclusions. Image: Flickr, infocux \"This is where A/B and multivariate testing, real-time data and micro-segment discovery all become mission-critical in creating customer experiences of the personalized kind,” says Blumenfeld. A/B testing, as opposed to multivariate testing, isolates one variable in your campaign and serves up an alternate version (version B) to a segment of your visitors, while the remaining visitors receive the original version (version A). You can then track how a particular metric correlates with each version and evaluate success. It\\'s essentially a controlled experiment, in which you can isolate the effects of a specific change. Suppose you wanted to determine whether a call-to-action button was more effective in green or red. The A/B test would serve up a red version to some visitors, and the green version to others. By changing only the button color and measuring how many people sign up, you can learn whether red or green is more effective and update the design accordingly.  See also: How a 113-Year-Old Company Boosted Holiday Sales on Facebook Other testing variables could be copy wording, images, colors or fonts. Any detail can be A/B tested — and tech giants such as Google famously use the method. “A/B testing provides actionable data that enables marketers to deliver a better experience to customers at scale,” says Dan Siroker, CEO of Optimizely. In the past, A/B testing required weeks of planning, coding and execution. Optimizely is one of a new crop of companies making A/B testing simple and easy to use, eliminating what had been one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption.  Observe and Adjust Crafting engaging messages depends on knowing what your target audience responds to. “With the ever increasing impressions on the Internet, understanding what drives consumers to act is critical. Being able to systematically test is now a \\'must-have\\' discipline for all digital marketers,” says Lawrence Whittle, SVP of business development at Persado. The difference between the results of the best and worst campaigns is 800%, says Whittle, and that translates to real money on the line.  Another benefit of A/B testing is that you collect data — and upticks — in real time. “We see immediate lifts in clicks and time spent on-site when we A/B test,” says Kellee Khalil, founder and CEO of Loverly. The wedding planning site focuses heavily on user retention metrics, because once a user crosses a certain threshold of engagement, she’s likely to continue using the site and even become a \"power user.\" A/B testing optimizes the homepage elements and other aspects of the experience to encourage conversion and engagement. Engage Across Platforms Image: Flickr, zergev Optimization across devices is becoming more important as traffic and audience tilt toward mobile. “We A/B test landing pages like crazy and are in a constant state of design and redesign with landing page templates to ensure we can capture all users across all devices,” says Alexis Anderson, director of marketing & partnerships at PureWow. Know What to Look For Marketers must consider key measurements when A/B testing. The validity of the test depends on looking at the right metric in the right way. Siroker suggests that marketers identify “common, quantifiable success metrics that will be present in every experiment that is run.\" These metrics should tie in to other in-page analytics, such as homepage bounce rates, category or product page views, and all stages of the purchasing funnel. Thoughtful, well-designed A/B tests can point to conclusions that are counterintuitive, or would otherwise have been missed. Coupled with the right in-page analytics, A/B testing is a valuable tool that guides marketers toward more effective campaigns and improves user experience, paying off for both companies and their customers alike.

       " ' Since taking over as the CEO of Yahoo nearly 18 months ago, Marissa Mayer has pushed many of the right buttons.  Company stock more than doubled. The company has five times as many mobile employees as when she first started. In July, Yahoo registered more web traffic in the U.S. than Google for the first time since 2011.  See also: 10 Apps You Need to Dominate Your Work Day Mayer\\'s success has created a sort of fan following, including one big admirer with a company of his own: Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce. At Salesforce\\'s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Benioff asked Mayer to share her advice on how she keeps things running smoothly. In a room full of tech entrepreneurs and startup executives, it was a question begging for an answer. \"One of [former NFL Coach Vince Lombardi\\'s] sayings was, \\'my priorities are God, family and the Green Bay Packers in that order,\\'\" Mayer, a Wisconsin native, replied. \"I now joke that mine are God, family and Yahoo. Except I\\'m not that religious, so it\\'s really family and Yahoo.\" The key, Mayer said, is prioritizing what\\'s most important each day. She takes inspiration from a former college friend, who used to make a to-do list every day, from the most important to the least important tasks on her plate. Instead of getting overwhelmed by the long list of items left unfinished, the friend would celebrate the fact that she never finished her list.  That would mean spending lots of time on relatively unimportant tasks, Mayer explained. \"If I did [get to the bottom of the list] it would be a real bummer,\" Mayer said. \"Because think about all those things at the very bottom of your to-do list that really shouldn\\'t take time out of your day.\" Tuesday\\'s keynote didn\\'t just touch on how Mayer schedules her time. The CEO also talked at length about Yahoo\\'s commitment to simplistic design and how the company is seeking a SVP of design to report directly to her.  Mayer also said that Yahoo has nearly 400 million monthly active mobile users, up from 300 million monthly actives on mobile in Q1.  Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' Christmas just came six weeks late for basketball nerds.  The NBA will launch a new tool at midnight EST on Friday that gives hardcore and casual hoops fans alike access to an overwhelming amount of historical stats and data. Found at NBA.com/Stats, it includes box scores for every game dating back to the NBA\\'s first season in 1946, as well as deep historical dives on player performance and effective team combinations.  Users will be able to access an incredible total of 4.5 quadrillion statistical combinations, according to Ken De Gennaro, the NBA\\'s vice president of information technology.  Powered by the enterprise and analytics software company SAP, NBA.com/Stats appears to be an unprecedented step by a sports league into officially opening the gates of big data for fans. SEE ALSO: How Social Media and Snoop Dogg Helped a Fledgling NBA Team  A demo of the tool earlier this week was really impressive, with a pleasant interface complementing a staggering array of statistical combinations and insights.  Just a few clicks, for example, brought up a comparison of Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant\\'s rebounding numbers in wins vs. losses. A couple more narrowed that comparison down to just home wins vs. home losses. A couple more narrowed it down further to home wins against Eastern Conference teams, then home wins against Western Conference teams.  Color-coded court diagrams showed Durant\\'s shooting performance from different spots on the floor — where he shot from most and how successful he was from each region — during his rookie year compared to this season. A couple more clicks called up a chart of this season\\'s best players in a variety of clutch situations.   Essentially, the common fan now has ready access to stats and diagrams previously only available to scouts and media.  \"The idea is that you can go as deep as you basically want,\" De Gennaro tells Mashable. \"You can look at stories that are presented to you, or just start asking questions to your heart\\'s content by changing date ranges, points during the game, when a team wins vs. loses, player vs. player situations, anything you want.\"  SEE ALSO: George Stephanopoulos Thought This NBA Legend Was Morgan Freeman  An editorial component rounds out all the number crunching. It highlights certain stats and box scores from famous games, as well as contains a glossary section that explains some of the more advanced stats.

Typhoon Haiyan, which ripped through Philippines in November 2013, has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon. However, damage to the airport and roads have made moving the aid into the most affected areas very difficult. With dead bodies left out in the open air and very limited food, water and shelter, health concerns became prevalent.

Officials reported rocks raining down over a large area, forcing thousands to flee their homes. The Indonesian government called for people living within five kilometers (3.1 miles) of the volcano, on the northern tip of Sumatra Island, to evacuate their homes as the volcanology agency raised the alert level for the volcano to the highest point on a four-stage scale.

       " ' Headline magnet Miley Cyrus is leading Time magazine\\'s Person of the Year online poll, with nearly 28% of the votes as of Thursday night. The pop star is ahead of former NSA defense contractor Edward Snowden, as well as notable figures in politics, religion and entertainment. The poll winner, which will be revealed Dec. 6, isn\\'t necessarily the person who becomes Time\\'s Person of the Year, as the editors will pick and then announce that honor on Dec. 11. See also: Miley Cyrus Sings Funny \\'We Did Stop (The Government)\\' on \\'SNL\\' Cyrus, 21, has no doubt had a commercially successful 2013, drumming up massive amounts of social buzz, YouTube views and music sales due to a combination of talent and controversial antics. The singer\\'s twerk-filled MTV VMAs performance dominated social conversations for months, her nude \"Wrecking Ball\" video earned the record for most views in 24 hours, and she helped \"twerk\" get added to Oxford Dictionaries Online.   Whether those ingredients warrant the title of Person of the Year is solely up to Time\\'s editors. But if history is any indication, Cyrus won\\'t win.  The prestigious honor has routinely gone to world leaders (U.S. President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008; Vladimir Putin in 2007; George W. Bush in 2004 and 2000) or groups of people (protestor in 2011; \"you\" in 2006; good samaritans in 2005; the American soldier in 2003). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earned the title in 2010, while Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke received it in 2009.  Time uses its reader poll to keep its finger on the pulse of public sentiment. The magazine even added a Twitter component this year to encourage more participation. However, a pair of programmers are trying to make a mockery of the Poptip poll by claiming that they\\'ve rigged it to cast multiple votes for Cyrus, according to The Daily Dot. \"Time and Poptip are aware of the efforts to affect the results of the Person of the Year poll, and have measures in place so that only legitimate votes are being incorporated in the final tally,\" a Time spokesperson told Mashable. \"We\\'re delighted that so many people are having fun with this informal poll and contributing to the conversation [about who should win]. \"  Update:Poptip told Mashable that Cyrus\\' ranking doesn\\'t take into account any spammed votes. Only authentic votes have been tallied.  Over the years, Time\\'s poll efforts have encountered setbacks. Last year, programmers built software that resulted in North Korean President Kim Jong-un taking home the title, while in 2009, 4chan rallied to move its founder Christopher Poole to the top of the rankings.  Cyrus\\' voting page describes her as follows: \"The artist formerly known as Hannah Montana got tongues wagging — beyond her own —with a scantily clad, twerk-filled performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and meme-able hit videos.\" On Twitter, Cyrus has retweeted fans who are encouraging their followers to vote for her. Time has chosen a Person of the Year honoree since 1927 when American aviator Charles Lindbergh won.

       " ' Before MakerBot, no one could have conceived of Napster for fashion. A Burberry trench couldn\\'t be replicated digitally, which meant the garment industry was more or less safe from the revolution that upended music production and book publishing. But with 3D printing, Fifth Avenue is headed for its own disruptive moment.  See also: 3D Printing Is a Matter of Life and Death 3D printers can manufacture spare parts for spacecraft, produce food and housing, even replicate human organs. Simultaneously, the materials used in 3D printers are improving by leaps and bounds, incorporating metals and plastics, wood and nylon. New York-based Shapeways has begun selling 3D-printed objects, including jewelry, while Continuum has created a 3D-printed bikini with plastic pieces that snap together. And a San Francisco-based entrepreneur is currently experimenting with a printer that can create garments out of polymer fabrics — the future of 3D-printed textiles. \"We are living a world in which fashion and design take on a personal element,\" says Jonathan Askin, a professor with the Brooklyn Law School and a consultant in Internet law. \"The same way anyone is now a publisher or a music distributor, now almost everyone can become a fashion creator.\"  At the moment, 3D-printed fashion exists mainly in the world of haute couture. Iris Van Herpen\\'s skeleton dress (see below) and the angel wings that debuted at the 2013 Victoria\\'s Secret Fashion Show are artful, sure, but not particularly wearable. There\\'s still a long way to go before we\\'re all sporting 3D-printed blouses and yoga pants. In the world of tech, however, \"a long way\" can sometimes mean just a few years. If 3D-printed bracelets and rings are already well within consumers\\' budgets, how far behind are sneakers and tank tops? As 3D printing evolves, it will introduce new conflicts into the already murky arena of copyright law. The community built around 3D printing embraces open-source code and designs rather than tightly protected trade secrets. MakerBot\\'s Thingiverse is the pioneer in that space, offering all kinds of open-source, customizable and printable items, including jewelry.   A model wears a creation by Iris Van Herpen for the Fall-Winter 2011-2012 Haute Couture fashion collection presented in Paris, Monday, July 4, 2011. Image: Francois Mori/Associated Press\"We\\'ll no longer have to buy a suit off the rack and hope it fits. We\\'ll no longer have to buy a dress with that particular belt or ribbon,\" says Askin. \"We can tailor everything to suit our own specific desires.\"  Three-dimensional scanning and modeling means anything, including haute couture, can be reverse-engineered with enough time and effort, paving the way for major breakthroughs in counterfeiting. Hack the code for a Chanel bangle, get your hands on a MakerBot and you\\'ve engaged a brand new version of fashion piracy.  As a safeguard, the garment industry will likely lobby for the kind of comprehensive copyright protection that music and film enjoy, to protect their designs from counterfeiters. (Copyright law is what generates all those broken links for TV shows illegally shared on YouTube.) At a recent Eyebeam Art and Technology Center panel in New York, Askin describes the situation in terms of copyright law as, essentially, the wild west. \"In a world where the law is suspect, the law doesn\\'t exist,\" he says.   New Balance is introducing sneakers that use 3-D printing to create a plate on the sole of the shoe that is supposed to enhance performance with every step. Image: New Balance/Associated PressThe Chanels and the Hugo Bosses of the world are used to having their designs copied and counterfeited, though. High-end designers create luxe items, which fast fashion companies like Forever 21 and their ilk modify at a much lower price point. The couturiers don\\'t like it, and they sue when they can. But while Chanel can police for knockoff quilted bags sold discreetly on Canal Street, they can\\'t do much to keep Forever 21 from altering the design of a quilted bag just enough to get away with it.  \"Fashion uses inspiration from previous designs to create new designs,\" says Liz Bacelar, founder of Decoded Fashion, at the Eyebeam panel. \"There is always someone saying that [a designer] copied something, it\\'s just the culture of creation between artists in fashion.\" When and if the Thingiverse of fashion exists, companies may take the practice one step further, trafficking in selling code the way iTunes sells songs. Perhaps for $5, you\\'ll be able to print your own Chanel bangle on a MakerBot device in your home.  For better or worse, creative competition and the occasional design theft — or \"inspiration,\" if you\\'re feeling generous — has always pushed the industry forward. When anyone can steal your designs, your quickest recourse is to keep innovating. Not at all coincidentally, the tech world is built on this very concept. ',\n",
       " ' With the World Series tied 2-2 and headed into a pivotal Game 5 on Monday night, it\\'s time to take a quick look at one of the more prescient Twitter accounts in baseball.  The \"Baseball\\'s Best Fans\" account isn\\'t new, but its clever conceit is more relevant than ever with the St. Louis Cardinals two wins away from a World Series title.  See also: Is this the funniest photo in baseball history? The account\\'s premise is simple. At some point over the past several decades, Cardinals supporters anointed themselves the \"best fans in baseball,\" citing reasons from unwavering loyalty to reverence for the game and respect for opponents. If the Internet has taught us one thing, however, it\\'s that evil lurks in all forms. If the Internet has taught us a second thing, it\\'s that talk is cheap. \"Baseball\\'s Best Fans\" recalls both truisms to poke a little fun at Cardinals supporters\\' surfeit of self-regard by finding the very worst tweets from St. Louis fans. Slurs, epithets, tasteless jokes, death threats — they\\'re all represented. You can visit the @BestFansStLouis Twitter profile for a full dose, but here are just a few milder examples from the past few days:  Deleted MT \"@CoryD315: Boston fan: \"It\\'s a marathon, not a sprint.\" Annnnndddd how\\'d that last Boston Marathon work out for ya? #TooSoon\" — Baseball\\'s Best Fans (@BestFansStLouis) October 28, 2013   Gomes must die.

Probably not. If you scraped the dregs of Twitter for the worst supporters of any other sports team, you would likely turn up similar results.  Does it mean Cardinals fans aren\\'t, in fact, the \"best in baseball,\" as they claim? Perhaps that\\'s true. But most of all, this account is just a timely reminder that even the greatest fan bases have plenty of bad apples — and on social media, those bad apples are more visible than ever.

       " ' Could Sochi turn into a sea of bright red hoodies, scarves, beanies and duffel bags? If so, American Apparel may have pulled off one of the greatest ambush marketing campaigns in Olympics history. The Los Angeles-based brand, which has no official sponsorship ties to the upcoming winter events in Sochi, has launched a line of merchandise based on the Olympic charter’s Principle 6, which states that \"Sport does not discriminate on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise.” See also: 15 Olympic Figure Skaters Whose Faces Might Get Stuck Like This Several activist groups recruited American Apparel and spearheaded the Principle 6 campaign, which has a heavy social media element, to protest Russia’s anti-gay laws. They chose the Olympics’ own charter language in hopes that competing athletes could wear the clothing without running afoul of Russia’s homosexual “propaganda” ban or the Olympics’ rule against political speech. The merchandise, which includes crop tops, jerseys and briefs, launched online in December, and recently landed in American Apparel stores worldwide. The unisex T-shirt emblazoned with the P6 logo is the bestselling new item on the brand’s website, according to creative director Iris Alonzo, and response to the line overall has been “extremely positive.”  While it’s still a somewhat gray area for Olympians, Australian snowboarder Belle Brockhoff plans to wear P6 swag while in Sochi. On-site fans could don the clothes and accessories, unless Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime interprets the move as breaking the law. (Activists don’t think the Russian government would risk the international outrage that would stem from spectators arrested for their outfits.) Consumers who likely won’t be at the games are already responding to the red merchandise, and pro athletes like the NBA’s Steve Nash, former NFL player Chris Kluwe, tennis greats Martina Navratilova and Andy Roddick and Olympic champ Greg Louganis are among the ambassadors for the program. See also: AT&T Is First Olympic Brand to Condemn Russia\\'s Anti-Gay Laws Top-tier brands like Visa, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, General Electric and others have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for their multi-year Olympics sponsorships. But their competitors love to draft off the worldwide exposure of such events, planning stunts, on-site marketing and other promotions to take advantage of the spotlight.  A Global Language Monitor study found that 10 of the top 15 brands associated with the upcoming Olympic Games, including Philips, Starbucks and Pepsi, were not official sponsors. American Apparel, which is donating proceeds of the P6 product to LGBT groups in Russia, is trying to steer clear of that fray. “We simply refer to a sports event and are very clear that this is about raising awareness of an important human rights issue,” Alonzo said. “In no way do we imply endorsement from the Olympic Games.” Due to boycott threats and protests against official Olympic sponsors that haven’t spoken out forcefully against the anti-gay crackdown in Russia, it may be just as well, activists say. “I think American Apparel will see a halo effect for taking a position,” said Andre Banks, executive director and cofounder of All Out. “It’s a great opportunity for them to differentiate themselves and show leadership.” ',\n",
       " '     Leap Motion, the motion controller that lets you interact with a PC or Mac by waving your hands in midair, is rolling out the next generation of its software to developers. The update is aimed at creating a more intuitive user experience and will be the biggest for the platform since the company launched its gesture-based controller last year. See also: 4 Innovative Ways Startups Are Using Leap Motion Leap Motion\\'s controller tracks users\\' hand movements so they can play games, read articles and control basic PC functions without ever touching a screen, keyboard or mouse. But its current software has limitations that make it difficult for developers to take full advantage of the platform, says Michael Buckwald, the company\\'s CEO and cofounder. The current software may lose tracking if a user rotates his hand vertically or intertwines his fingers, for example. But version two will be able to track the individual joints of each finger so it won\\'t lose the position. \"The Leap is the most accurate motion tracking in the world at tracking what it can see,\" Buckwald told Mashable. \"With version two of the tracking, we\\'re able to track what the device can\\'t see.\"  Version 2 of Leap Motion\\'s software will be able to track users\\' hands, no matter what position they are in.Image:  Leap MotionBuckwald says in the beginning, the company focused on encouraging developers to experiment, but now wants to emphasize a more consistent user experience. \"Too many apps today involve just one finger or the whole hand,\" he said. \"The developer should be able to focus on creating a physical experience and not have to think about the finger tracking or the hand tracking.\" Currently, the representation of a person\\'s hand or finger onscreen is different in each app, but Leap wants each developer to eventually add a virtual hand, mirroring the position of the user\\'s hand, into the apps to make the user experience more intuitive. As of Tuesday, the Leap Motion update is only available to developers in a public beta, but it will eventually roll out to consumers after developers have had a chance to optimize their apps for the new software. The company isn\\'t providing that timeline, but Buckwald said the beta will be updated regularly. ',\n",

See also: The Most Connected Man Is You, Just a Few Years From Now At 1.30 p.m. ET, the Lizard Squad took to Twitter to also claim that an American Airlines plane, with Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley on board, was carrying explosives.   .@AmericanAir We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley\\'s plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this. — Lizard Squad (@LizardSquad) August 24, 2014  An hour and a half later, Smedley tweeted that he hated American Airlines just after his plane, which was en route from San Diego to Dallas, was diverted due to \"security issues\" with the cargo. Flight 362 had 179 passengers on board and six crew members when it landed safely in Phoenix just over two hours later.

There has been no confirmation that the two incidents are connected, but a final tweet by Smedley indicates that he believes it was not a coincidence.  Yes. My plane was diverted.

       " ' A top European Union court ruled on Tuesday that consumers can ask Google to remove potentially damaging content about them, also known as the preposterously-named \"right to be forgotten.\"  One problem: It\\'s exactly opposite of the way the Internet should work. See also: Top EU Court Rejects Metadata Collection Law, Cites Privacy Concerns You\\'ve got it all wrong, EU. I say this not as someone who enjoys a level of popularity on the web, but as a regular person who managed to anger a powerful few (at least online). Lance Ulanoff is the smallest midget in the circus. Lance Ulanoff’s death spiral has begun. Lance Ulanoff is an idiot. The words stung and would crop up every single time I Googled myself. The search giant and its powerful index would continually reveal people were saying about me. I could do nothing except hope that newer results would push those old results way, way down. These results — actually headlines for entire articles — appeared years ago, in response to critical posts I wrote about social media and other technology. Back then, I was writing roughly one post a week, and while most were simply ruminations on the state of technology, some were biting takedowns of nonsense, tech hypocrisy and simply bad digital ideas. Sometimes they were wrong, but that happens when you write opinion pieces. In any case, some people didn’t like what I’d written. So as is their right, they wrote opposing opinion posts, but with headlines designed for maximum Ulanoff Takedown. In some cases, they were more popular than my original posts — and, thanks to Google’s search index, the more people linked to those posts, the higher they appeared in search results for my name. This makes sense; links are a signal of validity, and these stinging words were as valid as anything else about me online. It was also, of course, a personal embarrassment to me. I wondered what I could do. The European Court of Justice is now proposing a solution for this kind of problem: Force Google to expunge links from its index so people can\\'t find the damaging information. In other words, if someone calls you a putz, you could petition Google to have the links with those disses removed from its search results. This wouldn\\'t get rid of the original post, which sits on another site on another server — it would just make it hard to find on Google. (I guess someone could still find it on Bing, though; the EU might want to look into that.) This would only take effect in Europe, so the insulting links would still be accessible through Google to anyone outside the EU. So you’re a putz in the U.S., but in London, you’re a grand old chap. The EU’s action is such a fundamental misunderstanding of the web and digital record-keeping that it boggles the mind. Google\\'s job is not to police the Internet for negative comments or even dangerous information; that\\'s like saying a library can\\'t have books about Nazis or murder (or any less-than-praiseworthy biographies of Frank Sinatra).  The EU’s decision is not just a slippery slope. It’s a cliff. It\\'s supposed to apply to content about average people, but what defines \"average\"? I fully expect people with even a marginal public profile and small businesses to use this precedent to try to protect themselves. Will all consumer review sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor and Amazon now have to worry about the EU enforcing the removal of negative product and service reviews? I know some sites try to watch for astro-turfing and coordinated product and services takedowns. But one-off reviews — good or bad — are the heart and soul of these sites. Who’s to say what stays in a search index and what goes? If Google complies with this new rule (and they\\'re sure to put up a fight), how does it explain to the host sites that portions of their content are being hidden from search? Will it have a chance to appeal? What if actors or film directors try to hide bad reviews of their work — will the EU be the judge and jury for it all? I love that this rule is part of a \"right to be forgotten\" movement. You want to be forgotten online? Don’t post anything you’ll later regret. If you want to control what other people say about you online, good luck. Everything on the Internet will exist long after you’re dead. It’s how future generations will learn about society in the 21st century, the start of the first fully-digital millennium. So please, EU and everyone who supports this ruling, get over yourselves.  In my case, I found a simple way to “hide” the negative comments about me: Just keep working. I wrote more and more posts, and soon, the good comments and responses far outweighed the bad. You can still find some of the negative stuff, but it’s mostly buried digital miles deep under a mountain of reasonable online response. ',\n",
       " ' Jaden and Willow Smith, the famous children of famous people Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, were interviewed by T Magazine on a slew of wide-ranging topics, including Prana energy, time itself and Final Cut Pro.  It is 2014. What a time to be alive. See also: 20 Weird GIFs That Belong in Another Dimension The immeasurably bizarre interview solidifies the young Smiths\\' status as the nation\\'s deepest-thinking sibling celebrities. Honestly, it\\'s difficult to describe how insane this interview is without reading it, so we suggest doing that. But if you\\'re just looking for the highlights, we\\'ve compiled our favorite moments below. Keep in mind that Willow Smith is 14 and Jaden Smith is 16. That means neither was alive when Titanic was released. 1. Willow Smith on the concept of time. WILLOW: I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please, and that’s how I know it doesn’t exist. 2. Willow and Jaden on why they create.  JADEN: Honestly, we’re just trying to make music that we think is cool. We don’t think a lot of the music out there is that cool. So we make our own music. We don’t have any song that we like to listen to on the P.C.H. by any other artist, you know? WILLOW: That’s what I do with novels. There’re no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it’s the best thing. JADEN: Willow’s been writing her own novels since she was 6.  3. Willow and Jaden on kids who go to \"normal school.\"  JADEN: Kids who go to normal school are so teenagery, so angsty. WILLOW: They never want to do anything, they’re so tired.  4. Willow and Jaden on not caring about things.  JADEN: Willow just dropped a song (“Cares”), let me quote the lyrics: “I do not care what people say.” We both don’t really care. I like to wear things that I make, but I throw it on as though I was throwing on anything. It looks cool, sometimes. WILLOW: I like to go to places with my high-fashion things where there are a lot of cameras. So I can just go there and be like, “Yep, yep, I’m looking so sick.”  5. Jaden on \"the things worth having.\" JADEN: Something that’s worth buying to me is like Final Cut Pro or Logic. 6. Jaden on happiness and apples JADEN: When you’re thinking about something happy, you’re thinking about something sad. When you think about an apple, you also think about the opposite of an apple. It’s a tool for understanding mathematics and things with two separate realities. But for creativity: That comes from a place of oneness. That’s not a duality consciousness.  While we aren\\'t sure why these questions were posed in the first place, or how this interview even happened, it\\'s still interesting to wake up one day and realize that the star of Men in Black gave birth to children with the spirit of a Gary Busey/Rust Cohle hybrid.

       " ' The latest airport security measures put in place by U.S. officials — who are concerned that al-Qaeda in Yemen is trying to develop a bomb that could go undetected during passenger screening — are again putting a spotlight on a notorious Yemeni bomb maker who has evaded capture after several high-profile terror attempts. American officials announced on Monday that passengers traveling on U.S.-bound flights from a dozen foreign airports will be required to prove their smartphones have power, or risk having them confiscated before they are able to board the plane. See also: Iraq Implodes: What You Need to Know The rules may extend to laptops and tablets as well. There is no indication that such a \"smartphone bomb\" has been created or that there\\'s a specific threat to the U.S., but the Obama administration last week had called for tighter security measures at foreign airports that have direct flights to the United States. The mastermind whose name keeps coming up In recent years, a Yemeni bomb maker named Ibrahim Hassan Al-Asiri has eluded the authorities while developing a series of new and increasingly fearsome bombs that can be smuggled onto airliners.  He was rumored to have been killed in an April attack by U.S. special forces, but forensic tests later revealed he escaped. We don\\'t know if Al-Asiri is behind the latest threat, but the Yemeni terrorist has been hard at work creating a bomb that can slip through airport security, and so his name has surfaced in reports around the latest terror threat.  In recent weeks he swore allegiance to ISIL — the militant group sweeping through Syria and Iraq. A history of bombing attempts Al-Asiri\\'s brother was killed in 2009 when explosives packed into his rectum detonated in a failed assassination attempt on the head of Saudi intelligence. Al-Asiri was responsible for the bomb that a Nigerian would-be terrorist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, wore in his underwear on a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas in 2009. Abdulmutallab was subdued by his fellow passengers while attempting to light a fuse while flying over Detroit and was arrested when his flight landed. He\\'s since been sentenced to life in prison.   Explosives packed into printer cartridges were discovered on a UPS plane in November 2010, mere hours before they were set to detonate. They were timed to explode as the plane was flying over the U.S., but were found by Scotland Yard before the plane took off. The bombs contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, and are believed to have been made by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) at the hands of Al-Asiri — investigators even found his fingerprints on the devices.  Yemen: FBI finds fingerprints of Al-Qaida bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri on bombs used by Nigerian underwear bomber and parcel bombs — Florian Flade (@FlorianFlade) May 24, 2011  Officials in 2012 stopped another would-be suicide bomber wearing one of Al-Asiri\\'s underwear bombs — an upgraded version that was \"similar to IEDs that have been used previously by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in attempted terrorist attacks,\" officials said. Al-Asiri, believed to be in his 30s, has reportedly taught a number of acquaintances, apprentices and protégés his tradecraft in the event he is captured or killed.

       " \" Sorry, singles with Android, BlackBerry, Windows or old-school cellphones. Your iPhone-toting compatriots are getting more first date action than you, according to a recent survey of singledom. The survey, conducted by Match.com, drew on singles both in and outside its service. Some 5,000 non-married men and women in the U.S. were asked more than 200 questions, including whether they had been on one or more first dates in the last year. None were in a serious relationship. The results, broken down by type of smartphone, look like this: 49% of iPhone singles went on at least one first date in 2012. Next up were Windows Phone users, 46% of whom had first-dated; for Android users, it was 44%. BlackBerry owners were the least likely to have been on a first date that year; only 42% of them had done it.  You've no doubt noted that more than half of each singles group, including 51% of iPhone owners, aren't going on first dates. Does this mean they're too busy with their noses buried in their smartphones to interact with new people?  Not likely: just 27% of old-school feature phone owners went on a first date in 2012. And among singles who don't carry a phone at all, the number was a mere 18%.  So does owning an iPhone actually make you more outgoing? Or is it merely a function of this sad socio-economic truth: wealthier people are more likely to attract partners, and also more likely to shell out for iPhones?

       " ' Amid the crumbling row houses in once-industrial Camden, New Jersey, murals are dedicated to the fallen, hundreds more lost in one of America\\'s deadliest cities. One is dedicated to a veteran who survived his deployment in Iraq unscathed, only to be shot and killed in his hometown. \"This is not a war you can win in one day,\" one Camden police officer said. \"This is not a war where you can go and get rid of the bad guys and say, ‘OK guys, here\\'s your city back.\\' \"We have to occupy this city forever.\" Homicides are down across most of the country, but little has changed in Camden. Parents are still losing their children at an alarming rate. Over 40% of all victims of firearm-related homicides are 25 or younger. In Camden, the typical victim is just 22. A News21 analysis of the FBI\\'s national database of supplementary homicide reports found that across the country, 17,422 black men between ages 13 and 30 have been killed by firearms since 2008.  Every other week, the mothers of Camden meet at Virtua hospital, where they come to talk about the dead. They cluster around a table, where the windows behind them frame an American flag flying in front of the towering oxidized copper spires of a historic Catholic church. Each one raised children in the city; each one lost children to the city. \"I don\\'t think I can really ever ‘get over\\' losing my son,\" says one of the women. \"They told me to go to counseling, but those psychiatrists haven\\'t gone what I\\'ve gone through.\" Cheri Burks started the support group, United Mothers Stand, after her son was shot and killed on Mother\\'s Day last year. He was 24 years old. \"Nobody here has money,\" Christina \"Goosie\" Carstarphen said. \"Nobody has a bank account, nobody has homes, nobody has a business.\" Carstarphen saw her son, Robert, lying in an alley after he was shot and killed in 2012. \"For him to be gunned down like he was, in an alleyway, like a dog, that wasn\\'t right,\" she said. \"I couldn\\'t even cry, I was so angry. It was just like, something just ripped out of my body, like a part of me just went.\" After her son\\'s death, she installed blackout blinds throughout her apartment. She wanted to grieve in the dark. \"I lost my job and everything when my son died,\" Carstarphen said. \"I didn\\'t want to leave the house. I shut myself down.\" Camden is a community that has been wrecked by gun violence. In 2012, the small city — only nine square miles with a population of 77,000 — had a murder rate that was 17 times higher than the national murder rate. Since then, the number of murders has fallen, down from 65 in 2012 to 58 in 2013 and 19 so far in 2014, according to statistics from the Camden County Police Department. Despite the falling homicide rate, the problems plaguing Camden and spurring violent crime are numerous. Police Chief Scott Thomson calls the city \"the perfect storm of social inequities.\" Its streets are deteriorating. There are no supermarkets, and restaurants are hard to find. It is one of the poorest cities in the United States with a per capita income of around $13,000, and there are few job opportunities. One factor contributing to the killings is the proliferation of illegal firearms. About eight out of 10 guns the police confiscate are from out of state, Thomson said, coming from Pennsylvania and Maryland, both of which have more relaxed gun laws than New Jersey. Frequently, they end up in the hands of Camden\\'s youth. Former Camden County Prosecutor Diane Marano said young men in Camden carry guns for protection after they start working on the streets. Marano, who wrote a doctoral thesis on juvenile gun acquisition, interviewed many jailed youth from southern New Jersey. In an environment of acute economic deprivation, a gun was \"a key to anything you want to do,\" one teen told her. Thomson says that with so many guns accessible, they\\'re commonly used to resolve street-corner disputes. Camden County Police — successors to the Camden Police Department, which was disbanded in 2012 after the city ran out of money to pay for its own force — has taken on a more prominent role in the community since its was formed in 2013, increasing foot patrols and installing additional surveillance cameras. Thomson said the heightened police presence seems to be helping, with murders down by 35% so far this year. Nevertheless, many Camden residents say they do not feel any safer. People are still reluctant to venture far beyond their \"‘hoods\" — there\\'s still a feeling that safety is only possible if you stay within a stone\\'s throw of your own house. Thomson concedes that the police will never be able to solve every problem the city is facing. \"We got a gun and we got a pair of handcuffs,\" he said. \"The pistol and the bracelets aren\\'t going to fix the problems of our city, and we try to use those as tools of last resort.\" The first line of defense is the community.

Dillard said he wanted to do something good for the community after spending 10 years in prison for drugs and firearms possession.  Image: Erin Patrick OConnor/News21      Hamzah Hamid is a fixture on Haddon Avenue. Shouts of \"Assalamu Alaikum\" typical of this heavily Muslim community greet him. He\\'s a religious man; a prayer bump on his forehead from his daily devotions proves the intensity with which he practices his faith. He feels it\\'s his destiny to stay in Camden, to keep kids from going down the same path he did: Hamid served three years in prison for selling drugs. Hamid is one of the cofounders of Rising Leaders, an outreach group trying to create positive opportunities for at-risk youth. He talks to kids in Camden about everything from job readiness and budgeting to healthy eating. He wants them to have goals, to plan for a future many have trouble imagining. \"We\\'re just trying to show these young bulls that they can do something else with their lives besides dealing drugs and gang-banging,\" Hamid said. He says the young people he works with turn to crime because they\\'re frustrated and alone. They have no place to go, and no positive role models. Part of Hamid\\'s work is simple: Give the kids something to do besides run the streets. On the bottom floor of his house, Hamid offers drop-in karate courses and lets neighborhood kids play videogames. \"If there were two or three more people like Hamid in Camden,\" said Dexter Hart, Hamid\\'s father-in-law, \"the city would be a lot better off.\" A few blocks north of Rising Leaders\\' makeshift headquarters, a Jesuit priest is fighting the same battle. The Rev. Jeff Putthoff is the founder and executive director of HopeWorks N\\' Camden, a group that focuses on helping youths who come from unstable housing situations. The program offers temporary housing and helps young men and women get jobs and GED certificates. The cornerstone of the program, however, focuses on the youths\\' pasts. HopeWorks provides counseling, employing a form of treatment called trauma-informed care that looks at the impact trauma has had on the lives of youths in the program. \"The people living in Camden, especially the youths, have been exposed to so much stress in their lives due to the poverty they\\'ve grown up in and the violence all around them,\" Putthoff said. \"This hurts them when they try to get and hold a job.\" Puthoff says that many young people turn to drugs to alleviate the distress caused by trauma. \"I see a future of healing, but a future that requires a lot of work,\" he said. \"Healing takes work, healing is sweaty. Hope is sweaty.\" A few years ago, Pyne Poynt Park in North Camden was a notorious open-air drug market, littered with needles. But in 2011, Bryan Morton founded the North Camden Little League, remaking the park as one of the only places offering recreational activities to the city\\'s youth. Now, he says, summer is the best season in Camden. \"Everybody is out, everybody is connected,\" Morton said. \"Nobody wants to leave the park, nobody wants to go home, everybody wants another at bat.\" He says he founded the baseball league to give fathers the chance to be fathers, mothers a time to relax, kids the opportunity to be kids and to let everyone forget for a moment that they live in the most dangerous city in America. He loves the view from the baseball field. \"The sun\\'s setting, the back channel of the Delaware, light breeze blowing through the trees, kids and coaches. Parents looking on. That\\'s all-American,\" Morton said. \"This is reminding us of our place in this society, and it\\'s reminding the society that we are here.\" And that they want their children to live. This report is part of a project titled \"Gun Wars: The Struggle Over Rights and Regulation in America,\" produced by the Carnegie-Knight News21 initiative, a national investigative reporting project involving top college journalism students across the country and headquartered at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.

       " ' Smart glasses like Google Glass can be extremely useful for many jobs. Doctors, repairmen, even firemen — wherever there\\'s a profession that sometimes requires crucial information without sitting at a desk or holding a tablet, wearable technology is up to the task. Problems arise, however: How, exactly, does one operate Google Glass\\'s touchpad if the job involves heavy work gloves? And what if the ambient noise makes voice control impossible? See also: The Inevitable Path of Google Glass in the Workplace Here\\'s where other wearable technology can come into play — specifically the Myo armband, which can control things via gesture, similar to Microsoft Kinect or Leap Motion. As long as the Myo and the smart glasses have the right software, the two can interact seamlessly. Thalmic Labs, creator of the Myo, is taking a step forward on Tuesday to make sure those experiences get built. It\\'s partnering with several companies — including APX Labs, Augmedix, Recon Instruments and Bridgit — all of which make either software (and sometimes hardware) for smart glasses. \"We\\'re focused on delivering solutions for people in field service, manufacturing or logistics — whenever someone\\'s fixing, building or moving something,\" Brian Ballard, CEO of APX Labs, told Mashable. \"You could even rotate your hand to rotate a virtual object. Some of these solutions we expect to deliver into customers\\' hands almost immediately.\" Is mixing smart glasses with a gesture controller the ultimate wearable combo? Gesture control can often be awkward when performing basic controls on a PC, but with a wearable it has the potential too be much more natural. Not to mention portable. \"The user could be out in the middle of the field,\" says Scott Greenberg, director of developer relations for Thalmic Labs. \"They can be anywhere. This opens up a lot of possibilities — from different lighting conditions to different spaces.\" Enhanced with wearable tech, the workplace of the future could stay connected no matter the circumstances. Of course, it depends upon the right applications getting built, but — as today\\'s announcement implies — the greatest opportunities for developers may lie in the enterprise space.  ',\n",
       " ' Nearly 30 people are dead with hundreds still missing after a ferry listed and sank off the southern coast of South Korea on Wednesday.  While the cause has yet to be identified, the captain of the ship has been arrested, Yonhap news agency reports, and faces charges that include negligence of duty and violation of maritime law. See also: 4 Dead, Hundreds Missing After Ferry Sinks Off South Korean Coast As the world awaits answers about the fate of the missing passengers, many of them high school students whose parents are growing increasingly frustrated back on shore, it appears a litany of mistakes may have led up this moment. Below, we track what may have gone wrong. A sharp turn Investigators are looking into the possibility that a sharp turn caused unsecured cargo and vehicles to shift. This, it is believed, may have caused the ship to list — and then sink as water poured on board.  South Korea\\'s maritime police chief said the ship may have deviated from its planned route, but investigators do not yet know why. Some are speculating that after a two-hour delay due to fog, crew members may have attempted to make up time by going off course. This, then, may have led to an unintentional grounding of the ship on land in the waters off the coast of South Korea.  Survivors who were interviewed after the ferry sunk said they had heard a “crash and scraping noise”, others reported having heard it crash into something, suggesting the ferry may have hit rocks. Third officer at the helm The ship\\'s third officer was at the helm at the time the ship began to list, an investigating prosecutor told Reuters. \"He may have been off the bridge ... and the person at the helm at the time was the third officer,\" the investigator said. The 26-year-old third mate had just one year\\'s experience. \"Although surviving crew members have given different accounts about the situation, we are investigating the captain as he is suspected of leaving the steering room for an unknown reason,\" the official said. Captain first to abandon ship Lee Joon-seok, center, the captain of the sunken ferry Sewol in the water off the southern coast, arrives at a court which issues his arrest warrant in Mokpo, south of Seoul, South Korea, Friday, April 18, 2014.Image: Yonhap/Associated Press The captain of the sunken ferry was one of the first to abandon ship, Coast Guard officials said. Now, he\\'s facing criminal charges for the incident that\\'s left nearly 30 people dead and hundreds missing. “I am really sorry and deeply ashamed,” Lee Joon-seok, 69, said on South Korean television. \"I don\\'t know what to say.\" The captain of the ferry allegedly escaped in a lifeboat alongside other crew members, leaving the passengers on board to fend for themselves as the ship sunk beneath the water. A South Korean newspaper speculated that the captain, Lee Joon-seok, could possibly be in violation of the Seafarers’ Act, which states, \"A captain shall not leave his/her ship from the time cargoes are loaded or passengers start to go on board until the time all cargoes are unloaded or all passengers leave his/her ship. At times when a ship is in critical danger, a captain shall take all measures necessary to rescue human lives, the ship and cargoes.” Passengers told to stay put While the captain and his crew reportedly fled the ship, hundreds of passengers were being told to stay put. Crew member Oh Yong-seok told the Associated Press that passengers were told to put on life jackets as the ship began to list. For the next 50 minutes, passengers were repeatedly told to stay in place, even as the ship continued to list and water began pouring into the ship\\'s hull.  At that point, crew members say, the captain ordered an evacuation. But it\\'s not clear if the message ever reached any of the 475 passengers on board. “It was so hectic in the ship that I couldn’t even think to make any judgment,” said Kang Hye-sung, 31, a crew member who used a walkie-talkie to tell students to stay put even as objects were “rolling all over,\" The Washington Post reported. Survivors\\' videos taken from within the ship show the passengers huddled and wearing life jackets. An announcement can be heard telling them to stay put. “There was an announcement telling us to sit still, but the ferry was already sinking. Some of the students were not able to escape,\" one witness told the BBC. \"Don\\'t move,\" a voice can be heard saying according to one recording that\\'s aired on South Korea TV. \"If you move, it\\'s dangerous. Don\\'t move.\"  “When the vessel tilted, I dashed over to the wheelhouse, and the captain was leaning against the door repeatedly telling people to wait over the loudspeaker,” said Oh Yong-seok.  No evacuation drill and a lack of life boats Kang Hae-seong, the ferry\\'s communications officer who is said to have issued the orders for passengers to stay put, told reporters that he could not remember ever having done an evacuation drill  as the ferry left its port. As the crisis on board the ship became more serious, Kang told The New York Times, “I repeatedly told people to calm themselves and stay where they were for an hour.\" But more shockingly: \"I did not have time to look at a manual for evacuation”. Survivor Kim Su-bin, 16, survived by climbing out of the sinking ship and jumping into the water, The Times reported . “I don’t remember that there was any safety instruction before we boarded the ship,” she said. The Sewol reportedly passed its safety test just two months ago. There were 46 life boats on board the vessel, but only two of them were used in the evacuation. Lack of life vests on in the cafeteria “Life jackets were on the fourth floor where the sleeping cabins were, but those who were on the third floor at the time had no life jackets,\" said Kim Su-bin to The Times. While there were 1,000 life vests on board the vessel, students in the cafeteria allegedly could not reach them. ',\n",
       " ' You can\\'t see it, but one in every 500 Americans has it. It makes them anxious, obsessive and often unable to pick up social cues. It\\'s Asperger\\'s syndrome.  Asperger\\'s is a disorder on the autism spectrum. It gets its name from Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who first observed the condition in a group of children in 1944. Common characteristics include poor social skills, anxiety, average to above average intelligence and an intense focus on facts or hobbies, coupled with a penchant for rigidity and aversion to change. But in today\\'s pop culture, Asperger\\'s cues make for ripe entertainment opportunities. See also: 5 Autism Simulations to Help You Experience Sensory Overload Asperger\\'s on the screen In episode three of the new HBO series, Silicon Valley, the main character, nerdy programmer Richard Hendriks, gets sized up by a bullish man. \"You remind me of my son. He\\'s got Asperger\\'s, too,\" he says to Hendriks, who waffles nebbishly, stammering as he tries to explain his way out of the diagnosis.  \"[The show] is like Asperger\\'s Entourage,\" actor T.J. Miller, who plays the character Erlich on the show, previously told Mashable.  There\\'s that word again. More and more, the term is becoming a go-to tick, a signal that a character will fall into certain characteristics: intelligent, quirky, awkward. \"Part of what seems to be happening with Asperger\\'s now is that it’s almost becoming shorthand, kind of the way OCD has,\" Erika Drezner, a coordinator for the Asperger\\'s Association of New England, tells Mashable. \"It means they’re nerdy and smart and not very socially gifted.\" Drezner is running a pop culture-themed workshop at an upcoming AANE conference, and is mother to a child with Asperger\\'s. However, those with the syndrome vary greatly. They aren\\'t all geniuses with social skills problems on the side. Far from it. According to Pat Schissel, executive director and president of the board of the Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism Association, only about 12% of the Asperger\\'s community is \"gifted\" in that sense. Thus far, none of the main characters on Silicon Valley have actually said they have Asperger\\'s. It\\'s not the first time TV characters have outwardly displayed \"common traits\" of the syndrome, without actually owning the disorder. The Big Bang Theory, Community, The Middle and Bones are among the hush-hush crowd. The characters tap close to home, but never quite go there. In The Middle, it\\'s suggested that the character Brick is on the autism spectrum by a teacher who says he is \"a quirky child...maybe clinically quirky, even.\"  However, just because the condition goes unnamed doesn\\'t mean the Asperger\\'s community is blind to the references. But does it hurt the public\\'s impression of the disorder, equally? Keeping it quiet Sheldon (Jim Parsons) sits at his computer in a scene from \\'The Big Bang Theory.\\'Image: CBS Michael Yarish/Warner Bros. Entertainment IncReasons vary for the autism spectrum silence in Hollywood. Community creator Dan Harmon says it didn\\'t occur to him that the character Abed might have Asperger\\'s, until fans of the show started pointing it out. Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady has said the character Sheldon was based on someone he used to know, though the actor who plays Sheldon, Jim Parsons, has admitted, \"I can say that he couldn\\'t display more facets of it.\"  Plenty of YouTube clips exist, purely to document Sheldon\\'s Asperger\\'s-like behavior.  Now that Sheldon has been pegged by the autism community, the writers squirrel even farther away from labeling the character. It would mean added responsibility to straddle the fine line between mockery and mirth. Definitively labeling a character with Asperger\\'s requires a new layer of sensitivity. Silicon Valley is an especially loaded example, given pop culture\\'s inclination to connect Asperger\\'s with tech geeks. Take Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed misfit heroine of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film series. She has remarkable intelligence, photographic memory and a penchant for computer hacking. Though author Stieg Larsson never explicitly writes that Lisbeth has the disorder, he communicates the possibility via thoughts from other characters, like protagonist Michael Blomkvist, who surmises she must have the syndrome.   Then there\\'s The Social Network, the 2010 flick about the founding of Facebook. It paints Mark Zuckerberg as a narcissistic aspie. Though the character is, again, never labeled with the disorder (and the real Zuckerberg has never made any indication he has it), film reviews and autism sites were quick to point out the character\\'s intense similarities, established from the film\\'s opening scene, where Zuckerberg displays his poor social skills.  \"I think the whole character portrayal of the Zuckerberg movie is a perfect example of people who think, ‘Oh well, Asperger\\'s, they’re just arrogant and they want to be left alone and they’re weird and that’s it,\\'\" says Christian Tsetsos, mentor and administrative assistant at Behavioral Concepts. \"I think that a lot of us, especially me before I was socially competent, want so bad to connect — we just don’t know how.\" Tsetsos, 25, was diagnosed with Asperger\\'s when he was five years old. He describes his early years with the disorder as \"horrendous\" and anxiety-inducing, though he says he now has a better grasp on it.  \"I lived socially isolated from the time I was 12 to 20. Basically, I would go to school, I’d come home and that was my life,\" Tsetsos says. \"At 20 years old, I was wondering what it would be like to have a friend, so at work I decided to challenge myself to try to connect with the others.\" He now considers himself socially aware, but what he sees on screen doesn\\'t mirror his own experiences with Asperger\\'s, he says. \"I think pop culture tends to focus on the more impaired, bizarre acting,\" he says, citing examples like the titular character of Adam, the 2009 film about a lonely man with a textbook definition of Asperger\\'s. In the comedy world, the unusual (especially if it\\'s particularly bizarre) is welcomed with open arms. The more extreme aspects of Asperger\\'s translate into wild onscreen antics, so long as the disorder itself remains unnamed.  When it is named, it can tread dangerous waters. Season three of the hybrid musical dramedy Glee introduces a character named Sugar Motta. She quickly parades into rooms, making rude and socially unaware comments, but it\\'s \"okay\" because she has \"self-diagnosed Asperger\\'s.\" The show faced backlash around the trope-y character.  Would critics direct the same negative reaction at Sheldon, if his character was labeled as openly?  Asperger\\'s, so long as it\\'s unnamed, is an easy plot excuse to make characters perform quirky or bizarre acts, due to the disorder\\'s wide-ranging behavioral traits.  Show writers who purposely don\\'t give their characters disorders get away with most anything. Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory behaves strangely because he\\'s just \"Sheldon-y,\" not because he\\'s someone with a disorder. \"I think there’s a general misunderstanding of how debilitating [Asperger\\'s] can really be,\" Drezner says. “I think the danger is when people sort of get one idea in their head and get kind of attached to it and say, \\'This is what the condition is — it’s Sheldon.\\'\" The aim for realism Fictional works like Parenthood have aimed to portray Asperger\\'s seriously. The NBC dramedy stars a large family, featuring a character named Max, who is diagnosed with Asperger\\'s at a very young age. It comes from a personal place: The show\\'s creator and executive producer Jason Katims has a son with the syndrome. The personal touch has made fans out of people in the community, such as Schissel and Drezner, who both name it one of their favorite portrayals of Asperger\\'s.  “I feel like it can be comforting to see representations of your experience on TV,\" Drezner says. \"I think it\\'s normal.\"  Along with Parenthood, Schissel and Drezner also commend The Middle. However, Tsetsos says he sees more of himself in introverted characters like Angela Chase of the short-lived series My So-Called Life (though she doesn\\'t have Asperger\\'s).  \"She’s not supposed to have a disorder, but I feel like a lot of us with Asperger\\'s were kind of like that,\" Tsetsos says. \"We look normal, but we’re just with our own struggles.\" At the end of the day, it\\'s more about how those with Asperger\\'s can relate to the characters, regardless whether the disorder is explicitly there. For Tsetsos, it\\'s more important that the public educates themselves, and not simply rely on the limitations of Hollywood.  ',\n",

       " ' When the 2014-2015 NBA season tips off this fall, the league\\'s official game ball will still be that familiar orange-brown hue. It will still be made by Spalding and will still have the same feel as last year.  See also: The Basketball World Cup: Who Team USA Should Bring to Spain But the ball will come with one change — a minor one, but one that speaks volumes to how heavily the NBA has adopted and benefitted from social media in recent years.  The NBA announced that it will imprint its social media handle — @NBA on all major networks — on official game balls, proclaiming the move a pro sports first.   The NBA\\'s official game ball will feature its social media handle for the first time. Image:  NBAIt may not seem like a huge deal, but the NBA\\'s new marketing twist does signify the increasingly intertwined digital and physical segments of the pro sports world. It\\'s also appropriate for a league that has found success on social media like few, if any, of its peers.  \"First and foremost, it\\'s really about acknowledging our social media-savvy fans,\" Melissa Rosenthal Brenner, the NBA\\'s senior vice president of digital media, told Mashable via email. \"The ball is the instantly-recognizable symbol of our game, and now our fans have a place there too, where they belong.\"             The NBA claims 660 million social media followers, rolling together league, team and player accounts across networks and countries. The league says its official @NBA accounts have 25 million Facebook fans, nearly 11 million Twitter followers, over 3 million Instagram followers and 72 million total followers on Chinese social networks.  LeBron James, not surprisingly, is the league\\'s most popular player online. With more than 20 million Facebook fans, 13 million Twitter followers and 6 million Instagram followers, he outpaces the league on the latter two social networks.  So how did the league and its players amass such a massive social following?  \"It\\'s probably a combination of things,\" Brenner told Mashable. \"First, it is our tech-savvy and prolific players; second, we work very hard to provide our young and passionate fans with all the information, stats and highlights they tell us they want; and third, it is our leadership — starting with our commissioner Adam Silver — that encourages us to use new tools in order to continually enhance the fan experience.\" Those millions upon millions of fans will be represented in NBA games starting this fall. Social media handles have become ubiquitous in arenas and stadiums in every sport, but don\\'t be surprised to see more leagues follow the NBA\\'s lead and stamp them on actual game balls in the future.    15 YouTube Videos of NBA Stars Dominating in High School        1. Derrick Rose  The Chicago Bulls point guard starred at the Windy City\\'s Simeon Career Academy in high school before playing one season of college ball then getting picked first overall by his hometown pro team in the 2008 NBA Draft. He was league MVP in 2011, and is currently on the road to recovery from a serious knee injury. As a high schooler, he was the top-ranked player in the country. This video, which has over 2.6 million YouTube views, makes it easy to understand why.           2. Vince Carter Before becoming the rather husky swingman you see in Dallas today, Carter was known as \"Air Canada\" for his high-flying exploits as a Toronto Raptor. Before that, he starred at the University of North Carolina. Before that, he dunked all over helpless youngsters as a Florida high school legend.            3. James Harden The Oklahoma City Thunder guard is known as much for his epic beard as smooth game today. But just a few years ago, he was a baby-faced prep star leading Artesia High School to back-to-back California state championships.           4. LeBron James This Ohio news report on a local high school sophomore by the name of LeBron James is priceless today. From coaches speculating that he might make the NBA one day, to his earnest interviews, it\\'s amazing to compare this with the global icon we know today. Newsman Brad Forster, who you see in the clip, uploaded it to his personal YouTube channel in 2010.           5. John Wall Wall starred at the University of Kentucky for one season before becoming the first overall pick of the 2010 NBA Draft. This compilation is from his senior year of high school at Word of God Christian Academy in Raleigh, North Carolina, is pretty freaking sweet and has 6.8 million views on YouTube.          6. Jason Kidd What makes this highlight reel even more impressive? It all comes from one game, when Kidd led St. Joseph\\'s High School from Alameda, California, to the 1992 state championship. He then went on to star at Cal and is currently wrapping up his Hall of Fame career with the New York Knicks.          7. Brandon Jennings Jennings is a budding star for the Milwaukee Bucks. This video, which has more than 1.3 million YouTube views, shows him as a high schooler dominating for Oak Hill Academy and in various club team tournaments.           8. Kyrie Irving  After being this awesome in high school, Irving played one year at Duke, became the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, then won the league\\'s Rookie of the Year award in 2012. This video of his high school exploits has earned more than 1.5 million YouTube views.           9. Anthony Davis Davis, the first overall pick of the June\\'s draft, is being counted on to help lead the New Orleans Hornets back to respectability. This is him destroying all comers during his senior year at Chicago\\'s Perspectives Charter School way back in 2010 and 2011.           10. Austin Rivers Davis will be joined in New Orleans by Rivers, another highly touted rookie. He\\'s the son of Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, and is seen here killing it at Winter Park High School in Florida as a senior in 2010 and 2011. The impressive mix has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube.          11. Damian Lillard Who\\'s that, you ask? Lillard, the sixth overall pick of June\\'s NBA Draft, is a trendy pick among many analysts to take home the Rookie of the Year award this year. This is him back at Oakland High School in the Bay Area of California.           12. Rajon Rondo So Rondo\\'s been doing that fake behind-the-back move forever! This is the current Celtics star during his final year of high school ball, in 2004 at national basketball power Oak Hill Academy.           13. Josh Smith Rondo was joined at Oak Hill that season by current Atlanta Hawks star Josh Smith. Now that\\'s what\\'s called an unfair advantage.           14. Carmelo Anthony A couple years before that, current New York Knick Carmelo Anthony played for Oak Hill and, yeah, he was pretty good and dunked a lot, too.           15. Amar\\'e Stoudemire And here\\'s Anthony\\'s current Knicks teammate Stoudemire completely taking a bunch of high schoolers to well, school, as a prep in Orlando, Florida. All these dunks and blocks, from just four games. What are you supposed to do against a kid like that?       ',\n",
       " ' The moon will block the sun in the first solar eclipse of the year on April 29, and stargazers in Australia have some of the best seats on the planet. But you don\\'t have to be in the land Down Under to see the sun spectacle — you can watch it online for free. Weather permitting, the first solar eclipse of 2014 will appear as a partial solar eclipse to observers in Australia and southern Indonesia, with nearly 65 percent of the sun\\'s disk obscured by the moon. It is the first of two solar eclipses this year and comes just two weeks after a dazzling total lunar eclipse on April 15. Two online skywatching groups — the Slooh community telescope and the Virtual Telescope Project — will provide live webcasts of the solar eclipse\\xa0from Australia, beginning at 2 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. You can watch those solar eclipse webcasts live on Space.com. It will be Tuesday afternoon local time across Australia during the eclipse, with the sun setting before the event concludes. Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, as seen from the surface of the Earth, and blocks part or all of the sun\\'s disk. When the moon and sun align perfectly, a total solar eclipse occurs. Because the moon\\'s orbit around Earth is tilted, the moon and sun don\\'t align in an eclipse every month. SEE ALSO: Solar Eclipse of April 29, 2014: Visibility Maps Tuesday\\'s solar eclipse will be what scientists call an annular solar eclipse. The event, also known as a \"ring of fire\" solar eclipse, occurs when the sun is too far from Earth to completely obscure the sun\\'s disk. The result is a bright ring of sunlight around the moon\\'s silhouette, as viewed from the Earth\\'s surface. But on Tuesday, the potentially dazzling \"ring of fire\" eclipse\\xa0will only be visible from one uninhabited spot in Antarctica, where the only audience may be penguins on the frigid landscape. \"This is a thoroughly bizarre eclipse,\" Slooh astronomer Bob Berman said in a statement. \"When Slooh brings its live feeds from Australia, and we watch in real time as the inky black hemisphere of the moon partially obscures the sun, the greatest thrill might be an awareness of what\\'s occurring — unseen by any human — in a tiny region of Antarctica.\" The April 29 solar eclipse will begin at 1:15 p.m. local time in Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and end at 3:59 p.m. local time. The time of greatest eclipse occurs at 2:41 p.m., when the moon will obscure about 65 percent of the solar disk. The event will begin later in the day for observers in Melbourne (3:58 p.m. local time) and Sydney (4:13 p.m.), with the sun setting before the eclipse ends. French amateur astronomer Xavier Jubier created an interactive\\xa0Google map of how the solar eclipse will look from different parts of Australia, a tool that may be helpful for some Australian eclipse chasers. Slooh\\'s webcast will be led by host Geoff Fox and Observatory Director Paul Cox, and feature guest expert Dr. Lucie Green, a BBC contributor and solar researcher at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL\\'s Department of Space and Climate Physics. You can watch it live on\\xa0Slooh.com\\xa0or by downloading the\\xa0Slooh iPad app. Viewers can ask questions during the show by using\\xa0hashtag #Slooh. The\\xa0Virtual Telescope Project\\xa0webcast, led by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi in Ceccano, Italy, will provide views of Tuesday\\'s solar eclipse with the help of a team of at least five astrophotographers located across Australia. Local Australians and photographers aren\\'t the only ones hoping for good weather and great solar eclipse views on Tuesday. Astronomer Jay Pasachoff of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. — a veteran 58 solar eclipses — will be observing the eclipse from Western Australia with colleague Robert Lucas. Pasachoff said he planned to photograph the solar eclipse with a Nikon 610 camera and some telephoto lens, while also meeting with the public to offer solar eclipse viewing advice. \"My role at this eclipse is thus as Chair of the Working Group on Eclipses of the International Astronomical Union for public outreach and to advise people how to observe the eclipse safely and how not to be scared of it or by it,\" he wrote in an email. \"Even 1 percent of the sun is 10,000 times brighter than the moon, so during the annular eclipse, the sun is too bright to look at directly,\" Williams College officials wrote in an advisory. \"If you have a special solar filter (or very dense welder\\'s glass), or project the image onto another surface, you can detect that the sun is being covered by the moon.\" Tuesday\\'s solar eclipse is the second eclipse of 2014 after the total lunar eclipse on April 15. The next total lunar eclipse will occur on Oct. 8 and will be primarily visible from the Pacific Ocean and its bordering coastlines. A partial solar eclipse visible from most of the United States and parts of Canada will then follow on Oct. 23. WARNING: Never look directly at the sun during an eclipse with a telescope or your unaided eye; severe eye damage can result. Scientists and amateur observers use special telescope filters or eclipse glasses to safely view the sun.

Each episode tackles fascinating questions about the world around us, from attempting to replicate stunts from viral videos to putting old adages to the test. It usually ends with something getting blown up in spectacular fashion. With hosts who are equal parts brilliant and batty, the show is a delight for any curious minds.   Image: Charles Dharapak/Associated Press         2. Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  One of the most charming makeover shows in recent history, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy made pop culture stars of its five hosts. Each episode focuses on a slovenly straight man who wants to clean up his act and needs a little guidance -- or, sometimes, a lot of guidance. It'd be worth watching just for the delightful antics of Carson, Kyan, Ted, Thom and Jai, but the show has lots of heart and sincerity about its subjects.           3. L.A. Ink  Nothing could be more appealing during a long winter than the sunny, carefree streets of Los Angeles. This show follows Kat Von D and the day-to-day life at her tattoo parlor. Especially in the early seasons, L.A. Ink gives an insightful look at the creative and personal side of the artists, all of them multi-talented individuals. And if you just can't get enough tattoo voyeurism, Netflix also has Miami Ink and NY Ink to sate your needs.   Image: Chris Pizzello/Associated Press         4. Top Gear  If you like fast cars and fast British wits, then you'll definitely enjoy this series, which has a sizable cult following worldwide. Top Gear shows off vehicles of all shapes and sizes, and its hosts talk about all the nitty gritty details of engine and build for serious motorheads. Expect to see races, celebrity interviews and, of course, that anonymous driver of mystery, The Stig.   Image: BBC         5. Keeping Up With the Kardashians  Celebrity antics are the bread and butter of the reality world, and nobody can deliver quite like the Kardashian clan. Netflix only has four seasons of the show, but those seasons are jam-packed with photo shoots, dating escapades, business deals, a wedding and more drama than a soap opera actor's convention. Sometimes, the most entertaining reality is the one most unlike your own.   Image: E! Networks         6. Dirty Jobs  For the times when your 9-to-5 job is getting you down, take a gander at Dirty Jobs. Affable host Mike Rowe and the production crew get their hands into some highly unusual and often highly disgusting jobs. It's a fascinating look at some vital but unsung professions.

Say Yes To The Dress offers the best combination of sweet stories and ridiculous drama. Whether or not you believe in spending many thousands of dollars on a fluffy white gown, the show offers an interesting look at how women approach their big day. As an added bonus, it's amazing raw material for a drinking game.   Video: YouTube, TLC       Winter is still refusing to release its grip, so it seems like as good a time as any to enjoy some television marathons and wait for spring to appear. If you're already caught up on the serious fare for the season, it might be time to delve into some guiltier pleasures.  Netflix has a collection of reality television shows that might just help you enjoy these last winter storms a little bit more. Whether you favor makeovers, people acting out or even a little education, there's a bit of reality for your streaming needs.

       " ' Many Republicans believe that President Obama gets a free pass from the media — so it stands to reason he might get special treatment from social media too.

Does he play by different rules??? — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) September 24, 2013  Which left many Twitter users scratching their heads, as there were only 136 characters in Obama\\'s tweet.

       " \" The biggest threat to your company's cybersecurity isn't malware, phishing scams or even hackers — it's you. In a series of studies published last week, three security research firms asked employees at midsize businesses across America about the biggest threats to corporate cybersecurity. And while the surveys each pointed to slightly different culprits, the verdict was clear: employees are the weakest link in the security chain. The largest of the three studies — a Stroz Friedberg online survey of more than 700 information workers — found that senior management may be the biggest threat to an organization's digital well-being. Fifty-eight percent of senior managers reported having (digitally) sent sensitive information to the wrong person. Compare that with just 25 percent of lower-level employees guilty of the same misstep. And more than half of all senior managers in the study admitted to taking files with them after they left a job. Only 25 percent of rank-and-file employees were found to have done the same. The Stroz Friedberg study also found that 9 in 10 senior managers admitted to uploading work files to personal email and cloud-based accounts, a faux pas that could lead to intellectual property theft and attacks on corporate networks.  SEE ALSO: Which Employees Are the Biggest Security Risk? In a second study by Osterman Research, 160 security professionals were asked about the biggest cyberthreats facing their companies. Seventy-four percent of respondents said that malware had posed a significant threat to their networks in the past year, while 64 percent said the same for email scams. And who did these security experts blame for such high rates of vulnerabilities? Workers themselves. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said that malware unknowingly downloaded by Web-surfing employees posed the biggest threat to corporate security. Fifty-six percent thought that the malware and phishing schemes rampant in personal webmail accounts were an even bigger threat to companies. Much like the Stroz Friedberg study, which noted that lax Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies were weakening corporate security, the Osterman study also found that BYOD policies were to blame for an increase in network vulnerabilities. Forty-six percent of security professionals questioned in the Osterman study said they no longer even try to manage the safe use of personal devices in the workplace. A third survey published last week — this one a SecureData survey of more than 100 IT professionals at midsize companies — also found that clear security management strategies for employees were lacking within their organizations. And 60 percent of the IT staffers surveyed listed employee carelessness as the biggest threat to a company's cybersecurity. The studies were compiled in a blog post by security provider Sophos.

       " ' ARLINGTON, Washington — For at least 30 minutes on Tuesday night, things almost felt normal again in Arlington, Wash. Kids chased one another on the lawn, a volunteer walked around with a tray of hot cocoa, and a local man played guitar and sang as others joined him at the gazebo in downtown Arlington\\'s Legion Memorial Park. Even the rain, which came down in buckets at times throughout the afternoon, had stopped.  See also: 10 More Bodies Found in Washington Mudslide, Unofficial Death Toll Now 24 It was a welcome sight, as citizens of Arlington and nearby Oso held a candlelight vigil to honor the victims of a deadly mudslide that took place Saturday morning. Officials confirmed Tuesday that 16 bodies have been recovered, and another eight are presumed dead, but out of reach of rescuers. In total, the unofficial death toll is 24, with more than 170 still missing.  It’s a tragedy that has rocked nearby communities, and attracted interest from national media, which have flocked to Arlington for daily search and rescue updates. And while there have been concerns in the past about the area’s geographic stability, it seems no one in Oso was prepared for a disaster like this.  “It touched us deeply because we know they’re people just like us,” said Rose McClelland, who traveled with her daughter from Marysville, Wash., about 15 miles south of Arlington, to join the vigil. “It could have been any of us … This touched us so deeply.” Hundreds of people attended Tuesday’s vigil, and many held candles, passing around the flame to those standing nearby. Erin Garcia, an Oso resident who lives on Highway 530 and was born and raised in Arlington, was at the vigil with her three children. She was told to evacuate her home Saturday afternoon in case debris from the slide would create a dam in the nearby North Fork Stillaguamish River, which would have flooded her home.   Hundreds of people attended a vigil to remember the victims of a deadly mudslide that took place Saturday morning.Image:  Mashable,  Kurt WagnerGarcia and her family packed up everything they could into their cars — pictures, clothes, even TVs — and moved in with her cousin in Arlington until returning home Monday afternoon. Both Garcia and her children know some of the missing people, but in a small community like Oso, this puts them in the majority.  “It’s heartbreaking, and there’s probably a lot more people [missing] that we do know that we don’t even realize because we don’t talk to them often,” she said. “Every one of us knows someone who is affected by this.\" Garcia’s cousin, Lynn Choate of Arlington, said her 13-year-old son’s arena football teammate is missing along with most of the teammate\\'s family. The team was scheduled to play a game in Spokane, Wash. Saturday when the mudslide hit, but it was canceled.  “The whole family was home on a fluke,” Garcia said.   Officials said they will continue to search at full capacity on Wednesday, and Travis Hots, fire chief for Snohomish County Fire Protection District 21, said he is holding out hope that rescuers will come across some survivors amid the rubble. In the meantime, locals will continue to await news of the friends and family they know are missing.  \"Everyday the kids go to school and there are just so many people missing, and they don’t know if it’s because they were evacuated or [unaccounted for],” Garcia said. “[This vigil] just shows what a small community can do.” ',\n",
       " ' North Korea is expected to mooch off other nations for cyber offensive tools because it is not plugged into the global web, according to the Defense Department’s first report to Congress on the regime\\'s military might. These are some of the spare details describing Pyongyang’ network operations found amidst a larger discussion of the regime\\'s\\xa0antagonism with South Korea and pursuit of nuclear weapons. \"As a result of North Korea’s historical isolation from outside communications and influence, it is likely to employ Internet infrastructure from third-party nations,\" states\\xa0the 26-page\\xa0report, which Defense Department Secretary Chuck Hagel released on Thursday. The unclassified 2012 assessment\\xa0concludes the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \"probably\" has the capability to carry out military computer network operations. Since 2009, the nation has been linked to cyber espionage campaigns and distributed denial of service attacks that externally flood websites with paralyzing traffic, according to the Pentagon. Cybersecurity researchers speculated suppliers for North Korean cyber fights could range from Chinese telecommunications giants to unwitting nations with connectivity that is not hard for Pyongyang to steal. “Two of the world\\'s biggest Internet infrastructure suppliers are Huawei and ZTE and there\\'s a good chance North Korea\\'s Internet infrastructure relies heavily on their equipment,” Martyn Williams, editor of the North Korea Tech website, which chronicles the regime’s use of information technology, said in an email. “Chinese providers are really the only choice as the DPRK can\\'t really interconnect with South Korean or Japanese providers.” That said, it’s easy for commodity products to take a detour through a third country on their way to sanctioned destinations; that reportedly was the route censorship technology took to Syria. “If, for example, the North Koreans wanted Cisco routers it probably wouldn\\'t be difficult to get them,” Williams added. North Korea sends military youth to India and China for university training, so both Internet-enabled countries might offer resources, suggested Jeffrey Carr, a cyberwar analyst and author of Inside Cyberwarfare (O\\'Reilly Media 2009). \\xa0 And then there’s the atomic bargaining chip. North Koreans “also have a good relationship with Iran, which would certainly provide the DPRK with whatever they asked in exchange for the DPRK\\'s help with nuclear fuel enrichment,” Carr said. Congress in 2011 required Defense to produce annual classified and unclassified reports on military development in North Korea.  Pentagon officials informed lawmakers that the Seoul Central Prosecutor’s office reportedly implicated DPRK in 2011 cyber incidents affecting servers at South Korea\\'s Nonghyup Bank. Remote \"actors rendered the bank’s online services inaccessible and deleted numerous files concerning customer bank accounts while removing all evidence\" of unauthorized activity on the servers, the Defense report states.  Several high-profile cyber events involving the regime are not mentioned. For instance, in March, experts worldwide accused North Korea of immobilizing computers at South Korea\\'s key broadcasters and ATMs. This was one of a series of cyber spats between North Korean and South Korean supporters that began when the United Nations imposed sanctions on the northern nation for nuclear tests. “The report is worded carefully,” Williams said. “You\\'ll note it doesn\\'t accuse North Korea of doing anything, but rather says the South Korean government or local newspapers have reported the DPRK is [behind] the attacks.” The study indeed acknowledges that proving North Korea responsible for network abnormalities is difficult because of the web\\'s inherent anonymity and distributed structure. Williams added, \"The evidence is growing that North Korea is behind at least some of these attacks, but everyone is still pretty much guessing.\" Image via KNS/AFP/Getty Images  The Perfect Email Why Won’t Trump Blame the DNC Hack on Russia?

       " '     Peter Sunde, co-founder of BitTorrent search engine The Pirate Bay, needs your help to create a private messaging app.  Heml.is (Swedish word for \"secret\") is an elegant messaging app for iOS and Android that uses end-to-end encryption to make sure no third party — governments and ISPs included — can intercept the users\\' communication.  SEE ALSO: Is It the Dawn of the Encryption App?  \"We love the Internet, social networks and the power it gives for sharing and social connections. What we don\\'t love though is that private communication has more or less turned into an open stream for companies and governments to listen into,\" the Heml.is team explains on the app\\'s official page.  In a video explaining the app\\'s purpose, Sunde references the recent PRISM scandal, a secret NSA program that taps into major Internet companies\\' data and accesses user emails, photographs and other documents.  \"We\\'ve decided to build a messaging platform where no one can spy on you, not even us,\" explains Sunde in the video (above).  The app is crowdfunded with a goal of $100,000, with the donation counter currently standing at $27,000. Users who donate $5 or more get unlock codes for the app and other perks, depending on the size of the donation.  Once finished, the app\\'s basic functionality will be free. Some features, such as sending image messages, will be charged for.   Visually, the app borrows heavily from the recently introduced iOS 7\\'s aesthetics, with pastel colors and an overall light, simple design.  However, private messaging apps aren\\'t new. Apps like Wickr or iCrypt already enable users to send encrypted messages to one another. It\\'ll be interesting to see how Heml.is fares against the competition, and whether it\\'ll stay a niche product or get a large following.  Image courtesy of Heml.is ',\n",

The company\\'s unsuccessful Kickstarter project and failure to attract big-time donors forced the opera\\'s board and management to file for bankruptcy. \"New York City Opera did not achieve the goal of its emergency appeal,\" the NYC Opera informed donors on its Kickstarter page. \"[We] will begin the necessary financial and operational steps to wind down the Company including initiating the Chapter 11 process.\" See also: 7 Music Discovery Tools to Find New Tunes Fundraising efforts have come to a halt, as the opera — which former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia dubbed \"The People\\'s Opera\" — now plans to shut down.

       " ' LONDON — Comments made by the UKIP candidate standing in a by-election taking place Thursday have again focused attention on the party\\'s policies concerning migrants from the European Union.  Mark Reckless suggested that existing European Union migrants should only be allowed to stay in the UK for a \"transitional period\" if Britain opted to leave the EU.  See also: Beautiful graphics visualise hectic life in London His comments were made during a pre-election hustings, or meeting, at the University of Kent, which was televised by ITV. The by-election was prompted after he resigned his seat as a Conservative MP. Asked what would happen to the \"Polish plumber who lives in Rochester\" if the UK exited the EU, he responded: \"Well, I think in the near term we\\'d probably have to have a transitional period and I think we should probably allow people who are currently here to have a work permit for a fixed period.\" Questioned if he would he still deport the so-called Polish plumber if he had a house, a family and kids at the local school, Reckless said they would \"look sympathetically\" at people who had been in the UK for a long time and had \"integrated.\"  Mark Reckless at the hustings ahead of Thursday\\'s by-election in RochesterImage:  ITV\"What we would want to do is look at new people coming in and apply a consistent Australian-style point system and the same to people coming from Europe as we do to people coming from the Commonwealth or Australia, Africa, India the Caribbean,\" he said. \"We shouldn\\'t have a discriminatory system, which favours Europeans against people from outside.\"   Reckless subsequently said Wednesday that he is in favour of deporting people who are living in the UK but are originally from other EU countries, telling the BBC that a person from the EU, legally, would not be deported but have to apply for a work permit.   His remarks bring UKIP and other political parties\\' positions on immigration and the UK\\'s membership of the EU under the spotlight. As expected, together with the economy, they have been central issues during the by-election and they will likely be a big focus impending general election, which is less than six months away. Brits abroad Migration doesn\\'t only go one way, as figures from UK government show. Between 1.4 million and 2 million British citizens live across the European Union. If the country opted to leave the EU there would be a number of member countries that could, if they adopted the type of policies suggested by UKIP\\'s Reckless, review the status of the British-citizens living in them.  Figures released in August by the Office for National Statistics show that 12.4% of the UK\\'s population were born outside of the country and of that figure, 4.3% or 2.6 million people migrated from the 27 countries that make up the Eurozone, while 8.2% or 5 million people came from non-EU countries. Here are the top five countries where British citizens live:   Where are UK citizens living in the EU?        1. Spain  Estimates vary for the number of British-born people living in Spain. 2011 figures from The World Bank said there were 411,000 British-born citizens living there, however estimates from the Institute for Public Policy in 2009 put that figure at 808,000, rising to above 1 million if part-time residents are included.  The majority of UK-born citizens in Spain are between the ages of 25 and 64. The Home Office noted in a report that there were high rates of people who didn’t register with the local authorities, so the figure could well be more than the estimates.    Image: Flickr, Manuel Vidal         2. Ireland  Ireland is the second most popular destination for UK-born citizens with some 397,000 resident there, according to the World Bank. Over the past six years, on average 10,000 UK-born migrants move to Ireland each year. According to Ireland\\'s 2011 census, 212,286 people born in the England and Wales, 58,470 from Northern Ireland and 17,871 from Scotland were resident in Ireland. The majority of UK-born citizens in the country are between the ages of 42 and 54.    Image: Flickr, Jim Nix         3. France  Some 173,000 UK-born residents live across the English Channel in France. The UK Home Office said in a report that as UK unemployment fell more British people emigrated, compared with when unemployment was at an all-time high. \"This seems counter-intuitive but might be partly due to unemployed people having fewer resources to fund a move abroad,\" it says. The majority of UK residents intending to move to France said they would be moving for more than four years, according to the Home Office.    Image: Flickr, Vincent Brassinne         4. Germany  Approximately 155,000 UK-born residents were living in Germany in 2011, according to the World Bank\\'s figures. Germany is a more short-term destination for the Britons who move there. A third of British migrants expected to stay for more than five years, 21% said they would be there for between two and four years and 15% were there for even shorter stays of between one and two years.  Germany is one of the top destinations for British migrants whose main reason for emigrating was to accompany another person. It is also a popular European destination for UK students.   Image: Flickr, Sascha Kohlmann         5. The Netherlands As the fifth most popular destination for British citizens within the European Union, the Netherlands is home to 46,000 people born in the UK. Figures from the Institute for Public Policy Research for 2006 show that the Netherlands was one of the top ten countries for sending remittances back to Britain.

       " ' Last week, NPR\\'s All Things Considered featured a story called \"The First Web Page, Amazingly, Is Lost.\" The piece ended with a plea: Perhaps someone out there, someone listening to their radio, picked up an old optical disk drive that was lost at a conference in 1990. Check your bookshelves. Check your basement. The early web might still be out there.  Soon, a comment appeared on the NPR story. \"I have a copy of the page that Tim [Berners-Lee] used as a demo at Hypertext 91 in San Antonio,\" Paul Jones wrote. He also tweeted, \".@thefirstwebsite I have a copy of the page that @timberners_lee used to present at Hypertext 91 http://www.ibiblio.org/pjones/old.page.html ... others on my cube [an early \\'90s computer].\" \"Amazing!\" tweeted back The First Website, a project at CERN devoted to reconstructing the web\\'s infancy. \"We\\'ll be in touch,\" they promised. Jones\\'s file — uploaded to ibiblio.org more than two decades ago and sitting there \"almost continually\" ever since — wasn\\'t that 1990 disk drive that NPR sought, but, dating from just one year later, it is believed to be the closest copy of the original pages of the World Wide Web. Here\\'s what it looks like (head to the page for the full interactive experience):  On his site, Jones, a professor a UNC-Chapel Hill and a published poet, tells the story of how he got this copy, and how \"demonstration\" became \"demonfdgfgstration\" in the process. The story begins, as you would expect, in the early \\'90s, when Jones colleague Jim Fullton got an email from Berners-Lee (they had been in touch about a related project) saying that he was submitting a paper to a conference, Hypertext 91, that would be taking place in San Antonio that December. Berners-Lee was interested in stopping by UNC during his trip. Berners-Lee\\'s paper was rejected (\"The hypertext community were unimpressed with the web; it looked rather simple,\" CERN\\'s Dan Noyes explains in a post) but he was offered a table where he could demonstrate his World Wide Web to conference attendees. \"Only a couple of catches,\" Jones writes. \"There was to be no Internet connectivity at the conference. And as Tim\\'s demonstration required a NeXT computer, he would have to bring his from Europe.\" Jones, it turns out, also owned a NeXT, one just like Berners-Lee\\'s. When Berners-Lee arrived in North Carolina, he stopped by to talk shop. Jones writes:  We talked about WAIS [Wide Area Information Servers] and WWW and beer and he pulled out a floptical drive (NeXT pioneered a read-write optical disk in a case. No one followed). I installed Tim\\'s graphical browser on my NeXT. Tim talked me through using WWW by using a copy of his Hypertext 91 demonstration page. There was, as you see now, a link to the WWW< >WAIS gateway for searching a database in the next room. When I clicked on the link, my information request first went to CERN in Switzerland then back to UNC to search the database. The results then left UNC for Switzerland where html was added and then the results sent back to my NeXT. Tim showed me how simple and easy editing and creating a WWW page could be. First he showed how straightforward editing was by changing\"demonstration\" to \"demonfdgfgstration.\" I created my own page and added a link to an FTP site in Denmark that hosted a sound collection among other things. I wanted to see if the NeXT and Tim\\'s WWW browser would be able to pass the sound to a player. I think it did, but I really can\\'t remember if it did.  Jones still has his NeXT and it may be full of other cool early web artifacts. Just one problem: He can\\'t remember the password. Jones says on Twitter that he thinks of himself \"not as a hoarder but as a digital curator.\" Whatever name you want to put on it, it\\'s a habit that has paid off. Photo: Tim Berners-Lee.

       " ' A penguin that lived more than 35 million years ago was the largest ever, and would stand twice as tall as today\\'s largest penguin, according to new fossil evidence. Palaeeudyptes klekowskii would have stood about 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighed around 250 pounds, according to analysis of new bones found on Seymour Island in Antarctica by an Argentinian museum researcher. The newly discovered bones — a partial wing and an ankle-and-foot-bone structure called the tarsometatarsus — gave Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche, from the La Plata Museum in Argentina, a way to derive the height of the long-lost penguin giant. SEE ALSO: Five Fantastic Animal Fathers Today\\'s largest penguin, the Emperor penguin, stands about 3 and a half feet tall, making it Spud Webb next to the Shaquille O\\'Neal that was P. klekowskii.

The new bones aren\\'t the first ever found for P. klekowskii; Seymour Island contains no shortage of penguin fossils.

       " ' Days before Facebook unveils its Q3 earnings figures, multiple ad partners for the social network found that Facebook ads improved in nearly every metric in year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons.  See also: 10 Hot Social Networks to Watch The reports come from Adobe and Kenshoo Social, which are both part of Facebook\\'s Strategic Preferred Marketing Developer program, meaning they drive \"outstanding positive impact in [Facebook\\'s] marketing developer ecosystem.\" The first annual Social Media Intelligence report released Monday by Adobe found that Facebook\\'s ad clicks, ad impressions and advertisers\\' return on investment were all higher in 2013 than in 2012. According to the study, which took into account more than 131 billion Facebook ad impressions and 4.3 billion social engagements, Facebook ads were clicked 29% more often in 2013, and the return to investors was 58% higher than last year. Other advertising metrics like cost-per-click were lower (by 40%), meaning advertising on Facebook is becoming cheaper and more effective, according to Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst of Adobe\\'s Digital Index. In some cases, Gaffney said, Facebook and other social platforms like Twitter and Pinterest are being undervalued by marketers using the last click model.  The last click model means that users may see an ad for an item they like on Facebook, then buy it online at a later date without going through Facebook to the retailer\\'s website. The purchase is still driven by the Facebook ad, but Facebook doesn\\'t always get the credit.  One of Facebook\\'s News Feed ads. A separate study by Kenshoo Social found many of the same ad metric improvements for the company\\'s Q3 over Q2. According to Kenshoo\\'s data, which incorporates info from 85 million Facebook ads, ad clicks were up 14%, cost-per-click was down 9% and advertisers\\' returns were 3 times higher than the same figures last quarter.  These improvements were similar to Kenshoo\\'s findings for Facebook ads last quarter. It appears that marketers can expect similar improvements moving ahead into the future.  \"Part of the reason Facebook seems to accelerate each quarter is because of adoption,\" said Aaron Goldman, Kenshoo CMO. \"As more and more advertisers use it, they get more and more signals about how they can improve their ad delivery.\"  In other words, the ads are growing more effective over time, according to Goldman.  Facebook is not alone in its social ad success. Adobe\\'s report found that both Twitter and Pinterest made significant ground on Facebook in terms of referral traffic to retail sites. Facebook still holds the top spot, but Twitter\\'s share of referral traffic grew more than 250% last year.  \"I had thought that Facebook was running away with the game,\" Gaffney said. \"What\\'s coming out of our data set is that Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr are all making inroads themselves in a marketplace that I thought was already [dominated].\" Image: Facebook(Let), Flickr ',\n",
       " '     What happens when you create a car advertisement depicting suicide? Hyundai tried that stunt in the UK last week, and by Thursday the Hyundai ad had certainly garnered plenty of attention, but not at all the kind of reaction the Korean car company had hoped for. Blistering criticism is erupting from across the globe toward the Hyundai spot. The 60-second commercial, entitled \"Pipe Job,\" depicts a man attempting to commit suicide by starting his Hyundai iX35 car inside an enclosed garage. The intent of the ad was to tout the car\\'s low emissions, as one of its main byproducts is harmless water. Many said via Twitter that the move was insult to everyone who has ever had to cope with loved ones committing or attempting suicide. Particularly heartbreaking is this open letter to Hyundai and the ad agency that created it, Innocean. The letter was written by London advertising copywriter Holly Brockwell, which she posted on her blog, Copybot: When your ad started to play, and I saw the beautifully-shot scenes of taped-up car windows with exhaust feeding in, I began to shake. I shook so hard that I had to put down my drink before I spilt it. And then I started to cry. I remembered looking out of the window to see the police and ambulance, wondering what was happening. I remember mum sitting me down to explain that daddy had gone to sleep and would not be waking up, and no, he wouldn\\'t be able to take me to my friend’s birthday party next week. No, he couldn’t come back from heaven just for that day, but he would like to if he could. I remember finding out that he had died holding my sister’s soft toy rabbit in his lap. Take a look at her blog for the full text of her poignant open letter, along with pictures of her father and his suicide note. We\\'ve contacted Hyundai for comment, and while we wait for a response, here\\'s the apology the company submitted on Thursday, in an attempt to quell the worldwide firestorm of criticism: We understand that some people may have found the iX35 video offensive. We are very sorry if we have offended anyone. We have taken the video down and have no intention of using it in any of our advertising or marketing. The misstep is a surprise for sophisticated advertiser Hyundai, which Mashable reported was one of the companies most committed to advertising on the Super Bowl. The company has bought ads on every Super Bowl for the past six years. However, we also noted that Hyundai\\'s track record with its ads has been mixed.  Update: Hyundai America issued the following response to the UK Hyundai IX35 ad: We at Hyundai Motor America are shocked and saddened by the depiction of a suicide attempt in an inappropriate UK video featuring a Hyundai. Suicide merits thoughtful discussion, not this type of treatment. Update 2: The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention sent us this statement: \"We know from research that graphic depictions of suicide in the media can inadvertently lead to further suicides, a phenomenon known as contagion,\" said Robert Gebbia, executive director for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  \"This advertisement was particularly graphic and potentially dangerous. We are pleased that Hyundai has decided to pull this campaign. That said, we hope that advertisers and companies realize that suicide is a worldwide health problem that claims more than 1 million lives each year, taking an enormous toll on family, friends, co-workers and entire communities and it should not be used to sell products.\" This is not the first time a car company has tried to make light of suicide to sell its products. French car manufacturer Citroën had a similar ad a few years ago.  Let us know in the comments what you think of Hyundai\\'s crude attempt at dark comedy.

One of them, dedicated to the Kepler mission that searches for habitable exoplanets, had an announcement posted that read, \"Down for Maintenance: The requested webpage is down for maintenance. Please try again later.\" As Naked Security noted, these websites are all hosted in the heart of Silicon Valley. Although NASA is a high-profile hacking target, CWZ CyberCrime maintains the agency “is now more famous for its poor cyber security rather than anything else.”  An exaggeration, though maybe not from the security point of view.  Earlier-known security problems include the exposure of the algorithms used to command and control the International Space Station. Data on the agency’s Constellation and Orion programs were leaked, as was personal information on thousands of NASA employees. Twice.  The deface page each site the hackers hit was papered over with:  “NASA HACKED! BY #BMPoCWe!  Stop spy on us! The Brazilian population do not support your attitude! The Illuminati are now visibly acting! Obama heartless! Inhumane! you have no family? the point in the entire global population is supporting you. NOBODY! We do not want war, we want peace!!!

The same hacker or hacking group clipped NASA domains before, hitting four sites in April. A NASA spokesman, reversing an earlier statement, told Fox News that the sites were hit but that no information was compromised.

Image:  Mashable, Will Fenstermaker       NBC’s last Olympics was either a rousing success or a spectacular failure, depending on who you ask. The failures, as some called aspects of the coverage, were painstakingly documented in the #NBCFail hashtag that served as a sounding board for complaints about the tape-delayed coverage of the opening ceremony and some of the most anticipated events, in addition to spoiling the Michael Phelps/Ryan Lochte showdown. The success made a smaller splash on social media but a bigger impact on NBC\\'s bottom line - record setting viewership helped the broadcaster turn an unexpected profit on the Summer games. Two years later, NBC is set to change little about its Olympics coverage. For the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the opening ceremony will air eight-and-a-half hours after it actually happens; primetime coverage will be a melange of taped coverage of the most popular events; online users will need to authenticate their cable subscriptions to gain access to live streaming of the events. NBC has a good reason for changing so little; 219 million people tuned into the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, making it “the most-watched television event in U.S. history,” according to the broadcaster. The few changes NBC has made represent an important call on the intersection of traditional and digital media — namely that more is more.  \"What we found in London was that the people who were live-streaming Olympic content during the day on a PC or laptop or a tablet were actually more likely to watch more Olympic television than people who weren’t live-streaming or engaged in some form of other kind of contact with the Olympics,\" said Jim Bell, NBC Olympics executive producer, in a recent conference call. That revelation has led NBC to double down on its digital investments in an effort to follow a simple rule - the more Olympics you give people, the more they want. Streaming Hits the Mainstream Much of the criticism of NBC from the London games touched on tape delay and other aspects outside of the digital side, but not all of it fell on deaf ears. “We got through London and we learned some things,” said Rick Cordella, senior vice president and general manager of digital media for NBC Sports Group, during an interview at the new NBC Sports headquarters in Stamford, Conn. Cordella heads ups the live streaming operation for NBC, including the Olympics. A former college basketball player, he has overseen some of the biggest changes from the 2012 Olympics and almost certainly from the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, when NBC only streamed 400 hours of ice hockey and curling. This year, NBC will stream all Olympic events live for a total of around 1,000 hours of coverage. Digital coverage is selling more ads, but it has also correlated with a more important trend — a rise in overall viewership. As NBC’s live streaming has picked up, so have critics of the coverage schedule. Cordella, and more broadly NBC, has control over only so much. But he watched the social media discussion himself. Some of it was noise; some of it reasonable and insightful. “From that, we kind of reacted to it. We completely redesigned the website from start to finish. We said ‘what should a website in 2014 look like?’ And if you visit it, you’ll see that it’s more of a feed-driven mentality,” he said. Walking through the halls of the 300,000-square foot, former shampoo factory turned NBC Sports headquarters, Cordella highlighted the numerous areas that have been dedicated to digital content. Sochi will be the first Olympics for the 33-acre campus in Stamford, Conn., which includes a dedicated studio as well as what he called “the highlight factory,’ a room full of computers that will be humming at all hours to splice clips for online consumption. A similar area is dedicated to online ad insertion.  A view from the outside of the NBC Sports headquarters. The 30,000 foot building is just a year old and gearing up for its first Olympics.That influx of capital is needed for an area that is becoming increasingly relied upon by content consumers and advertisers. Previously, selling digital ad space of the Olympics was difficult, Cordella said. “[In Beijing] it was hard to get advertisers to buy into a digital website. You had to leverage TV assets in order to do it,” he said. “As you move forward now, it’s a bigger piece of the media pie.” The size of that pie is very important to NBC. The broadcaster claimed a loss on the Beijing Olympics and a slight profit in London. A recent report estimates NBC revenue from Sochi around $1.05 billion. Digital ad sales have accounted for $50 million, or around 5%. Television ads remain the primary source of revenue, but with digital consumption leading the trend of overall viewership, the additional revenue is a cherry on top of its growing Olympic pie. Going for the Gold (Zone) NBC is plenty experienced in streaming sports, with ice hockey, English football and golf among its properties. The Olympics, however, is its own type of sporting event, Cordella said. “We prepare as best we possibly can for the Olymipcs,” he said. “But the olympics are a unique event.” Not content just to air all the events, NBC is rolling out specialty streams to help highlight aspects of the games. “What we wanted to do was basically be able to shout from the mountain tops what is important right now,” he said. Among the few new offerings is an NFL-inspired channel that will operate like a real-time highlights package. “Gold Zone” rapidly shifts between sports in an effort to provide viewers with coverage of the most pressing live events. The show will be hosted by Ryan Burr and Andrew Siciliano, the latter of which hosts NFL Sunday Ticket Fed Zone on DirecTV. Cordella has previously acknowledged that Gold Zone had been heavily influenced by similar NFL shows. Another speciality streaming show, “Olympic Ice,” will focus on figure skating, traditionally one of the most popular winter Olympics events. Cordella stressed that while NBC has invested heavily in digital content, consumer pressure would continue to be an issue. “The expectations of streaming are getting higher and higher,” he said. “The Olympics bring in a broader audience and they’re doing all this for the first time, so their expectations start with ‘this should be tv quality.’” Cordella added that the evolving platforms on which they need to offer content - tablets, smartphones, Android and iOS operating systems - force almost constant adaptation. “It would be great at some point 20 years from now, maybe to sit back and say ‘wow, we’ve done everything now and the technology didn’t change in the last four years and everybody’s using the same devices on the same platforms.’ But even iOS gets better,” he said.

       " ' LOS ANGELES — A little Hunger Games fatigue was to be expected, but a 23 percent slide? That was not. At $123 million, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 bullseyed the biggest U.S. box office opening of 2014, with the June 27 release Transformers: Age of Extinction trailing safely behind at an even $100 million. By any measure, Mockingjay was a hit — except one. SEE ALSO: Listen to Jennifer Lawrence sing a haunting tune from \\'Mockingjay\\' That would be The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, which streaked to $158 million last year, and still stands as the 6th largest U.S. opening weekend of all time. That was just a shade better than the inaugural Hunger Games, which announced a new mega-franchise in 2012 with its staggering $152 million opening weekend. So what happened? Nothing that makes any real sense.  The critical consensus around Mockingjay was off roughly 20 percent — from mid-to-high 80s down to 66 percent, according to Rotten Tomatoes.  But that never dinged a Twilight movie — The Twilight Saga: New Moon loaded up a franchise record $142.8 million opening weekend for arguably its worst-reviewed installment in 2009, a film that got a sickly 28 percent on the Tomatometer. And Summit/Lionsgate followed up that film with the first half of its cloven-in-two Twilight finale, which held well at $138 million. Lionsgate applied its two-part endgame strategy to The Hunger Games, but to a strikingly different result. Same distributor, same highly social marketing team, same pre-Thanksgiving date, with a cast that went from up-and-coming to fully arrived, even adding some names to the marquee.  Pre-weekend estimates even had Mockingjay nipping at the heels of Catching Fire, with some tracking services predicting just shy of $150 million. And its CinemaScore, which polls moviegoers on the way out, was an A-minus; not spectacular, but it shows they didn\\'t reject it. Whatever caused Mockingjay to lag so far behind its predecessors, Lionsgate can be fairly sure it has the biggest domestic opening of 2014 safely in-hand, as nothing left on the schedule is going to come anywhere near $123 million. And the Canadian company — Hollywood\\'s seventh major studio — will likely rake in more international cash with Mockingjays both 1 and 2 than the previous two films. No one is calling Mockingjay - Part 1 anything other than a giant financial success. But there are appearances to be kept up in Panem. \"Alive and well\" is not the message we\\'re getting from a $35 million drop as we head into the finales.  What do you think caused Mockingjay to fly lower than its predecessors? Let us know in the comments. ',\n",
       " ' UPDATED, 11:00 p.m. ET President Obama announced Thursday night that he had authorized U.S. airstrikes in Iraq if militants from the Islamic State (also known as ISIL or ISIS) approached the strategically important northern city of Erbil, where U.S. personnel are stationed. In a national address, the president said U.S. planes were also authorized to provide air support to thousands of members of an ethnic group in Iraq, the Yazidis, if the militants make a move toward the mountain they\\'re stranded on. See also: Kurdish Freedom Comes at a Heavy Price U.S. airstrikes would mark a significant shift in the nation\\'s strategy in Iraq, where the military fully withdrew in late 2011 after nearly a decade of war. Obama, who made his remarks in a steady and somber tone, has staked much of his legacy as president on ending what he has called the \"dumb war\" in Iraq. The U.S. has not yet conducted airstrikes, senior administration officials said after the speech, but there were reports earlier in the day of airstrikes in the region, possibly by the Iraqi air force. Obama confirmed that the U.S. had begun airdropping food and water to the Yazidi group, which is stranded on Mount Sinjar near Mosul in northern Iraq after fleeing the Islamic militants.

But he\\'d decided that in this case, \"we can act carefully and responsibly to prevent a potential act of genocide.\"  U.S. officials said the first round of airdropped supplies included 5,300 gallons of drinking water and 8,000 ready-to-eat meals (MREs), using one C-17 and two C-130 U.S. aircraft and escorted by two American F/A-18s.   Just in, details on the operation in Iraq from the Pentagon. pic.twitter.com/z1DXWhWkkp — Defense One (@DefenseOne) August 8, 2014  If those MREs came from the U.S. military\\'s 2014 menu, which is likely, they likely included entrees like beef shredded in barbecue sauce, chicken with noodles and vegetables and “Mediterranean Chicken.” The Yezidis, according to a 2010 BBC interview, have no stated dietary restrictions, although the elders avoid cabbage because \"they cause gases.”  The humanitarian airdrop operation, Pentagon officials said, took less than 15 minutes. Estimates of the number of people trapped on the mountain have ranged as high as 40,000, but the officials said the size of the group was likely smaller. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel commended the men and women who executed the operation, he said in a statement, and pledged to provide “increased support” to the Iraqis once they’ve successfully formed a new government. Earlier in the day, Kurdish and Iraqi officials told The New York Times that the operations were the first stage of an \"American-led intervention.\" But senior administration officials said airstrikes would be used only to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and aid the Yazidis. \"This was not the authorization of a broad-based counterterrorism campaign against ISIL,\" one official said.  Obama met with his national security team Thursday morning to discuss the crisis as the Islamic State group made further gains. Officials said the militants had launched a multipronged attack Saturday night across a wide swath of northern Iraq.  President Barack Obama meets with his national security advisors in the Situation Room of the White House, Aug. 7, 2014.Fleeing the Islamic State Many of the Yazidi families chose to head north to escape militants from the Islamic State. Stranded on Mount Sinjar, the refugees lack food, water and basic necessities.  At least 40 children have died of dehydration, the relief agency Unicef said, noting there were 25,000 more that needed immediate humanitarian assistance. “There are children dying on the mountain, on the roads,” Marzio Babille, a Unicef representative, said in a statement. “There is no water, there is no vegetation, they are completely cut off and surrounded by Islamic State. It’s a disaster, a total disaster.\" “Children have died because of dehydration and lack of food,” Vian Dakheel, the Yazidis\\' sole representative in the Iraqi parliament, said in a moving speech on Wednesday, helping raise the visibility of the Yazidis\\' plight. “My people are being slaughtered,” she said. \"We are being slaughtered. We are being exterminated,\" she cried. \"An entire religion is being exterminated from the face of the Earth.\"  Who are the Yazidis? The Yazidis are a religious minority that lives primarily in northern Iraq. They have been persecuted for centuries for their religious beliefs and wrongly described as \"devil-worshippers.\" They accept no converts and permit marriages only within the community. Yazidis say they have been targeted dozens of times in persecution campaigns, most recently this past week by militants from the Islamic State.  The Islamic State has waged a swift and brutal campaign in the region, taking large swaths of territory stretching across Syria and Iraq in recent months.  Their goal is to create a Sunni Caliphate in the heart of the Middle East.  In the course of their offensive, they have slain civilians and executed security forces, often documenting their bloody exploits on Twitter. The Turkish government said on Thursday that it had airdropped humanitarian aid to some of the stranded families on the mountaintop.  And the White House had indicated that it was monitoring the Yazidis\\' plight. \"The situation is nearing a humanitarian catastrophe,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday in a briefing with reporters. \"We are gravely concerned for their health and safety.\" U.S. options Obama used the threat of an imminent humanitarian crisis as a rationale for limited U.S. military action in Libya in 2010, as forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi threatened a massacre in Benghazi. The U.S. and its NATO partners launched a bombing campaign over Libya, with Obama moving forward without congressional approval. Obama\\'s authorization of airstrikes Thursday was done without formal congressional approval. Lawmakers left town last week for a five-week recess, and there was no sign Thursday that Congress was being called back. Some Republicans had expressly called for the president to take action and said he didn\\'t need the approval of lawmakers.

       " ' Now that Apple has released OS X Mavericks to the masses — for free — we know that plenty of users are busy downloading the latest software update and preparing to install the new operating system. As with OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion, Apple makes it easy for users to install the upgrade by downloading Mavericks from the App Store and running the installer. See also: Apple iPad Air Event: Everything You Need to Know This method works for almost all users — it keeps your data and existing programs intact and upgrades your machine to the latest OS. But sometimes, you might not want to do a regular OS upgrade.  It\\'s possible to do a clean install of OS X Mavericks on your Mac — or on a new hard drive, if you\\'re upgrading or repairing your Mac — but it takes a bit of work. The process is a bit more complicated than it has been in previous years, but it\\'s still relatively easy to create a bootable copy of OS X Mavericks that you can run from a USB stick or other drive. Note: A clean install will erase all of the contents on your disk drive. Make sure to back up your important files, settings and apps before proceeding.   OS X Mavericks Clean Install        Getting Started  To do a clean install of OS X Mavericks, you\\'ll need a blank USB flash drive that is at least 8GB in size. You\\'ll be using this drive completely for OS X Mavericks, so don\\'t waste a larger drive if you have an 8GB available.  You can also use an existing hard drive partition, but that process complicates the second option for this installer. You\\'ll also need to download OS X Mavericks onto your existing Mac.   Image:  Apple, Screenshot by Mashable         Download OS X Mavericks  You can download OS X Mavericks from the Mac App Store here. This will download a 5.2GB file called \"Install OS X Mavericks\" to your Applications folder.   Image:  Apple, Screenshot by Mashable         Format USB Drive  Now, format the USB drive by opening up Disk Utility. It\\'s in the Utilities folder in Applications. Select your USB drive and click on the \"Erase\" tab. Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the format type and keep the name as \"untitled.\" Click the Erase button. This will take a few minutes, but will erase your USB drive will be erased and format it with the proper file system.   Image:  Apple, Screenshot by Mashable         Easiest Option: Use Lion DiskMaker App  A great app for automating the creation of an OS X bootable USB disk called Lion DiskMaker. Lion DiskMaker is still putting the final touches on its version compatible with Mavericks, but the creator\\'s latest beta version supports OS X 10.9 and will build a bootable USB. The only caveat is that you must have the Install OS X Mavericks file inside your Applications folder. This is far and away the easiest way to create a bootable copy of OS X Mavericks.  Although I\\'ve successfully built a number of bootable USB disks with Lion DiskMaker, be aware that in my tests, the process took more time than the manual method (below). If you\\'re low on time and high on efficiency, the manual method may be your best bet.   Image:  Lion DiskMaker, Screenshot by Mashable         Option 2: The Manual Way (Requires Terminal)  First, I\\'d like to thank MacRumors forum member tywebb13 for his instructions on creating a manual bootable USB copy of OS X Mavericks.  This method requires using the Terminal app. If you\\'re not comfortable typing commands into Terminal, just use the Lion DiskMaker app (above). To continue with using Terminal, follow the steps below. 1. After downloading OS X Mavericks to your Applications folder and formatting your USB drive (make sure it\\'s called \"Untitled\"), open up the Terminal app. 2. Paste the following command into the Terminal window and hit enter: 3. You will be prompted to enter in your user password. Then, you\\'ll see a list of processes on the terminal screen that read: Erasing Disk:Copying Installer files to disk...Done. This process runs a special mode built into the OS X Mavericks installer that can create installable media. The disk you\\'re copying the media onto becomes bootable, too.  The process takes less time than Lion DiskMaker, but you\\'ll need to follow the instructions exactly. Don\\'t move the installer to another folder, and make sure you don\\'t have more than one disk drive titled \"Untitled\" connected to your machine.   Image:  Apple, Screenshot by Mashable         Booting Up and Installing  Once your USB drive has been created, it\\'s time to install Mavericks. 1. Restart (or boot up) your Mac with the USB drive connected and hold down on the Option key. You should see a screen that lets you select a number of different hard drives, including your USB drive that reads, \"Install OS X Mavericks.\" 2. Click on that drive to open up a list of settings. If you just want to do a typical OS X installation, you can do so (but then, why did you take the time to make the bootable media?).  3. For a clean install, open up Disk Utility and erase your main hard drive. Once you\\'ve done so, you can go back to the Install OS X Mavericks disk and choose \"Install a new copy of OS X.\"   Image:  Mashable, Christina Warren      After the Install After installing OS X Mavericks, you can start restoring your programs and settings using either a Time Machine backup or Migration Assistant.

       " ' LinkedIn may be useful for helping professionals research and connect with others in their industry, but Relationship Science hopes to go a step further by showing users how to connect with top influencers who may not even have a social media presence. The service, which launched earlier this week, provides a comprehensive database of profiles to map out how each user\\'s interests and contacts could connect them to more than two million \"influential decision-makers\" across finance, business and non-profit industries. If you want to get in touch with an executive at a hedge fund or just find a good contact at a particular venture firm, Relationship Science will help you find the right go-between person to build a relationship with in order to make the proper introduction.  Unlike LinkedIn, the profiles on Relationship Science are not user-generated. Instead, they are the product of large-scale data collection as well as careful research from 700 employees who work at the New York City-based startup. The team has spent the better part of two and a half years researching prominent organizations and the people associated with them, mapping out the professional careers of these individuals, including their investments, personal interests, clients they\\'ve advised and even their family members. In this way, Relationship Service hopes to surface real-world connections that might not be represented on social networks. \"We\\'re going a lot deeper than what someone would post on a profile on LinkedIn, and the coverage of people is quite different,\" Neal Goldman, founder of Relationship Science, told Mashable. \"We did a little study and found that over 50% of people in our database are not active users of a social network.\" The service doesn\\'t come cheap: Relationship Science charges users $3,000 a year, though it\\'s really intended more as a tool for execs and entrepreneurs than as a product for casual job hunters.  Goldman previously founded CapitalIQ, a financial data firm, which made use of similar data collection techniques and was eventually sold to McGraw-Hill for $200 million.  Perhaps based on this history, Goldman and his team managed to raise just under $60 million in funding for Relationship Science from some big names including Ken Langone, Henry Kravis and the Hearst Corporation. This has allowed the startup to bring on 550 full-time employees and 250 contract workers.  While it\\'s still early days for the company and its product, Goldman believes the method his service uses does a better job of mapping relationships between influencers and users than any traditional social network.  \"Once you map all of that, you start to see who people know and how they interrelate,\" he says. \"There\\'s not another database in the world that would say, \\'Person A\\'s daughter is married to person B\\'s son.\\'\"  Who knows, perhaps Relationship Science will prove once and for all that we really are just a few steps removed from anyone, even the most influential people in the world.

       " ' The paw prints and hoof prints of a few meddlesome animals have been preserved for posterity on ancient Roman tiles recently discovered by archaeologists in England. \"They are beautiful finds, as they represent a snapshot, a single moment in history,\" said Nick Daffern, a senior project manager with Wardell Armstrong Archaeology. \"It is lovely to imagine some irate person chasing a dog or some other animal away from their freshly made tiles.\" The artifacts, which could be nearly 2,000 years old, were found in the Blackfriars area of Leicester, the English city where the long-lost bones of King Richard III were discovered under a parking lot in 2012. Wardell Armstrong Archaeology was brought in to dig at a site where a construction company plans to build student housing. SEE ALSO: Photos of Animal Prints on Ancient Roman Tiles  At least one of the tiles is tainted with dog paw prints, and one is marked with the hoof prints of a sheep or a goat that trampled on the clay before it was dry. \"My initial thought was that it must have been very difficult being a Roman tile manufacturer with these animal incursions going on all the time,\" Philip Briggs, another Wardell Armstrong archaeologist, told Live Science in an email. The tiles were found in layers of rubble that had been laid down as a hard base for subsequent floors, but the artifacts\\' original context is unclear, Daffern said. \"We don\\'t know if the tiles were originally part of an earlier building or were bought in from elsewhere specifically to raise and stabilize ground,\" Daffern told Live Science in an email. Leicester was the stronghold of an Iron Age group known as the Corieltauvi tribe, and it remained an important city after the Roman conquest of Britain in the first century A.D., as it was located along the Fosse Way, a Roman road that connected southwestern England with the East Midlands. The excavators say that, in addition to the animal-printed tiles, they\\'ve uncovered Roman tweezers, brooches, coins and painted wall plaster. They\\'ve also unearthed traces of a large Roman building — perhaps a basilica, with a peristyle, or columned porch — that was largely robbed of its masonry during the medieval era for other construction projects. The archaeologists even discovered late Iron Age artifacts, such as several fragments of clay molds that the Corieltauvi tribe likely used to make coins before the Roman rule. Daffern said it\\'s rare to find sites with coin molds, given how closely managed coin production would have been during the Iron Age. \"I think the excavation thus far has significantly multiplied the number of coin mold fragments recovered from Leicester, probably by approximately tenfold,\" Daffern said in an email. The excavation is funded by construction company Watkin Jones. The archaeologists are providing updates on Wardell Armstrong Archaeology\\'s blog.

       " '    \\'Temple Run 2\\'        Title Screen Welcome to \\'Temple Run 2,\\' released a little more than a year after the original blockbuster game.          Swipe Controls Temple Run 2 features the same swipe controls as the original, making the gameplay easy for anyone to pick up.          Beautiful Scenery This new game is a huge graphical improvement over the original Temple Run. The world is set on a floating temple, and the game takes place just before sunset; the clouds look like sherbet.           New Obstacles The game has far more obstacles than before, so you\\'ll be jumping and ducking a variety of natural and dangerous formations.          Swinging Want to feel like Tarzan? Temple Run 2 loves sending you down zip lines and over vines.          Minecart Madness You\\'ll also have to tilt the phone to stay on these rickety minecart tracks, another new feature.          Monkey Monster Instead of running from a horde of angry monkeys, your new monkey foe is huge, and scary. Don\\'t let him catch you!          Need More Gems After each death, Temple Run 2 offers you the option to revive and not lose your spot in your run. You can do this if you\\'ve snagged a gem during your runs, but you can also purchase them from the store.          Store The game\\'s store has a multitude of coin purchase options to get new characters and power-ups earlier, as well as gems to revive your character.          Abilities You can level up your character\\'s abilities with the coins you collect.          Achievements Just like Temple Run, you level up your character by completing objectives in-game.          Clever Death Page You\\'ll also get different messages at the end of your run, depending on how you died.          New Characters Each Temple Run 2 character includes his or her own special power than can be activated during runs.        While many may say, \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it,\" this is not true for Temple Run 2. The original was a smash hit, downloaded more than 170 million times across iOS and Android devices, but there remained a lot to be improved upon in the game. Temple Run 2 [iTunes link] represents those improvements, proving that the development team of Imangi Studios took a lot of time to add more depth into this mega-addictive endless runner.  First off, the game is far more beautiful than its predecessor. Imangi cofounder Keith Shepherd said they added two members to the team specifically to make Temple Run 2 as beautiful as possible. The effort paid off: The game takes place in as lush of a game world as you can get on an iPhone, and it definitely takes advantage of Retina displays. The cloud-swathed, floating temple is surrounded by the pink sky of the \"golden hour\" that occurs before sunset.  The environments are also more varied, along with the obstacles. As soon as you start mastering the early terrain, Temple Run 2 switches it up on you, driving you deeper into dense woods full of ill-placed spike traps. Further down still is a perilous mine shaft, and you\\'ll have to keep racing through to escape. Each area is interesting and full of nicely illustrated detail. Even the menacing monkey chasing you has benefitted from a graphical upgrade. Instead of a pack of tiny primates, you\\'re now being chased by one giant ape. Seeing his figure behind you as you race and turn is good motivation to keep going. While many things have improved, the simple control scheme didn\\'t, and that\\'s a great thing. The best thing about the Temple Run franchise is it\\'s easy to pick up, yet hard to master the game. It\\'s the key to what made the original such a success, and it will help propel the second to great heights. Temple Run 2 also beefed up the characters available to the player. Shepherd said they found there were enough fans who wanted a real differentiation between all the avatars, so the developer obliged by adding different power-ups to each. They don\\'t add as much depth to the gameplay as advertised, but still are nice for players who favor one character over another. The characters and power-ups can all be purchased with real money as well as in-game currency. This is something we\\'ve come to expect from freemium games. My one gripe, representative of the freemium formula being taken too far in Temple Run 2, is how the game handles your eventual death. Now, when your character falls off the edge or smacks his head into a wall, a small dialogue box appears, crying \"Save Me!\" Reviving your character costs one gem, and while they are sporadically available as you race through the game, five can be purchased for just 99 cents. It\\'s an easy way to cheat death, but it could also easily be an addictive way to stretch your runs just a little farther. Just let me buy the game for a dollar so I don\\'t have to see this, please? Despite this drawback, I can see Temple Run 2 reaching the same success as the first game based on its improvements. I\\'m looking forward to seeing every mobile screen on New York\\'s subway taken up by this game — a real sign of its success.  For the price (free), iOS gamers cannot skip this one.

       " ' Award-winning director Mike Nicholsdied suddenly on Wednesday evening at age 83. During his career, which spanned more than 50 years, Nichols helmed films that became cultural icons.  He was among the very few to take home all four major awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.   Director Mike Nichols on June 9, 2010.Image: Matt Sayles/Associated PressSome of Hollywood\\'s most beloved and respected actors collaborated with Nichols, who married Diana Sawyer in 1988. Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Julia Roberts are just a few of the big names who have worked alongside the EGOT director and producer.  Here\\'s the work that will keep his memory alive forever. Big-screen work Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Wolf? Nichols’ reflections on American life offered up some of the most memorable films and plays of the past five decades. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolf, released in 1966, was well-received by critics and, with iconic performances from powerhouses Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, has stood the test of time.  As Nichols’ directorial screen debut, the movie put him on the map. Prior to the film, Nichols was on the radar as a stage director but had yet to crack Hollywood. \"The most pressing question — since we already know a great deal about the play and the two stars — is the direction,\" wrote Stanley Kauffmann in a 1966 review for the New York Times. \"Mike Nichols, after a brilliant and too-brief career as a satirist, proved to be a brilliant theatrical director of comedy.\"  The Graduate The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffmann and Anne Bancroft, defined youth culture of the 1960’s and ingrained itself in American pop-culture for decades after. Mike Nichols was still under the radar in Hollywood in 1967 and producer Lawrence Turman told Vanity Fair, “No one thought the book was funny, and no one in Hollywood had even heard of Mike Nichols.” That was all about to change. When The Graduate was released in 1967, Nichols’ work \"sent tremors through the industry,” according to Peter Biskind in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex, Drugs and Rock-\\'n\\'-Roll Generation Saved Hollywood.  It also launched the career of a young Dustin Hoffman.   Angels in America In 2003, Nichols\\' directed the HBO miniseries adaptation of Angels in America, a Pulitzer-prize winning play by Tony Kushner that unpacked the AIDS crisis in America in the 80s. It starred heavyweights Meryl Streep, Al Pacino and Emma Thompson in memorable roles. Critic Nancy Franklin lauded Nichols\\' translation of such a culturally important play to the screen. \"Nichols has tied the thematic bigness of Angels together with the specificity of its story line,\" wrote Franklin at the time.  Working Girl Already a seasoned director by the time Working Girl debuted in 1988, Nichols again delivered a classic, which 26 year later still resonates. Melanie Griffith’s character, Tess McGill, became synonymous with the working woman of the time, struggling in a male-dominated world. She also dished out some memorable lines like, \"I have a head for business and a bod for sin.\"  Charlie Wilson\\'s War The 2007 movie staring Tom Hanks offered a fresh take on congressman Charlie Wilson\\'s outspoken support of Afghanistan during its 1980s war with Russia.  New York Times film critic A.O. Scott applauded Nichols\\' use of humor the film. \"If it’s the best politically themed movie to come around in a while, that may be because the director, Mike Nichols, and the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, grasp that politics, for all its seriousness, is an essentially comic undertaking,\" wrote Scott.   The Birdcage Nichols directed The Birdcage in 1996, a remake of the French musical La Cage aux Folles, that reimagined the story in South Beach, Miami. Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest starred and, again, reviews singled out Nichols\\' comic genius as the driving force behind the film\\'s success. \"Mr. Nichols puts his film through these paces with dependable comic agility, and rises to the requisite frantic pitch when the two families meet for dinner,\" wrote film critic Janet Maslin.   Nichols on Broadway \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1964) While Nichols wow-ed film audiences with relevant stories that resonated with the culture of the times, his stage direction laid the foundation for his career. Nichols\\' direction of the romantic comedy \"Barefoot in the Park\" by Neil Simon won him a Tony award in 1964. The play, starring Robert Redford, went on to become the tenth longest-running non-musical play in Broadway history before it closed in 1967.  Robert Redford\\'s smiles on stage in \"Barefoot in the Park.\" The comedy about a pair of newlyweds was one of the biggest hits of the 1964 season on Broadway. \"The Odd Couple\" (1965) Nichols won another Tony for his work with Neil Simon\\'s material — he directed \"The Odd Couple\" in 1965.  The cast starred Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison and Art Carney as Felix Ungar. The role became a defining one for Matthau and launched his Broadway career. \"Director Mike Nichols has staged an absolute summer festival of warm beer, sprayed toward the ceiling like those terraced fountains municipal designers are so fond of, and I suppose we can credit author Neil Simon with providing the sandwiches,\" wrote Walter Kerr in his 1965 review.  Actors Art Carney (L) and Walter Matthau performing in Neil Simon\\'s play, The Odd Couple, March 1, 1965.\"Plaza Suite\" (1968) Another Neil Simon play, \"Plaza Suite,\" added yet another Tony award to Nichols\\' growing collection. The play ran for over a thousand performances on Broadway, and while Nichols did not direct the film adaptation, his stage direction was warmly received.  Actress Barbara Bel Geddes in a scene from stock production of Neil Simon\\'s comedy Plaza Suite, Jan. 1, 1969.Image: Ray Fisher/The LIFE Images Collection\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (1972) Yet another black comedy by Neil Simon, \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue,\" follows the unravelling lives of a middle-aged couple living on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side. Nichols\\' stage direction was recognized with a Tony in 1972.   Jack Lemmon clutches a shovel while Anne Bancroft talks on the phone in a scene from the film \\'The Prisoner Of Second Avenue\\', 1975.Image: Warner Brothers\"Annie\" (1977) Nichols\\' directed the original Broadway production of \"Annie\" in 1977, bringing the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie to life onstage. The show ran for over 2,000 performances and has been revived numerous times since. The original production was nominated for eleven Tony awards that year, taking home seven.   Actor Reid Shelton is shown in costume as Oliver \"Daddy\" Warbucks with Andrea Mcardle as \"Annie\" in this Feb. 24, 1977 file photo. \"The Real Thing\" (1984) Set in the early 1980s, Tom Stoppard\\'s \"The Real Thing\" is a play-within-a-play drama which examined marriage and art as it follows the story of an actress and a soldier. The New York Times review of the play honed in on Nichols as a driving force behind its initial success. \"Given the sublime cast led by Mr. Irons and Glenn Close — and the bravura force of Mike Nichols\\'s direction — any repeat viewings are likely to be as dazzling as the first,\" wrote Frank Rich in the New York Times.  Mike Nichols and Annabelle Nichols during \\'The Real Thing\\' Broadway Opening Night - After Party at Tavern on the Green in New York City, New York, Jan. 5 1984.Image: Ron GalellaArthur Miller\\'s \"Death of a Salesman\" (2012) The 2012 revival of \"Death of a Salesman\" starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann and Andrew Garfield won the Tony Award for best revival of a play. Nichols\\' work was warmly received by critics and was called \"thunderous\" in a Vulture review. His direction was largely seen as true to the first production of Miller\\'s iconic play.  Mike Nichols stands with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Andrew Garfield and the cast of \\'Death of a Salesman\\' at the 66th Annual Tony Awards at The Beacon Theatre on June 10, 2012 in New York City. \"Monty Python\\'s Spamalot\" (2005) A more modern example of Nichols\\' comedic genius was seen in his direction of a 2005 stage adaptation of Monty Python\\'s \"Spamalot.\" Critic Ben Brantley  voiced surprise at the choice of Nichols, who he called a \"venerable master of slickness,\"as director of the musical. However, Nichols pulled off a \"resplendently silly\" production, according to Brantley.

       " ' A man who had recently traveled to a West African country is in \"strict isolation\" at New York City\\'s Mount Sinai Hospital after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, but doctors now say they don\\'t think he has the deadly virus. \"Odds are this is not Ebola,\" said Dr. Jeremy Boal, Mount Sinai\\'s chief medical officer, at a Monday evening press conference. He said he hoped that a more common cause for the man\\'s fever would be found later on Monday or early Tuesday morning. See also: 6 Questions About Ebola, Answered The man went to the hospital\\'s emergency room in the early morning hours on Monday with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, Mount Sinai spokeswoman Johanna Younghans said in an emailed statement. The patient reported traveling to a West African country where Ebola has been spreading — the hospital wouldn\\'t say which country due to privacy concerns — and is now in isolation. The patient is undergoing tests to determine the cause of his symptoms. \"All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff. We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients,\" the spokeswoman said. “We are on a heightened state of alert,” Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation told The New York Times. “We have instructed all 11 of our hospitals to follow C.D.C. guidelines and be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms.” Last week, another man who had traveled to West Africa was isolated at a New York City hospital after exhibiting symptoms consistent with the virus, but Ebola was ruled out after his fever dissipated. The Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever that has stricken more than 1,600 people in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and now Nigeria. At least 887 people have died.  The virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or urine, unlike an airborne virus like influenza or the common cold. It can take up to 21 days for a person exposed to the virus to exhibit any symptoms, making it possible for infected travelers to enter the U.S. without knowing they have it. One American aid worker is in an Atlanta-area hospital with Ebola, and another is on her way there, after both contracted the disease in Liberia. They are said to be improving.

       " ' Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled a smartphone, an extension of the company\\'s Kindle Fire line of tablets, at an event in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday. Called the Fire Phone, the smartphone will launch on July 25 (preorders begin now) and will be exclusive to AT&T in the U.S. It will cost $199.99 for a 32GB version and $299.99 for 64GB, with a two-year contract. AT&T customers can also buy the phone contract-free via the carrier\\'s Next program, for no money down and 24 monthly payments of $27. See also: Amazon\\'s Firefly Feature Scans the World Around You, and Lets You Buy It Customers will also be able to buy Fire Phone unlocked directly from Amazon for $649. A year of Amazon Prime membership is included with purchase whether you buy from AT&T or Amazon. The device also includes the Kindle Owner\\'s Lending Library, the only smartphone to do so.  The 4.7-inch device boasts a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, an Adreno 339 graphics processor and 2GB of RAM. It runs Amazon\\'s custom version of Android, called Fire OS, and the design has Gorilla Glass on both the front and the back. As predicted, the Fire Phone\\'s display is capable of display 3D images. Amazon calls the technology Dynamic Perspective, with a 3D effect that adds the illusion of depth behind the screen, rather than outward. The phone uses four special front-facing cameras, all with a wide field of view, to detect where the user\\'s head is at all times, Bezos said. Every camera is equipped with an infrared light so the Fire Phone\\'s 3D effect should work even in low-light conditions. Bezos demonstrated how the 3D display could be used to browse and shop. By tilting the phone a certain way, a user can move from one item to the next. The same feature can also scroll through web pages without touching the display. Amazon said it would make a software development kit (SDK) for the Dynamic Perspective available, so app developers will be able to design their apps to work with the display, which could be particularly useful for games. One of the standout features of the Fire Phone is that it offers free, unlimited photo storage on the Amazon Cloud (videos are not included) for pictures captured by the 13-megapixel camera. Amazon is clearly leveraging its strength in cloud services to its smartphone photo experience.  Image:  Mashable,  Christina AscaniAnother new feature: Firefly, which lets you scan any product, even music and TV shows playing in the background (à la Shazam) and bring you information on them from Amazon.com. The feature, which is activated via a dedicated physical button, works with restaurant signs and phone numbers, too. MyFitnessPal is integrated with Firefly to provide nutritional information on food. Amazon includes its May Day service with the Fire Phone for no extra charge, extending the popular instant-customer-service app that it introduced with the Kindle Fire HDX tablets. The Fire Phone has special features for video and music, too. The phone has the ability to \"fling\" content to another devices, such as Amazon\\'s Fire TV, and Xbox or a PlayStation. The phone will also have predictive caching, which predicts what you\\'re going to stream next. Prime Music will have the \"x-ray\" feature to provide real-time lyrics for songs.  For reading, the phone\\'s WhisperSync feature will work with voice. That means you can listen to an audio version of the book while, say, driving, then continue where you left off on a Kindle or Kindle app. The Fire Phone also includes special headphones equipped with magnets, which supposedly help prevent them from getting tangled up in pockets. Rumors surrounding an Amazon phone have circulated for years, but the first credible reports began months ago, saying the company was working on a mobile device with a special 3D-capable screen. More recently, AT&T was reported to be the exclusive partner for the phone in the U.S., and that Amazon\\'s secretive hardware company, Lab126, had been working on the phone for almost five years. The history of 3D-type screens in mobile suggests consumers aren\\'t interested in the feature. The two most notable devices, the HTC Evo 3D and the LG Optimus 3D, both flopped. The only real 3D success in mobile so far has been the Nintendo 3DS, which is explicitly a game console. Samantha Murphy Kelly contributed reporting to this story.

He added that Clippers coach Doc Rivers \"kind of knows that’s a project\":  \"It\\'s one of the first things he said to me: \\'We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren’t we?\\' And I said, \\'Yeah, we probably are.\\' But I promised we would do it during the off season.\" See also: Life After Microsoft: Steve Ballmer, Motivational Speaker Exactly how far the Apple sentiment extends, we don\\'t yet know — but it\\'s not likely that Clippers stars such as Chris Paul or Blake Griffin would have to turn in their iPhones any time soon.  If the Clippers coaching staff uses iPads on the sidelines to look at replays and strategize, however, those could well be an endangered species, set to be replaced by Microsoft Surface tablets, which Ballmer introduced towards the end of his tenure at Microsoft. Ballmer is such a loyalist, according to Reuters, that he\\'s banned his family from using iPhones.  The NBA isn\\'t the only sports battleground in the war between iPad and Surface tablets. Microsoft struck a multiyear deal with the NFL this season, one that provided all teams with Surfaces at an estimated cost of $400 million.  But that didn\\'t stop football announcers from calling the devices iPads every time they pop up on camera, as the LA Times pointed out. Should that kind of commentary mistake happen during a Clippers game in the new Surface era, don\\'t be surprised to see Ballmer turn his ire on ESPN. ',\n",

       " ' LONDON — Biologists in Scotland were struck by an unusual discovery this week: ice pancakes the size of dinner plates floating on the River Dee.  More common to the Antarctic or Baltic Seas, they need rare conditions to form, and this is the first time they\\'ve been found on the UK river. They were spotted by biologist Jamie Urquhart on the Lummels Pool at Birse, which is 29 miles from Aberdeen.  See also: 10 most clichéd tweets about the weather  Image: Facebook River DeeThe pancakes were likely formed after foam floating on the water began to freeze at night. As the frozen foam swirled around the eddy, or current of water, they became circular.  \"Perhaps each disc grew when smaller pieces of unfrozen foam struck the disc, adhered and then froze in place,\" the River Dee Trust said in a blog post published Wednesday.   Image: Facebook River DeeThe inner lines of the ice pancakes were likely formed by the fluctuating air temperature between day and night.  \"The air temperature was colder at night due to the clear-sky conditions, but warmer in the day, meaning the discs may have grown at night,\" the trust said. \"Then during the day, when the discs softened in the sun, further collisions between the \\'pancakes\\' caused the rims to be pushed up.\" The River Dee, designated as an area of special conservation, provides a habitat for freshwater pearl mussel, Atlantic salmon and otter. It stretches 87 miles from the Cairngorm Mountains to Aberdeen, where it meets with the North Sea.  ',\n",

Price: $9.99 for iOS   Image: Inkling         2. Eat Sleep: Simple Baby Tracking   Exactly how many diapers do babies go through when they’re newborns? It might seem mundane to be tracking diapers, but what you’re really tracking is output (and intake). Weight gain is crucial, and for nursing moms, especially, dirty and wet diapers are the only indication that babies are eating enough. Eat Sleep Tracker not only keeps tabs on diaper changes, but feeding times and sleep patterns, too. Price: Free for iOS; Feed Baby is similar for Android    Image: BitMethod         3. Best Baby Monitor   If you have an extra iOS device lying around, you can create an insta-baby monitor using this app. With one device in the nursery and one as the parent unit, Best Baby Monitor provides real-time video and audio of your baby using the same Wi-Fi network. You can even record those cute gurgles and coos and talk to your baby through the phone to shhh her back to a sound slumber.  Price: $3.99 for iOS   Image: Best Baby Monitor         4. Baby Soother   Speaking of sleep, any magical tips to actually get a baby to fall asleep are always welcomed by parents. People assume that the house has to be museum quiet when baby is sleeping, but in reality, the womb was quite noisy. Sound Sleeper is a great app to fill the silence with options such as ocean waves, white noise, hair dryer, vacuum and more. Price: Free for Android   Image: Appy-Now         5. BabyBook   Babies go through so many firsts, each more exciting than the last. BabyBook is a terrific app that lets you document all these milestones and preserve memories from your baby’s everyday life. With easy-to-use templates, you can seamlessly fill up a book of moments from your mobile device that you can share with family and friends, and even print into a hardcover book.

Price: Free for iOS and Android   Image: JaguArt         7. Joya Video   With a baby in the house, nearly every moment seems worth recording. But that two minute-long video of your baby adorably trying to roll over is too long to send -- or is it? With Joya, there is no video clip too large to send to family, friends, relatives and anyone else who would be interested. The app sends the video via email or text, and recipients can view the clip with a private link. Now, everyone can marvel at how your baby rolls. Price: Free for iOS; coming soon to Google Play   Image: Joya         8. Shuttersong   In addition to those videos, Grandma and Grandpa are probably asking for photos on a daily basis, too. Shuttersong lets you do that, but with a very fun twist. You can record audio to accompany any photo and bundle them in a little package to share via social media, email or text. It’s perfect for pairing those sweet little baby coos with that sweet baby face. Price: Free for iOS   Image: Shuttersong         9. Amazon   Personally, this is the app that I use the most (sometimes multiple times a day) and it still occupies me during those middle-of-the-night feedings. Whether it’s purchasing diapers, wipes, mattress covers, pacifiers, warmer sleepers, teethers or bottles, anything you need for baby you’ll find on Amazon. Some of your best shopping can be done at 2 a.m., and with a Prime membership, it’s at your door two days later. Price: Free for iOS, Android, Kindle and Windows 8   Image: Amazon         10. Umano   With a new baby in the house, it can be difficult to find time to read for pleasure, let alone stay on top of current headlines. With Umano, the app that actually reads the news to you, you can still be feeding, burping, changing or bathing the baby while keeping up with current events. And with its use of professional voice actors, you’ll feel like it’s your own personal story time. Price: Free for iOS and Android   Image: Umano       The first months of having a baby are rough, regardless of whether you are a repeat parent, like me, or a rookie just entering the exhilarating and exhausting fray. In those newborn months and even through the first year, most weary-eyed parents go into survival mode, yet miraculously adapt to all of the challenges that come with the transition.

The satellite provider will begin offering DogTV for $5.99 a month in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg. The channel broadcasts content is aimed at canines and includes \"scenes with and without other animals, animation sequences and a variety of moving objects,” according to DogTV. Relaxation segments on the channel also show sleeping dogs and some nature scenes accompanied by soothing music. Such programming, developed using scientific studies and advice from trainers, is already available via the Internet for $9.99 a month. Cox customers in California can also get Dog TV programming for $4.99 a month. However, the DirecTV deal, with its access to 20 million new potential viewers, offers the biggest audience yet for the 1-year-old startup.  Next up: DogTV may offer a similar channel for cats. Founder Ron Levi told the BBC last year that cats have been spotting watching the programming too, so that might be a natural area for expansion.  Image courtesy of YouTube, DogTV ',\n",

       " ' [Update: Mashable got the inside scoop on this patent and \"Apple’s Smart Pen Patent Is Not What You Think\"] While there has been lots of buzz over a potential Apple smartwatch, a new patent shows the company is also thinking about other kinds of portable computers. It reveals a computer embedded within a standard pen, which has a small LCD screen for displaying emails, texts, alerts, etc. The abstract notes: A portable computer arranged to rest comfortably in the hand has a small display screen. Accelerometers capable of detecting movement of the pen with respect to gravity provide input to a microcontroller which selects a response from a number of viewing modes. The pen may be held in either hand and the output message to the screen will be oriented according to the location of the pen. Full personal digital assistance functionality may be incorporated in a relatively small plastics casing and functions, such as calendar, contacts the like may be incorporated.  CNET reports that the device would be equipped with cellular and/or GPS technology for wireless communication, along with a microphone, speaker, and rechargeable battery. Along with other functions such as a calculator and clock, the device could also be used as a PDA or portable word processor, with handwriting recognition and voice input. The handwriting recognition wouldn’t require the user to write on a surface, instead they could simply move it around as if writing letters and numbers in mid-air.

       " ' Students at one New Jersey high school could face child pornography charges if found in possession of nude photos of classmates.  Explicit images sent via Snapchat prompted a police investigation after two freshman girls shared pictures on the controversial app and later found them posted on Instagram. The Ridgewood High School students sent photos to at least one male classmate who took screenshots in order to save them to a gallery.  In a letter to parents on Wednesday, Superintendent Daniel Fishbein said school officials were working in conjunction with local police to educate the community about \"legal and psychosocial implications of this activity.\" Fishbein shared the letter with students in sixth through twelfth grade to address the app\\'s popular use among middle schoolers.  SEE ALSO: Hacker Finds Easy Way to Secretly Save SnapChat Pictures  Snapchat has gained a reputation for being a sext-friendly app, allowing users to take racy photos that automatically delete a few seconds after being sent. Under New Jersey law, creating, transmitting or possessing these sexually explicit images falls under child pornography and \"Endangering the Welfare of Children.\"  Police are implementing an amnesty period for students in possession of photos, but after March 18 students can be prosecuted for the crime. The period gives parents the opportunity to teach their children about responsible use of the apps.  One mother of a high school student in a neighboring town said many parents restrict their kids\\' social media use on sites like Facebook, or ban it altogether.  \"They have no idea their kids are using Snapchat and Instagram, I don\\'t even think they know what those are,\" she tells Mashable.  It\\'s not the first time teens have faced such consequences. In 2009, an 18-year-old became a registered sex offender after vengefully sending a naked photo of his 16-year-old girlfriend to friends and family. The same year, six Pennsylvania high school students faced child pornography charges after girls allegedly took nude photos and \"sexted\" them to male classmates.

       " ' Intel\\'s upcoming processors, codenamed \"Haswell,\" have an integrated \"Iris\" graphics chip that will deliver twice the performance of the Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip, integrated in the current \"Ivy Bridge\" processor line.  This means laptops sporting Haswell chips — which will be launched under Intel\\'s \"Core\" brand — will have decent video playback and gaming capabilities, even without a dedicated graphics chip.   For example, laptops running on Haswell chips will be able to play 4K (3840×2160 pixels) video; they\\'ll have faster MPEG encoding and decoding capabilities thanks to Intel\\'s improved QuickSync technology, and their 3D Mark scores are as much as doubled compared to machines running Ivy Bridge chips.   Not all Haswell CPUs will be created equal, though. Intel will have several tiers of integrated graphics in 2013 — energy-savvy ultrabooks will mostly have the Intel HD Graphics 5000 chip, while bigger laptops will carry either the new Iris or Iris Pro chip.  For users who don\\'t want a huge gaming laptop, but still want decent performance when it comes to video playback and gaming, this is great news.  Right now, many laptop makers (Apple\\'s MacBook Pro is one example) resort to having both integrated and dedicated graphics chips in some configurations, with the dedicated graphics turning on as needed. If Intel\\'s upcoming chips deliver on the promise of vastly upgraded graphics performance, the integrated graphics chips might finally become good enough for everyone who\\'s not a hardcore gamer.  Intel hasn\\'t shared all the details about the new chips yet; we\\'ll likely find out more about them at this year\\'s Computex, which takes place in Taipei, Taiwan, June 4-8.

The makers behind this circus maximus want to inspire the youth to pursue careers in the sci-tech world. It\\'s like a World\\'s Fair for the iPhone set. “We’ve found that high-tech games spark curiosity about engineering and science, so we created the STEAM Carnival to inspire the next generation of inventors,” explains Eric Gradman, Two Bit\\'s\\xa0CTO and co-founder.

That means you\\'re going to see roboticists, scientists, engineers, designers all coming alive in an old-fashioned big tent at a fairground near you, if the project gets the needed funding. The carnival will begin in spring 2014 in Los Angeles and San Francisco and is polling users to see what city they should hit next. If things go as planned, STEAM will keep its kid-friendly focus and showcase its creations via competitions, digital art galleries, a musical robot concert, and a fashion with wearable electronics.

See also: A Harry Potter Mystery Has Finally Been Solved The new covers focus on pivotal scenes in the books and provide more detailed landscapes of key plot locations like Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. The new Deathly Hallows cover depicts Harry, Ron and Hermoine escaping from Gringotts Wizarding Bank on the back of a dragon. The original U.S. covers, illustrated by Marie GrandPre, generally just focused on the Harry Potter character. GrandPre\\'s drawings will continue to be featured on printed U.S. editions, but the new covers will be sold in a special box set available on Aug. 27th.  Kibuishi also redesigned the artwork on the spines of the books. When the full box set is placed in order, it will reveal a sweeping image of Hogwarts at night. Scholastic will continue to unveil one new design per day for the next week of the updated back covers of the books.

       " '     Understanding the conflict in Iraq begins with the knowledge that—in a very general sense—the three main population groups are Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds. Although no reliable census exists, surveys suggest that Shiites make up the biggest part of the population. Shiites control the national government and the security forces, and are mostly located in the south. Sunni Arabs reside predominantly in the west. And the Kurds control a semi-autonomous region in the north. See also: 9 Essential Questions About Iraq, Answered However, this conflict isn\\'t just about geography. To clarify the complex situation, we’ve broken down its major players.  The insurgents: ISIL The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (known as ISIL or sometimes ISIS) is the radical Sunni group grabbing the headlines. Once affiliated with al-Qaida, they are essentially a militia with a base force of 10,000 soldiers who now control large swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq.  Demonstrators chant pro-al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as they wave al-Qaida flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Baghdad on June 16. Image: AP Photo, File/Associated PressThe group\\'s leader is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who took over al-Qaida\\'s Iraqi branch from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi when Zarqawi was killed by the U.S. in 2006. Under his direction, the insurgents\\' ambitions have grown. Their keenest desire is now to establish an extremist Sunni caliphate that would span a large swath of territory in region.  Sunni militias The rebels currently sweeping through the country are radical Sunnis who have made allegiances with local groups who feel oppressed by the Shiite government. ISIL’s strength wouldn’t be as great without the help of those militant groups, which include former Baathists who lost power when Saddam Hussein was ousted.  Baathists  Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was the leader of the Baath Party. He\\'s pictured here during his trial in Baghdad, Iraq on Jan. 29, 2006. Image: Darko Bandic/Associated PressMembers of the once-ruling Baath Party have deep cultural roots in northern Iraq from where they have helped solidify ISIL’s military advance. The Baathists are more secular-minded, but they share a common enemy with the extremists: the Shiite government in Baghdad.    The Iraqi government The Iraqi government is dominated by Shia politicians and largely devoid of any Sunni influence, and its general disdain for Sunnis is a big reason why rebel groups have gained so much traction. The Iraqi government is also friendly with (many would say under the influence of) the predominantly Shia government of Iran. If there is a single person to blame for the systematic removal of Sunnis and Kurds from the Iraqi government and its armed forces, it is Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.   Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki meets with Iran\\'s former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in Tehran, Iran on Dec. 5, 2013. Image: Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated PressMaliki has been in charge since 2006 and was called a \"good man\" by former United States President George W. Bush in 2007. However, the White House has recently called for him to step down, as the U.S. administration does not believe he will be able to reconcile the differences between the nation\\'s warring factions.  Iraqi security forces Prime Minister Maliki began pushing Sunnis and Kurds out of the military a few years ago, replacing them with Shiites he knew would remain loyal. Experts say Iraqi security forces have become a largely sectarian militia.  Shiite militias If ISIS and other Sunni rebels decide to advance farther south, they will encounter Shiite militias willing to fight fiercely to defend their home turf in the south.   Shiite tribal fighters raise their weapons and chant slogans against the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Basra, Iraq\\'s second-largest city, on June 15, 2014. Image: Nabil Al-Jurani/Associated PressMany of these groups are unfriendly to the United States, having fought against American forces in the Iraq War. They are well-armed and experienced fighters. Some of these armed groups are also backed by Iran, a Shiite nation, which has a vested interest in ensuring that its neighbor Iraq remains under Shiite control.  Two religious figures wield considerable influence over Shiite militias.  The first is Muqtada al-Sadr, a 40-year-old cleric who led a powerful militia against U.S. troops during the Iraq War and recently proclaimed he was forming a group of fighters to defend territory in the southern part of the nation that Shiites consider holy.   Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr casts his vote at a polling station in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraq on April 30. Image: Jaber al-Helo/Associated PressThe second is Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, the nation\\'s top Shiite cleric, who preached nonviolence in response to Sunni attacks during the Iraq War. That said, he recently called for Shiites to fight the encroaching Sunni rebels.    Two Iraqi women walk past a portrait of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, center, in Baghdad, Iraq on  Jan. 13, 2004Image: Muhammed Muheisen/Associated PressKurds The Kurds are an ethnic group who live in several countries in the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Turkey. The Kurds, whose fighters are known as the pesh merga, have long fought for a nation of their own.  Right now, the Kurds have a tenuous alliance with the Shiite government. That said, this alliance is delicate and could shift as the conflict develops in the coming days and weeks.  Just as the Baathist alliance with Sunni rebels is based on a common enemy, so is the Kurdish alliance with the Iraqi government. Reports suggest that the pesh merga are coordinating with the Iraqi government to fight Sunni rebels, but those two sides have long been at odds, and any military success they achieve together could result in further territorial disputes between the two sides later on.

       " ' Chicago\\'s Chief Information Officer Brett Goldstein fundamentally believes the secret to a smarter and more responsive city lies in finding meaning in the vast quantity of data cities collect about themselves. \"I would argue cities are ecosystems, that\\'s not really something that\\'s new that people would say,\" Goldstein told Mashable. \"I would further argue that within the ecosystem there are a series of smaller ecosystems, neighborhoods and what have you, and by understanding how things happen and how they move forward and evolve, we\\'re able to start making smarter decisions. We start to get more in the business of prevention rather than reacting.\" Goldstein is at the helm of developing the SmartChicago Analytics Platform, a dashboard that will give Chicago\\'s decision makers a look at myriad data aggregated from across the city\\'s departments. At the core of the platform is an innovative idea: detecting important patterns in mountains of data in real time. The SmartChicago Analytics Platform is among twenty ideas vying for a $5 million grand prize or four $1 million runners-up prizes being awarded by Bloomberg Philanthropies\\' Mayor\\'s Challenge, a competition to \"inspire American cities to generate innovative ideas that solve major challenges and improve city life.\"  What\\'s the practical advantage of such pattern detection for a city government? \"Let\\'s say for example within the next hour we\\'re about to have a massive rainstorm,\" said Goldstein. \"Certain parts of the city under certain circumstances will experience flooding. Now imagine if you\\'re able to take all of your historical work orders for water response coupled with all of the weather data coupled with all the seasonality data and predict under these circumstances, with these co-variants, on this day in this month, with these events, these are the areas that are most likely to have a problem.  \"You have two things that are immediately beneficial there: one, where should I stage my resources so they can respond faster and help our constituency faster? But at the same time, as you model these circumstances, you can say this is an area where I can potentially make an infrastructure investment. So it\\'s leveraging all that information and making a smart choice in the moment, but it\\'s also a combination of tactical and strategic planning.\" Goldstein also believes the SmartChicago platform can reduce city government\\'s costs, citing 311 services as an example. \"If we improve the way we deliver and execute services, we\\'re then being more efficient, our costs go down, we should have decreased costs,\" he said. \"If you go back to what I talked about being preventive rather than reactive, that\\'s how we reduce (311) call counts.\" SEE ALSO: 25 Technologies Every Smart City Should Have  While Goldstein certainly wants that top prize to fund his city\\'s platform, he also prioritizes sharing the innovation with other cities. \" ... I\\'m an open source guy,\" he said. \"We\\'re building this platform in an open-source way. The intent for it is to be on Github. All around, the intent is to make this extensible. [Other cities] won\\'t have to go off and buy tons of proprietary software, which is historically what you see in government, — where if you want to implement a system like this, you\\'re going to have a huge [request for proposal], you\\'re going to be replacing legacy systems and then this is a multi-year project.  \"What we\\'re architecting here is, and we\\'ve done this on a smaller scale already, is plop it in to the legacy environment, hook into your existing source systems and then have that logic at the center. So any other city can come hook it into their system and then realize the same system. Open-source, Github, making it extensible and having clear documentation along the way are really core ideas with us.\" Goldstein said he\\'s confident an alpha-beta will be ready in 12-18 months. Winners of the Mayors Challenge, to be selected \"based on their idea’s vision and novelty, potential for impact, potential for replication in other cities, and on the quality of implementation plans,\" will be announced in the spring.

       " ' The bird has landed. Twitter\\'s stock opened at just above $50 a share on Thursday, a drop of more than 23% and its lowest trading price in nearly two months. That drop effectively shaved off more than $8 billion from Twitter\\'s market cap overnight. The sharp decline followed Twitter\\'s fourth quarter earnings report on Wednesday afternoon, its first as a public company. Twitter came in well ahead of Wall Street estimates for revenue, but user growth was much slower than expected and engagement actually declined quarter-over-quarter. See also: What\\'s the Matter With Twitter? Not What Twitter Thinks Twitter reported having 241 million monthly active users at the end of the December quarter, a gain of just 9 million. In the United States, Twitter had 54 million monthly active users, a gain of just 1 million. Engagement, as measured by timeline views, declined from 159 billion in the third quarter to 148 billion in the fourth quarter.  Twitter\\'s stock had skyrocketed since the company went public in November, at one point nearly tripling from its IPO price of $26 a share. Following the earnings report, however, multiple analysts downgraded the stock. \"Expectations were higher for Twitter,\" says Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee, who lowered his rating for the stock from neutral to underperform. \"User growth and engagement are going to be the key metrics [going forward] because we all know that impacts how people think about the longterm on this company.\" The concern, according to Bhatia and others, is that the growth and engagement numbers suggest Twitter may not be able to achieve mainstream adoption and the advertising revenue that comes with it.  \"A lack of mainstream adoption or a more simplified use case was a worry of ours coming out of the IPO and seems to have come to the fore faster than we had anticipated,\" Eric Sherdian, an analyst with UBS, wrote in an investor note, downgrading Twitter stock to sell from neutral. Dick Costolo, Twitter\\'s CEO, attempted to defuse these concerns by emphasizing continued efforts to make the social network simpler for new users and explaining that some decline in engagement could be attributed to product changes like threaded conversations. Judging by the stock price, Wall Street doesn\\'t seem to be buying that explanation. \"Unless they give us historical numbers and perspective,\" Bhatia says, \"it\\'s hard to just look at that and say, \\'It\\'s ok, I don\\'t need to worry about it.\\'\"  He added: \"Most people came out scratching their heads saying, \\'If at this early stage they\\'re not getting the eyeballs, what are advertisers going to say when they see there\\'s no growth?\" Not everyone was concerned about whether Twitter was destined to be a more niche service than competitors like Facebook; some analysts have assumed as much all along. \"[M]ost of the investment community will focus on user and usage-related metrics,\" Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst with Pivotal Research, wrote in an investor note.\"We have always held that Twitter as it stands is a niche medium, but that doesn\\'t mean that it doesn\\'t retain significant value for advertisers at its current scale.\"  As of publication, the stock had ticked up slightly to $53, but was still down about 20% from the previous closing price. Even at this level, Twitter\\'s stock is still double its IPO price. ',\n",

       " ' Stars of ITV soap opera Coronation Street — one of the most-watched television programs in Britain — were caught promoting fake goods on Twitter. The sting was part of an investigation into advertising practices carried out by Dispatches, a current affairs series on rival network Channel 4, the Irish Independent reported. Over the last couple of years, the Advertising Standards Authority has clamped down on stars promoting goods on Twitter. The body demands celebrities make it clear they\\'ve received payment or freebies in exchange for their tweets. Dispatches targeted a number of younger Coronation Street stars and cajoled them into promoting a fake skincare brand and bracelet, which they received at a \"gifting event\" in Manchester, England. Actresses including Georgia May Foote, Shobna Gulati and Catherine Tyldlesey received complimentary bottles of a \"toner,\" rich in vitamins and minerals; in reality, the bottles contained nothing more than tap water. The name of the fake skincare company was Puttana Aziendale. That\\'s Italian for \"Corporate Whore.\" The Corrie stars were also tricked into tweeting about a \"positive energy\" bracelet that was actually just cheap costume jewelry. Dispatches carried out the investigation in February. A Twitter account that increased the credibility of the toner and bracelet sent a number of tweets to Coronation Street stars, urging them to enjoy the items. It retweeted some of those who tweeted about the items.  @aziendale well I\\'ve slept in my bracelet and I\\'ve sprayed my face several times.

       " \" Facial recognition, fingerprints and iris scans could soon take a back seat to the newest biometric identification method on the block: body odor. Researchers at Spain's Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, in collaboration with tech firm IIia Sistemas SL, are developing a system that can verify people by their scent signatures. SEE ALSO: 8 Facts That Will Piss You Off During The Super Bowl  Recognizable body odor patterns remain constant enough over time to allow people to be identified with an accuracy rate of 85 percent. Researchers believe this result is enough to create less aggressive ways to ID people than intrusive measures currently being used today.  While iris and fingerprint scan may have a higher accuracy rate, the researchers contend these techniques are commonly associated with criminal records, perhaps making people reluctant to participate with the process. On the other hand, facial recognition has a high error rate. Therefore, the development of scent sensors that could identify a person as they walk through a system stall could provide less invasive solutions with a relatively high accuracy rate.

The company\\'s eye care division, Alcon, will license Google\\'s smart lens and co-develop them for a variety of ocular medical uses.  Ophthalmic electrochemical sensors in the contact lenses are designed to measure glucose levels and offer real-time updates to an app on a connected mobile device for people with diabetes. Google secured a patent for the technology earlier this year. In addition to glucose measurement, the lenses may also offer vision correction for people with presbyopia, an age-related eye condition that affects billions, making it difficult to focus on objects nearby. Details on how that might work are currently unavailable.  “Our dream is to use the latest technology in the miniaturization of electronics to help improve the quality of life for millions of people,” Google founder Sergey Brin wrote in a Novartis press release. “We are very excited to work with Novartis to make this dream come true.\"   These images show how the lens would sit on the human eye (10) and how the eyelids (30 and 32) would close over it.

LifeProof nüüd Waterproof iPhone 5 Case Waterproof jack This special jack ships with the case and screws into the audio jack to form a watertight seal.          LifeProof nüüd Waterproof iPhone 5 Case Jack in iPhone 5 The iPhone 5 in the case with the jack screwed in.        More so than the people we know, our phones are our real constant companions. We take them everywhere. Think I’m kidding? In a recent survey, 75% of Americans admit to taking their phones into the bathroom. A lot of those phones get dropped on the floor, or worse, into the toilet. These phones need protection — from us. LifeProof (now owned by former rival Otterbox), has been making waterproof phone cases for a while, but its latest device, the Nüüd for iPhone 5 case, performs a new trick. It’s waterproof without a screen cover. In other words, nothing comes between your finger and the iPhone 5's retina display screen. SEE ALSO: 10 Tidy iPhone Cases to Replace Your Wallet  LifeProof pulls this off by using one of the iPhone 5’s built-in features, the Gorilla Glass, as a sealing agent. There are two seals — silicon affixed to the plastic frame and a rubber gasket right behind it — pressed hard against the glass screen to create a watertight seal, without blocking any portion of the display or impeding functionality. Naturally, I had to give this a try. Hands On Personally, I’m not a fan of iPhone cases. The iPhone 5 is a beautiful, svelte phone. I do not drop my phone, so I never felt the need to cover up its good looks with something that expresses my personal style or a bulky number that offers protection from every possible dangerous contingency. Exceptions to this rule include the Olloclip case that allows me to use both the company’s iPhone add-on lenses and a tripod mount. Another reason I hate these cases is the bulk. The LifeProof Nüüd, however, impressed me. Despite the fact that it's waterproof and drop-resistant up to 6.6 feet, the case weighs just 1.3 ounces. It adds some bulk to the thin iPhone 5 frame, but not too much — 14 millimeters in height, 11 millimeters in width and about an additional 6 millimeters in thickness. That certainly changes the way the phone feels in my pocket, but I consider it on the border of livable. Putting on the case on is easy. It’s comprised of two parts: the front, which has a large, open window for the display, and the enclosed back. The audio jack seal screws into the base. I found it easier to put the case on if you remove it from the Nüüd case first. The two halves snap together tightly; prying them apart takes a few fingernails and a bit of strength. On the outside, you still have access to all of your iPhone 5 buttons. Despite the fact I was pressing on rubber, I didn't feel as though I had to push extra-hard to activate buttons, like the Power volume controls (which isn't true for some cases I've tried). The Ring/Silent toggle is the one exception. Though I could press it one way or another and even feel the vibration through the rubber case, I wasn’t always sure if I was pushing too hard or not hard enough -– a small price to pay, though, if the phone was truly sealed. The case includes a latch to which I could access the lighting charging port. To the left is a small port for the microphone, and opposite sits a larger channel for the speaker. Despite the waterproof covering, the audio came through loud and clear. The gray/black and semi-clear plastic case (also available in white) is nothing to ogle over, but perhaps that’s the point. It aims to protect but otherwise gets out of the way. If you're looking to make a fashion statement with your cellphone case, this is not the protection for you. Into the Water and Onto the Ground  LifeProof provides a dummy iPhone 5 with every new case to test in water before exposing your own iPhone to the world of water (the Nüüd is rated for submersion up to 6.6 feet). I skipped that, stuffed my iPhone 5 inside the case, filled a sink with water and dropped it in. Then, I ran the phone under water multiple times. In every instance, the phone came out dry as a bone. The unprotected screen was wet, but there had been nothing covering it. Plus, it can’t be hurt by Mother Nature’s liquid element, anyway. During these tests, I did learn one interesting fact: Capacitive touch screens do not respond to touch under water. If you want to take underwater photos, use the covered volume up button. In my tests, the images looked fine, which is mostly thanks to the Nüüd cover’s anti-reflective glass lenses on top of each of the iPhone 5’s two camera lenses. I also took every chance I had to drop the LifeProof Nüüd-bearing iPhone 5 onto counters and floors (both carpeted and tiled) from up to 6 feet. Since the case is not entirely rubberized, the drops always sounded pretty bad, but my iPhone 5 was unharmed. Obviously, the lack of a screen cover means the screen is completely unprotected. If I want to protect it from scratches, though, I can install the optional scratch protector (included). Protection like this does not come cheap. LifeProof's Nüüd for iPhone runs at $89.99 (An equally-priced Nüüd for the Samsung Galaxy S3 arrives later this month.) That's about $30 more than Griffin Survivor Catalyst Waterproof Case for iPhone 5. Unlike the Nüüd, the Griffin case more or less seals the entire phone in clear plastic. Otherwise, it's roughly the exact same size as the Nüüd. So why spend nearly $90 for the LifeProof Nüüd? First of all, it's utterly unique in the marketplace. No other waterproof case boasts a no-compromises access to the screen. Secondly, unlike the Griffin, it looks like it's made for your pocket (and your everyday life), rather than for the beach. The design and craftsmanship are top notch and the case holds up on all its promises. Yes, I wish it was cheaper, but then again, who can put a price on the cost of protection and piece of mind?

       " '  Researchers at UCLA have developed a two-layer, see-through solar film that can be placed on any number of glass surfaces to harvest energy from the sun. The thin device uses two polymer solar cells to collect sunlight and then convert it into useable power, and can be used on windows in your home, the sunroof of your car, and even the display of your smartphone. The technology could one day be included in those products. See also: Get Lost in These 19 Fascinating Maps Researchers say that  they saw close to twice the energy using two solar cells than they did with solar cells with just one cell in a panel. A single cell device is only capable of capturing 40 percent of the infrared light that passes through it. The new two-layer device is able to absorb up to 80 percent of the infrared light that passes through it as well as some of the available visible light thanks in part to an infrared-sensitive polymer on the film. UCLA has a working prototype of the solar film ready. No word on when we might see the technology deployed. Several other schools, including MIT, are also working on their own clear solar panels.

       " \" Vacationers' plans to relax on a beach in Hawaii will hit a snag this week as two powerful storms head toward the islands. Hurricane Iselle, currently a Category One hurricane with the potential to bring strong winds to the Big Island as it makes landfall on Friday, and Hurricane Julio, which could also cause rain, winds and big waves in the region, will bring very un-holiday-like conditions for the next four or five days. See also: The Unprecedented Hurricane Scenario Playing Out in Hawaii This Week Locals are stocking up on water and other goods ahead of the storms, which are expected to be downgraded to tropical storms once they hit Hawaii. As Iselle gets closer, travelers already in the state should consider hunkering down instead of trying to get a flight before the storm hits. For those who were planning to depart for Hawaii as the storms approach, airlines are beginning to announce they will waive fees for any tickets rescheduled before departure for flights through Aug. 12.  Hawaiian Airlines is waiving ticket change fees for customers booked to travel on Aug. 7 - 8. Customers must contact the airline to change their reservation before their original flight departs. All change fees and applicable difference in fares will be waived provided that changes are made in the same class of service (i.e., Coach to Coach or First to First), based on seat availability and subject to the restrictions noted above. Changes must be made by Hawaiian Airlines personnel in Reservations or at the airport. Hawaiian Airlines’ reservations department can be reached at 1-800-367-5320. Alaska Airlines also issued a travel advisory for tickets booked on Aug. 7 - 8, and will allow changes with no fee. Travelers hoping to stay on their scheduled flight can sign up for alerts from the airline. Alaska reservations can be changed online or the airline can be reached at 1-800-252-7522. American Airlines announced a flexible policy Wednesday, allowing one change for ticketed passengers. United Airlines is waiving fees and the fare difference for flights rescheduled for before Aug. 12. Travelers can change tickets to after Aug. 12 if they are willing to pay the fare difference. Delta issued a notice that any travelers whose flights are canceled are entitled to a full refund. In addition, they are allowing one change without a fee.

       " ' Even before Google announced Android TV on Wednesday, it seemed everyone was rooting against it. Here was Google trying yet again to offer a a platform for conquering the living room — the same battle its previous champion, Google TV, definitely lost. Chromecast has actually done a decent job of cleaning up the mess left by Google TV. Chromecast is simple, cheap and popular, and can stream compatible Android apps to a tiny dongle that slips into a TV\\'s HDMI port.  So why does Google need Android TV? See also: 10 Best Indie Games on Android Not everyone has an Android phone or wants to use it as a controller for their TV. People have been trained over decades to browse TV content on a TV, and the Chromecast interface isn\\'t best suited for that. But there\\'s another reason Android TV has suddenly popped into existence. Games don\\'t really work with the Chromecast experience. While Chromecast uses the TV as a controller for video apps, that doesn\\'t work so well for games. You really need some kind of tactile controller — you know, with buttons — rather than your phone\\'s touchscreen. Android TV solves that problem. Even if the TVs and set-top boxes that will ship with Android TV don\\'t include a controller, they can always use a TV remote control, which typically has directional and \"enter\" keys that can be used as movement and jump, kick or fire buttons. You could use a game controller as well — there being no shortage of controllers that support Android. I tried out Android TV at Google I/O with one wireless controller, and the gameplay worked extremely well. I couldn\\'t detect any lag while playing Ninja Hero Cats and Implosion, and the graphics looked fine, even if they were a few noticeable notches down from a console.  The game Implosion running on an Android TV.Google seems to recognize Android TV\\'s strength as a gaming device, including a dedicated menu for games separate from other apps. And since it\\'s Android, developers should have very little work to do if they want to port their games to Android TV, especially if they already support game controllers (many do). There are tens of thousands of games on Google Play, and they account for 90% of the revenue from Android apps. This is how Android TV can actually stand out from the Rokus, the Apple TVs and numerous Smart TV platforms from TV manufacturers. There are so many different ways to get media apps on a TV already, there\\'s no way Android TV is getting anywhere with Netflix, YouTube and Songza (sorry, Songza). For a TV platform, media services like Hulu aren\\'t even table stakes anymore — providing them just means you have a table. Emphasizing games, however, is good table dressing. While it\\'s probably not going to win over many hardcore gamers (that crowd already has a PlayStation or Xbox), casual gaming on mobile is huge. If Android TV captures even a fraction of that audience, it\\'ll have served its purpose — or rather, created one. Launching a smart TV platform these days is a tricky business. Between dongles, set-top boxes and TVs themselves, we already have more than enough choices for running apps on a big screen. With games, Android TV might score a few extra points with consumers, and that could be a win for developers — and for Google.  ',\n",

Ushering in a new era of freedom for a new decade, this footage from 1989 offers powerful imagery of East and West reuniting after nearly 40 years of enforced separation.          2. The Moon Landing  We never get tired of watching this amazing clip. The 1969 Apollo 11 mission to the moon was a remarkable achievement for all of mankind, and its morale-boosting effects on the United States at the time of the Cold War can\\'t be underestimated.           3. Tiananmen Square Protests The anonymous \"Tank Man\" of this heart-stopping footage has never been identified, but the sight of him, unarmed, planted firmly in front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square in 1989 has become an enduring symbol of amazing courage.          4. Martin Luther King\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" Speech It may have been a while since you last heard Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s famous speech in full, rather than just the highlights. Despite social change since 1963, there are still wider lessons to be drawn from the civil rights hero\\'s historic words.          5. Professor Stephen Hawking\\'s Zero-Gravity Flight Not letting his ALS condition get in the way of a glittering academic career, Stephen Hawking is one of the most inspiring humans alive today. Here, at age 65, he experiences zero-gravity to help increase public interest in space exploration.           6. Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics  You could argue that America\\'s first blow against Nazi Germany in the Second World War came in 1936, as African-American Jesse Owens, the grandson of a slave, competed in the Berlin Olympics.  In the midst of Nazi propaganda about \"Aryan superiority,\" Owens discredited Hitler\\'s hideous racial assertions and came away with four gold medals.          7. Wright Brothers  We take flying for granted now, but this clip gives us a glimpse of how remarkable sustained mechanical flight was, as the Wright Brothers strove to achieve what many considered absolutely impossible.          8. President-Elect Barack Obama\\'s Victory Speech Although President Barack Obama\\'s inauguration speech is the one that will be quoted and referenced in years to come, we think his victory speech from Grant Park in his home town of Chicago best captures the electric excitement, and historic magnitude of his election into office.           9. Roger Bannister Breaks the Four-Minute Mile Although by today\\'s standards, Bannister\\'s physical achievement is not that impressive, what doesn\\'t diminish over time is how inspiring his dedication and ultimate success is. Bannister broke the four-minute mile through sheer determination. When asked how he reached his goal, he explained, “It’s the ability to take more out of yourself than you\\'ve got.”          10. Gandhi\\'s Dandi Salt March This incredible footage from 1930 shows a 61-year-old Gandhi on the famous Dandi March, in which he and his followers challenged British authority by protesting a salt tax with a peaceful 240-mile procession. The march was a seminal moment in the \"Civil Disobedience Movement,\" a very influential non-violent initiative that would eventually lead to Indian independence from British rule.        ',\n",

Brooks was acquitted of that charge and of counts of bribing officials and obstructing police. Cameron is now expected to make \"a profound apology\" for employing Coulson, following through on a promise. Three years ago he said, \"If I have been lied to, that would be the moment for profound apology. In that event, I can tell you I will not fall short.\"    PM spokesman say Cameron stands entirely by words in parliament promising to apologise if Coulson is found guilty.— Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour) June 24, 2014    The nearly eight-month trial was triggered by revelations that for years the News of the World used illegal eavesdropping to get stories, listening in on the voicemails of celebrities, politicians and even crime victims. It had become a bit of a media circus in the UK, and news organizations camped outside the courtroom after the verdict hoping for a glance at Brooks or Coulson — an ironic twist for the former tabloid editors.  Three others — Brooks\\' husband Charles Brooks, her former secretary Cheryl Carter and News International security chief Mark Hanna — were acquitted of perverting the course of justice by attempting to hide evidence from police.

Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open.          21. Head-First Slide Fail Well, that\\'s one way of doing it...right?          22.

A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however.

It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat.

       " ' Apple\\'s online store was offline this morning with a \"We\\'ll be back\" message posted in its place. It wasn\\'t \"broken,\" Apple had simply pulled the curtain closed so it could push forward a new $1,099 21.5-inch iMac. Its lowest-priced model to date. Traditionally, the Apple Store closes in the minutes or hours before a major product announcement, but there are times when a smaller hardware update or rollout gets the same treatment. There was some conjecture that this could be the prelude to an update of Apple\\'s popular MacBook Air laptop, possibly even a retina display (something Apple fans have been begging for for ages). However, the MacBook Air line remains unchanged.  See also: 16 Best Free Mac Apps This new offering, however, could appeal to those looking to get in on the ground floor of the Apple OSX experience, without sacrificing things like a screen (as they would for the cheaper, computer-in-a-little-box Mac Mini). The new iMac desktop all-in-on computer runs a considerably a slower 1.4 Ghz CPU than the next, more expensive iMac, which boasts a 2.7 GHz processor and costs $1,299. Apple also ratcheted down the hard drive to a half terabyte and switched out the Intel Iris Pro GPU for a more entry-level Intel HD Graphics 5000 GPU. The timing of the tiny launch is notable, because today is also the day that Amazon will breach a new hardware category — mobile phones — one where Apple is one of two clear leaders (the other being Samsung). Coincidence or an effort to steal a little bit of Amazon\\'s thunder? You be the judge. In the meantime, these new iMacs go on sale now and, according to Apple\\'s site, ship within 24 hours. ',\n",

       " ' For nearly two hours on Thursday, Twitter\\'s list of worldwide trending topics was dominated by hashtags like #GermanyvsUSA and #PORGHA for the two World Cup matches taking place. When Cristiano Ronaldo scored a goal for Portugal, the phrase \"finally Ronaldo\" started trending. When it was determined that the U.S. would advance to the next round to play Belgium, \"USA vs Belgium\" entered the list. If you glanced at Facebook\\'s trending section around the same time, however, you might not have realized either match was under way. When I checked Facebook halfway through the USA match, the top trending topic in my feed was about one of the players on Ghana\\'s soccer team getting suspended, followed by a headline about North Korea\\'s leader declaring actor Seth Rogen\\'s latest movie an \"act of war.\" The first news item had broken several hours before the game; the second had gained attention a day earlier.  See also: Facebook, Twitter Vie for Real-Time World Cup Conversation Then again, you might have seen a completely different list of trending topics. Unlike Twitter, Facebook customizes its trending topics for each user based on factors like your location, age, gender and Pages you like as well as what\\'s trending across the social network overall. Regardless of whether you Like soccer-related pages on Facebook, you should still see World Cup trending topics simply because there\\'s an incredibly high volume of posts about it.  So why is it that there often appears to be a lag between news events trending on Twitter and on Facebook? To some extent, it\\'s by design.  Meanwhile, on Facebook pic.twitter.com/ods5ruvVOu — Seth Fiegerman (@sfiegerman) June 26, 2014  Trending topics don\\'t just surface organically on Facebook as they do on Twitter. Facebook relies on a combination of algorithms and human editors to identify trending news, pick an appropriate headline and description and link the trending topic to a particular article. One source familiar with Facebook\\'s thinking also told us that the social network doesn\\'t believe it\\'s a great user experience to have trending topics that change every few seconds in the way you might see on Twitter.  In practice, that means when a newsworthy incident from a live event occurs — for example, Luis Suarez biting an Italian soccer player — it will surface quickly in Twitter trends just based on user activity, but it won\\'t trend on Facebook until at least some news articles have been written about it. On the other hand, that Suarez trending topic may live on Facebook significantly longer than it will on Twitter to ensure it gets viewed by the relevant audience. Yet, it\\'s also likely Facebook will miss many other smaller moments from a live event both because of this approach and by virtue of its users\\' behavior. It\\'s not unusual to see active Twitter users share dozens of updates in a day, and at least that many during a big live event like the World Cup. Every score change, every questionable referee call, every collision between players and every closeup of a bad haircut in the course of a game can be fodder for a trending moment on Twitter. But on Facebook, it\\'s far more likely you\\'ll just see a trending topic about who won. To put that another way: On Twitter, the real-time\\xa0conversation around a big event like the World Cup can be difficult\\xa0to escape. On Facebook, it can be difficult to find.  That might not come as too much of a shock to some readers. After all, \"real-time\" discussions have been an integral part of Twitter\\'s DNA from the start. Throughout the past year though, Facebook has borrowed pages from Twitter\\'s real time playbook: It introduced hashtags last June and rolled out trending topics at the beginning of this year. Facebook also felt compelled to introduce a dedicated World Cup hub to better showcase more of that real-time conversation, though you have to know to look for it. The assumption is that Facebook introduced these features in order to better compete with Twitter in the real-time marketing space. If that\\'s the case, the World Cup shows Facebook still has some work cut out for it.  Engagement on 11 Million Fans Vs 50,000 Followers, same post, same time. - Facebook Organic Reach is 100% Dead. pic.twitter.com/PE1RUns1A5 — RHYS HILLMAN (@rhyshillman) June 25, 2014  Perhaps the biggest real-time moment from the World Cup so far was the Suarez biting incident. Within minutes, many big and small brands were trying to turn the bizarre event into a clever marketing opportunity on Twitter, where it was all anyone was talking about.  Some brands, like Snickers, did also try sharing their Suarez-related posts on Facebook, but as you can see in the tweet above, it received far less engagement there despite having a significantly larger audience. \"Twitter is a more efficient place to do it because it\\'s where everybody is during the course of the game,\" Zach Pentel, director of digital strategy for BBDO New York, which represents Snickers and other brands, says of sharing real-time content. \"Facebook is for extended commentary between friends.\" Other brand reps we spoke with tended to agree.  \"Since the organic in-the-moment conversation around the World Cup really lives on Twitter, we built our World Cup promotion strategy there,\" says Sean Ryan, the social and mobile director for JC Penney. \"Twitter offers a fast-paced, real-time conversation tool, whereas Facebook offers a highly curated presentation targeted to the end user. There are benefits to both.\" The benefit for brands and users on Twitter is that tweets tied to trending topics can spike in popularity very quickly, though they often tend to fizzle out quickly and may not be relevant to many of the users who see them. The benefit for brands and users on Facebook is that posts tied to big events can have a longer shelf life, though it takes longer to bubble up and it usually needs to bigger news items. For example, a brand congratulating the U.S. soccer team for winning can do quite well on Facebook, but riffing on a referee\\'s call in the first half of the game won\\'t. \"If you carefully craft a \\'Congratulations U.S.\\' post and put it on Twitter, its half life is two hours whereas on Facebook it can last longer,\" Pentel says. \"So you see brands spending more time crafting a thoughtful response that they can put up on Facebook.\" Indeed, Facebook\\'s biggest asset over Twitter and other rival social networks is its scale, thanks to its billion-plus user base. Facebook revealed to Mashable that there were 815 million interactions — Likes, posts, comments — about the World Cup from more than 200 million users during the group stages.

The Bearcats finished their season last weekend with a 24-32 record. The video above, however, comes from the team\\'s official YouTube channel and shows that the real highlights came after each game. The pranks included a pig on a spit, jousting knights and even multiple swimming strokes — these next-level jokes must have taken some serious practice.

Check out their antics for yourself, then let us know what you think in the comments.  BONUS: 25 of YouTube\\'s Funniest Sports Fails    Sports Fails        1. Golf Cart Fail  This runaway vehicle wreaked minor on-field havoc following a high school football championship in Texas last December. But a heroic bystander hopped aboard and put on the brakes. No casualties occurred, and the clip immediately became Internet legend.           2. Penalty Kick Fail Watch out for the ricochet, goalie! This kid gets it in the right in the chops.          3. Mascot on Rollerblades Fail What happens when you put an inflatable dinosaur on rollerblades and ask it to skate down a flight of stairs? Amazingness, that\\'s what.          4. Flopping Fail In sports, to \"flop\" is to exaggerate the force of contact in hopes of drawing a favorable call from officials. But you\\'ve got to time it much, much better than this guy does.          5. Hockey Celebration Fail Apparently, if you hug a member of the opposite team after scoring a goal in hockey, you will get punched in the face.          6. Innocent Bystander Fail This kid is just in the wrong place at the wrong time...to the benefit of the rest of us.          7. Representing Your School Fail  College football mascots are supposed to represent their schools in a fun, positive light — which doesn\\'t typically include picking fights. Here, the University of Oregon\\'s duck slams the University of Houston\\'s cougar. Bonus points for the sick elbow drop, though.           8. Weightlifting Fail  Not saying we could successfully lift 432 pounds above our heads, but dang, that looks painful. German weightlifter Matthias Steiner dropped this massive barbell on his neck during the London Olympics this summer, but escaped serious injury.           9. Trampoline Dunk Fail Sometimes, when you fail, you actually win.          10. Hurdling Fail  Why jump over hurdles when you could just RUN STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM? File under: Never, Ever Gets Old.           11. Paying Attention Fail After what could best be described as an \"optimistic\" shot attempt in a game last season, NBA center JaVale McGee showed some nice hustle getting back on defense. Only problem? His team still had the ball.          12. Judgment Fail But that wasn\\'t McGee\\'s only legendary moment. Here, he shows why it\\'s not a good idea to try dunking from the free throw line mid-game.          13. Olympic Promo Fail  For some reason, London\\'s Olympic promotions this summer involved hanging Mayor Boris Johnson on a zipline while waving a pair of tiny flags. Then he got stuck halfway through and it was pretty much the best, funniest, awkwardest thing that could have happened.           14. Grand Slam Celebration Fail Major Leaguer Kendry Morales broke his lower left leg while celebrating a game-winning grand slam in 2010. This edited video provides the before, during and after rundown.          15. Slam Dunk Fail See? White guys can jump? It\\'s just the landing that\\'s the hard part.          16. High Dive Fail The announcer here sums it up perfectly. She calls this attempt from the 1992 Olympics \"an absolute failed dive.\"          17. Piggyback Ride Fail What begins as an innocent enough piggyback ride atop a fuzzy mascot turns into a pretty epic collision — and YouTube gold.          18. Long Jump Fail Dude! If you\\'re gonna pump up the crowd like that, you can\\'t just faceplant into the sand.          19. Touchdown Celebration Fail When you think about it, is there any better way to celebrate a touchdown than by pegging an unsuspecting spectator in the face? Bonus points for originality, at least.          20. Pro Golfer Fail You\\'d think a professional golfer could put the ball in the hole with less than 16 strokes. Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open.          21. Head-First Slide Fail Well, that\\'s one way of doing it...right?          22. Time Management Fail  Tie game, clock winding down — it\\'s always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. This classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut\\'s Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011.           23. Boogie Boarding Fail Its veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack.          24. Sportsmanship Fail  The summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. So it makes perfect sense that he\\'d let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That\\'s what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video.           25. Standing on a Basketball Hoop Fail We\\'re not quite sure why this mascot thought standing on top of a basketball rim was a good idea.

       " ' Amazon has locked down the premiere dates for its first foray into original programming.  Alpha House, a comedy about senators in Washington, D.C., will debut on Nov. 15 on Amazon Instant Video. And Betas, a series that follows social media startup employees, will debut Nov. 22, Amazon announced Monday. Each series has 11 episodes. See also: 34% of Millennials Watch More Online Video Than TV The launch of the two shows marks the first full length series available exclusively through Amazon. The first three episodes in each series will be available to all Amazon customers for free. After that, the remaining episodes will launch in weekly installments just to Amazon Prime customers.  Alpha House stars John Goodman (pictured, above), Clark Johnson, Matt Malloy and Mark Consuelos as four senators who share a home. The political comedy also features Cynthia Nixon, Amy Sedaris and Wanda Sykes. \"We also tried to make a few political points along the way, but mostly, we wanted the show to be as much fun for the audience as we and the cast had making it,\" Alpha House writer Garry Trudeau said in a statement. Trudeau is best known as the cartoonist behind the political comic strip Doonesbury. Betas also follows four central characters — a group of  Silicon Valley friends who try to launch a new mobile social networking app.  In April, customers were asked to watch and rate a slate of 14 pilots. From the list, five were selected to become full series: Alpha House, Betas and three children\\'s shows. The kids\\' shows (Annebots, Creative Galaxy and Tumbleaf) are still in production, according to Amazon Studios.  Since that first round of comedy pilots, Amazon Studios has used the same user feedback model for drama pilots. Currently, two hour-long and three half-hour long drama pilots are being vetted for full series production.

       " \" LOS ANGELES — One day after HBO executives hinted at major True Detective Season 2 casting news coming down the pike, two actors are said to be circling roles on the upcoming installment of the anthology series.  First up, Colin Farrell is in serious talks with the network to star in Season 2, which will be set in California, as Deadline first reported. Though, no deal has been made official yet, Mashable confirmed. Meanwhile, The Wrap reports that Friday Night Lights alum Taylor Kitsch is also circling a role.  See also: 13 Devastating Emmy Snubs If the casting rumors are true, the duo would fill two of four major roles in the upcoming season.  On Thursday, during a Q&A at the Television Critics Association press tour, HBO president of programing Michael Lombardo said they were looking at a number of well-known names for the new season, which does not yet have a premiere date. True Detective's first season walked away with 12 nominations for the 2014 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series and two for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for stars Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey.  If the deal goes through, it would be Farrell's first television gig since his guest appearance on Scrubs in 2005.  Kitsch most recently paired up with HBO for Ryan Murphy's adaptation of The Normal Heart, which walked away with 16 Emmy nominations.  What do you think of this possible casting? \",\n",
       " ' Crying \"I\\'ve been hacked!\" to cover up a big mistake on Twitter is all too easy. You\\'ll have skeptics and you might have to work hard to convince them your lie is the truth, in part because some people and brands intentionally fake hacks as a desperate cry for attention. Sometimes, covering up your error might mean shelling out thousands of dollars. Back in 2011, then-Congressman Anthony Weiner tweeted a photo of his crotch in a botched direct message. The recipient, of course, was not his wife, Huma Abedin. At first, Weiner claimed he\\'d been hacked and that someone else had thrown the intimate image onto his feed. After the scandal received widespread press attention, Weiner pledged there would be an investigation into how the outrageous incident occurred. It was clearly an attempt to save face — and his congressional career. As we all know, it was Weiner himself who sent the image. But to keep up his ruse, it seems Weiner paid thousands to investigators to track down the perpetrator (i.e. himself). The married New York City mayoral candidate paid private eye company T&M Protection services $43,100 from campaign funds, according to campaign records. The New York Daily News noted it\\'s not exactly clear what the form was looking into or what it found, but you can probably read between the lines. Weiner also claimed he\\'d asked BakerHostetler to look into the issue. The campaign forked over $93,350 to the law firm between Jan. 2010 and Dec. 2012. It\\'s not evident how much of that funding was earmarked for looking into the phony Twitter hack since it carried out work for him over a longer period. The cash came from his campaign funds from his congressional bids, from a committee that remained active for two years after he resigned from congress in the wake of his first sexting scandal. He only asked the Federal Election commission to shut down the campaign committee two weeks ago, The Daily News claims. Legal questions over Weiner\\'s use of funding for a goose chase remain. The paper cites an employee at the Center for Responsive Politics (a nonpartisan group that tracks the flow of money in politics) as saying laws covering campaign funds make it unclear as to whether Weiner appropriating cash for such an activity would be considered improper. Still, Weiner probably has more pressing matters on his mind right now. Like how he can\\'t stop flirting with young women online, how he is incapable of not sending sexually explicit photos of himself. He got caught after again sexting and having phone sex with a young woman in an online relationship last year. At least this time he owned up to his indiscretion quickly.

       " \" There's a new player suiting up for the NFL season — one with the potential to affect almost every play.  It's the Microsoft Surface, which made its on-field debut during the preseason game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Giants on Sunday. See also: 7 Things You Didn’t Know About Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 The Surface tablets will make it easier for teams to review plays on the fly. Currently, the NFL uses sideline cameras to capture action; those photos are then relayed to a printer, where someone takes the printouts, stuffs them in a binder, and runs them to the coaches. Even with black and white photos, the process takes about 30 seconds minimum, according to a Microsoft blog post about the partnership. Clearly, there is a lot of room for high-tech improvement. With special Surface Pro 2 tablets connected to a private Wi-Fi network at the stadium, those same photos can get to the coaches' hands just a few seconds after the play happens. The photos are also in full color; the players and coaches will be able to zoom in on details and even annotate the pictures with a digital pen. What they won't be able to do is tweet or check email. The heavily modified Surface tablets can only run essentially one app: the Sideline Viewing System (SVS). Even the cameras are disabled, Bloomberg reports. The device lockdown is partly to keep things simple, but also to ensure the devices adhere to NFL regulations, which prohibit computers of any kind on the sidelines. That's the reason the photo process has been so decidedly low-tech for so long, and Microsoft worked with the NFL to ensure the Surfaces were scrubbed of anything that could lend an unfair advantage to either team. Why the Surface Pro 2 and not the newer, sleeker Surface Pro 3? Probably because the deal was in place before the latest model made its debut in the late spring, and the Surface Pro 2 is physically modified, too; it has a thicker bezel to ensure it will stand up to the punishment of the NFL season.  The modified Surface Pro 2 tablets that the NFL is using have the cameras disabled and can run only a special photo viewing system.Image:  MicrosoftYou'd think that if the NFL was prioritizing durability, it would have chosen a Panasonic ToughPad or something similar, but remember — there are marketing dollars here at work, too. The Surface's game day arrival is rooted in a partnership between Microsoft and the NFL, which began last year. Microsoft also debuted new NFL apps for Xbox and Windows 8 just in time for the start of the preseason. BONUS: Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Review  \",\n",
       " ' A previously unseen photograph shows an American P.O.W. and a Taliban commander in what at least one right-leaning U.S. publication is calling a “bro hug.” Sgt.

Bergdahl, now back in the United States and undergoing psychiatric counseling in Texas, is seen wearing a white shirt, smiling and looking slightly emaciated in the photograph. Standing next to him, with his arm around the P.O.W., is Haqqani. He, too, is smiling, one eyebrow slightly raised. Haqqani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012, meaning the photograph is at least almost two years old. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in June 2009 after walking away from his base in eastern Afghanistan. He was freed nearly five years later in a prisoner exchange for five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay, creating a furor in the United States. Some soldiers and politicians had called him a deserter, while others have urged the country to wait for the facts to come out. In the letters obtained by The Daily Beast, Bergdahl seemed to know of the potential firestorm of controversy that awaited him if he was ever set free — and urged restraint. “If this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),” he wrote in a letter dated March 23, 2013. “Please tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in.” Mashable’s Colin Daileda contributed to this report.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' The Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments Tuesday in the case involving California\\'s Proposition 8, which passed in 2008 and banned the state from recognizing same-sex marriages. The audio of the back-and-forth between the justices and lawyers on either side of the case can be heard in its entirety here:  The Supreme Court won\\'t deliver a ruling on Proposition 8 until later this summer. Oral arguments can give some faint clues as to what the justices might do — indeed, some reporters suggested the justices\\' comments and lines of questioning might indicate they will decide the case lacks standing.  First #SCOTUS take: Very significant questions about whether the proponents had standing to bring the #Prop8 appeal at all. — Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) March 26, 2013   Just left Prop 8 case.

       " ' Mark Zuckerberg is facing the wrath of some liberals angry his political group indirectly bankrolled ads praising two senators for their support of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Liberal frustration over the ads seem amplified by a feeling of betrayal. Their response is summed up best by a ThinkProgress story headlined \"Mark Zuckerberg’s New Political Group Spending Big On Ads Supporting Keystone XL and Oil Drilling\" and a petition entitled \"FWD.us: Stop Running Ads Supporting Fossil Fuels.\" A forward-thinking futurist Silicon Valley-type ought to be a progressive, right? Well, it\\'s not quite that simple. The truth of it comes in two parts.  First, the ads themselves. They support two senators, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Mark Begich of Alaska (another ad for Marco Rubio focuses on immigration reform without mentioning energy policy). The ads were funded by two subsidiaries of FWD.us, Zuckerberg\\'s group, each of which was set up to work with different sides of the political aisle. Liberals are upset mostly because both ads praise the lawmakers for their support of expanding drilling programs and particularly the Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline would carry oil from Canada and the northern United States to the gulf region, and is opposed by many on the left. Some are also dismayed over FWD.us\\' strategy of supporting one Democrat and one Republican, but more on the political maneuvering of it later.   While the ads mention the expansion of oil drilling among other praises for Graham and Begich, they\\'re not solely focused on drilling or Keystone XL, as the above ThinkProgress headline and petition might lead one to believe.  Digging a little further, we find the political rational for FWD.us. While the group\\'s goals aren\\'t limited to comprehensive immigration reform — they also include education reform, science funding, and as spokesperson Kate Hansen put it, \"policy changes needed to build the knowledge economy,\" immigration is certainly its highest priority policy goal at the moment. That\\'s most clearly evidenced by Zuckerberg\\'s recent op-ed pushing for immigration reform. As the ThinkProgess piece and a Salon post criticizing it both correctly point out, neither Graham nor Begich\\'s constituencies support immigration reform. For FWD.us, it makes good political sense to give those senators an offer: Vote with us on our core issue, and we\\'ll contribute to ads protecting you from the wrath of conservative voters who aren\\'t on board the immigration reform train. That brings us to Zuckerberg himself. It\\'s unclear why liberals and progressives should see him as one of the flock. Zuckerberg has met with President Barack Obama to discuss the technology sector and job creation, but the relationship hasn\\'t blossomed into anything beyond that.  His first major political move — hosting a fundraiser for Republican Governor Chris Christie —  gives cause for the opposite view, though Christie is more centrist than other Republicans on the national stage, certainly including Graham.  Zuckerberg\\'s follow-up, launching a pro-immigration PAC, seems progressive on the surface, but can be explained in the context of business: Facebook and other American technology companies have an interest in being able to easily attract the world\\'s top talent to come to work in the United States.  And that\\'s where Zuckerberg\\'s politics ultimately lie: not necessarily on one side of the aisle or another, but in Facebook itself. Image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ',\n",

       " ' A new study has found that manmade global warming likely intensified an unusual weather pattern that led to both the California drought and the cold and snowy winter in the eastern U.S.  The study, accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is the first peer reviewed research to examine the reasons behind a strong and stubborn area of high pressure, or a \"ridge\" in the upper atmosphere, across the Gulf of Alaska since November, and a sharp dip in the jet stream, or \"trough,\" across the East.  In finding a tie to manmade climate change, the study is likely to spark further research and debate on this topic.  See also: California Suffers Astonishingly Fast Snowpack Melt as Drought Intensifies Until now, scientists have not had any evidence linking the occurrence of California\\'s drought to global warming, although other research has shown that climate change can worsen drought conditions once they are triggered.   Map of geopotential height anomalies, which illustrates the jet stream pattern for January 2014. The black arrows were added to show the approximate mean location/direction of jet stream winds.Image:  NOAA/ESRLThe study, from researchers at Utah State University and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, found that the ridge in the North Pacific acted like a massive \"detour\" sign in the upper atmosphere, causing storms to bypass California, and dive into the Midwest and Northeast instead. This weather pattern, characterized by the Gulf of Alaska ridge and Great Lakes trough, is described as a \"dipole\" pattern.  This dipole led to record warmth in California and Alaska, and some of the coldest weather seen since the 1970s in the Midwest and East Coast. California had its warmest winter on record, while seven states in the Midwest had one of their top 10 coldest winters. The researchers used a sophisticated computer model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo., to explore the weather pattern\\'s links to natural climate cycles like El Niño and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Both involve changes in Pacific Ocean conditions and atmospheric pressure patterns.  What they found was surprising. This dipole pattern has occurred relatively frequently since the mid-20th century, but has become more intense since the 1970s — meaning the ridges and troughs have become wavier, much like ocean waves that are getting taller.  According to the study, the dipole event during the winter of 2013-2014 was by far the most intense recorded in the time period they studied. The study\\'s finding that these patterns are intensifying — and that further intensification is likely — should worry California water managers, since such patterns are associated with drought in that state. “This year is a wakeup call that an oscillation like this is important for California”, lead author Simon Wang of Utah State University told Mashable. The study also found that the dipole seems to precede El Niño events by about one year. An El Niño event, characterized by warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, is currently forecast to develop by the fall. Wang says the computer model accurately captured the relationship between the dipole and El Niño only after the manmade increase in greenhouse gases was included in its calculations. This suggests that global warming is boosting the strength of this dipole pattern, and is consistent with other research showing that climate change is altering the jet stream. The researchers looked at how this weather pattern became established during the fall of 2013, and intensified into the winter. They found it had its origins in the Western Pacific, where a series of large, slow moving atmospheric waves known as Rossby waves originated, before moving across the North Pacific, where they spread their energy and helped to set up the dipole pattern.  Scientists not involved in the study were cautious about its conclusions — in part because it was based on one computer model, rather than comparisons between multiple models.  \"Because results of the current study depend so heavily on what happens over the tropical Pacific — a region with often considerable differences across models — it is especially important that their results be examined and reproduced with multiple models,\" said Randall M. Dole, senior scientist at NOAA\\'s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder. \"It\\'s not a bombshell, but it is worth pursuing further.\" For his part, Wang said the model used in the study is best able to simulate El Niño events, which makes it better suited to a study like this. “We know this is a very good model in terms of simulation of El Niño evolution,” he said in an interview. “We’re pretty confident in the results.” Both Gavin Schmidt, deputy director of NASA\\'s Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, and Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, told Mashable the hypothesis is interesting but needs further testing.  \"This type of analysis addresses one of the most cutting-edge issues in climate science today: how is human-induced climate change interacting with and potentially affecting natural patterns of weather and climate variability?\" Hayhoe said. She and Schmidt view the study as \"certainly suggestive\" but \"not yet conclusive.\" ',\n",

       " ' A former vendor on the now-defunct online black market bazaar known as Silk Road sent a letter laced with the poison Ricin to U.S. President Barack Obama, according to a letter submitted by an official at the Department of Homeland Security.  Brian de Vallance, the acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs for DHS, briefly mentioned the poisoning attempt in a letter he sent the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Officials from various federal agencies submitted letters to the committee, which had requested information in August for a hearing on digital currencies that took place Monday.  See also: Exclusive: Inside the World of a Silk Road Drug Dealer Prior to Monday\\'s hearing, a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee aide emailed Mashable de Vallance\\'s letter, in addition to others from the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. De Vallance sent the letter on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security. Though the Ricin comment was little more than a side note in a letter intended to outline the potential dangers of digital currencies, it disclosed a previously unknown link between the two crime stories. \"Of recent noteworthy interest was the determination that the suspect who had sent Ricin to President Obama earlier this year was a vendor on the Silk Road site,\" de Vallance wrote.  Before the FBI seized the site and arrested its alleged owner on Oct. 1, Silk Road operated for two-and-a-half years. During that time, more than 100,000 users conducted more than $1 billion worth of transactions for drugs and other contraband, according to FBI documents.  The chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen. Tom Carper (D-De.), also confirmed the Ricin poisoning attempt in conjunction with Silk Road during Monday\\'s hearing which was live streamed on C-SPAN. Neither Carper nor de Vallance provided any specific details. Though the \"suspect\" de Vallance mentioned was not named, two people have been accused of sending Ricin letters to Obama during the past year. James Everett Dutschke, of Tupelo, Miss., was arrested on April 27 for allegedly sending poisoned letters to Obama, a senator and a county judge, on April 8. Two months later, pregnant Texas actress Shannon Richardson was arrested on similar charges.  The DHS letter does not identify the Silk Road vendor who sent a Ricin letter to Obama as Dutschke, Richardson or anyone else. The letter also does not make reference to the alias of the Silk Road vendor involved.  A DHS spokesperson told Mashable the agency could not comment on the situation because it involves an ongoing investigation. Image: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' Newark Airport, like all of the New York region\\'s major transportation hubs, could use some work. In airport rankings last year, Newark came in as the fourth worst in the country. But things are looking up, at least from one angle: The dining experience at Terminal C is getting a complete overhaul. See also: Finally, airline food delivered to your doorstep United Airlines and airport eatery company OTG Management announced Monday their plan to bring more than 55 new dining venues to the terminal, creating an \"unrivaled travel experience\" that both the companies and local officials hope will make the airport a world-class dining destination. United announced its selection of OTG in September for a $120-million investment into the dining options for the carrier\\'s main terminal.  Image:  OTG\"[The] dining venues will provide travelers with an array of culinary choices, with menus at all price points emphasizing fresh, locally sourced ingredients, and highlighting regional and local dining experiences,\" the companies announced in a statement. The collaborating chefs include Alain Ducasse, Marc Forgione, Paul Liebrandt, Alex Guarnaschelli, Mario Carbone and many more. In addition to the diverse culinary options, OTG is working with United to introduce a unique payment system, and it involves iPads. A lot of iPads. At every seat in the terminal, there will be an iPad which travelers can use to order food, beverages, and even travel accessories like neck pillows.  Newark airport is getting iPads that travelers can order from at nearly every seat.Image:  OTG ManagementThe visual menu includes all of the available items in the terminal, has 20 different languages, and lets consumers purchase items with United reward miles. It is the first system that gives travelers the option to redeem miles to make in-person purchases. OTG and United have worked to make it as seamless a process as possible. Travelers are able to voluntarily scan their boarding pass, which links to their United account and shows how many miles they currently have.   OTG and United have announced a system that lets users pay using their reward miles after scanning their boarding pass.Image:  OTG ManagementPrices for items in the menu are listed both in dollars and miles, and orders are delivered directly to the traveler\\'s seat. Eventually, there will be about 6,000 iPads for travelers to use in Terminal C alone.  OTG and United announced a payment system that will allow travelers to use miles to buy food and beverages in the airport.Image:  OTG ManagementTravelers will also be able to access the internet for free using the devices. \"Airports across the country have been stepping up their game by offering more amenities and putting passengers first, so we applaud OTG and United for doing the same at Newark,” said Joe Sitt, chairman and founder of Global Gateway Alliance. “Our studies have shown that Newark is making progress when it comes to amenities, but only the kind of overhaul announced today will mean a true 21st Century airport experience for millions of passengers.\" In 2013, more than 35 million passengers went through Newark International Airport, according to the Port Authority. The first rollout will include 1,000 iPads, and more than 45 of the new venues will open over the next seven weeks. The entire transformation of the terminal is expected to take 18 months. ',\n",

       " ' Since 1952, much of America\\'s sense of humor has been created and inspired by a very different kind of Mad Men. Just ask John Ficarra, editor in chief of Mad magazine, who is celebrating his 30th year as the ringleader of the country\\'s favorite \"usual gang of idiots,\" as the satirical publication has long dubbed itself. As Mad itself has struggled with newsstand sales, the comedians it inspired have gone on to far greater fame and fortune. See also: Mark Zuckerberg Is Mad Magazine\\'s Latest Coverboy [PIC] \"You can blame us for corrupting a lot of generations,\" Ficarra told Mashable at Comic-Con last weekend. \"There\\'s such a swath of people who feel Mad influenced them — Stephen Colbert, Weird Al Yankovic, the writers of The Simpsons.\" Ficarra, his face etched with laugh lines, gives a chuckle that sounds well-used. \"If they want to save the trouble of a lawsuit, they can mail us the checks now.\" When the company put out a general request for introductions to its book Inside Mad, it received hymns of praise from people ranging from Ken Burns to Roseanne Barr to Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner. The era Weiner writes about was turned upside down, in large part, by Mad: the generation that protested Vietnam and helped bring down a president were raised on the magazine, which didn\\'t accept advertisements and thus felt free to lampoon an entire consumer culture with caustic wit. Few members of that generation were shy about citing Mad as an influence. Even George Lucas has credited Mad for helping to birth the Star Wars saga. \"I have spent much of my career telling stories about characters who fight to change the dominant paradigm,\" Lucas wrote in 2007. \"For that, Alfred E. Neuman bears at least a little of the blame.\" The trouble is that Mad is itself a baby boomer in a world of millennials. At the ripe old age of 62, it\\'s not nearly as popular, shocking or overtly influential as it once was. The magazine peaked at 2 million newsstand sales in the 1970s, and now sells fewer than 100,000 issues at newsstands, the lowest it\\'s ever seen. Its online competition, such as The Onion, is increasingly sophisticated. Neuman, the fictitious mascot and cover boy of Mad, is an icon, but his face actually hails from a 19th century portrait that is now 110 years old. It can be hard to keep that gap-toothed grin, and the content that goes along with it, fresh for decade after decade.

Whenever the magazine emphasizes topical events and people on the cover — Neuman drowning in the waters of Hurricane Katrina, Miley Cyrus twerking, Mark Zuckerberg — sales shoot up. The last issue compared the leadership of Vladimir Putin to Sharknado 2, and portrayed Kim and Kanye as the stars of Bride of Frankenstein. \"Our humor has changed,\" Ficarra insisted. \"It\\'s certainly more snarky, a little more adult. We always mirror society, and society has ramped it up.\" Has Mad correspondingly ramped up, though?

He\\'s quick to point out that although newsstand sales are down, the number of Mad subscribers — roughly 100,000 — has held steady for pretty much its entire life. For generations of kids, he\\'s seen a pattern in the subscribers: They pick it up around the age of 12, drop it at age 16, then subscribe again out of nostalgia in their 20s. The average age of a Mad reader is 24. \"I think it can continue indefinitely,\" Ficarra said. \"There’s always another idiot in the White House. There’s always corrupt politicians, always another bad movie, another lousy TV show, all this stupid stuff happening that needs to be mocked mercilessly, and that’s where we come in.\" But as much as the humor changes, and kids grow more sophisticated, the editor has a line he won\\'t cross. \"We still won’t use four-letter words and we\\'ll parse words. We’ll say that guy really has balls to say that; we won’t say kick you in the balls,\\'\" he said. \"We’ll say that guy’s a real prick; we won’t say he has a small prick.\" \"Although in your case, we might make an exception,\" he quips. \"Boom boom!\" It was such a quintessential Mad moment: simultaneously adolescent, authority-tweaking and gutsy. That guy, and that magazine, still has balls. ',\n",
       " ' General Motors CEO Mary Barra will address the House of Representatives\\' Energy & Commerce Committee on Wednesday over an ignition switch glitch that has been linked to 13 deaths and 5.8 million recalls. Committee members are expected to grill Barra about the company\\'s negligence over the issue and the role of an engineer, Ray DeGiorgio, who played an instrumental role in the issue. (You can watch the hearing live below.) See also: How One GM Engineer\\'s Decisions Helped Lead to 5.8 Million Recalls  Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream Earlier this year, Barra testified that she was unable to answer certain questions until the company’s internal investigation was complete. On Wednesday, the committee will get those answers and compare them to their own findings, according to full committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy (R-PA). Among the witnesses on Wednesday will be Anton Valukas, a former federal prosecutor who authored a 325-page report detailing GM\\'s mishandling of the issue.  See also: 5 Reasons You Should Care About the GM Recall \"The Valukas report, as you now know, is extremely thorough, brutally tough and deeply troubling,\" Barra wrote in a written testimony.  \"It paints a picture of an organization that failed to handle a complex safety issue in a responsible way. I was deeply saddened and disturbed as I read the report. For those of us who have dedicated our lives to this company, it is enormously painful to have our shortcomings laid out so vividly. There is no way to minimize the seriousness of what Mr. Valukas and his investigators uncovered.\"  Barra went on to say that she\\'s addressed many of the issues in the report.

GM spokesman Greg Martin declined to comment to Reuters about the $10 billion lawsuit. \"GM\\'s egregious and widely publicized conduct and the never-ending and piecemeal nature of GM\\'s recalls has so tarnished the affected vehicles that no reasonable consumer would have paid the price they did when the GM brand meant safety and success,\" the complaint says. Barra says dealerships are extending hours When asked how GM can service all the 17.7 million or so cars that have been recalled so far this year, Barra said some dealers are extending their hours. Such dealers can service dozens of vehicles a day. Some fixes take hours, Barra said. She added that GM will start production of a replacement switch on another line soon to fill pipeline for repairs.     Your safety is paramount.

He then asked why GM took 10 months to address it. “Why the foot drag? Is this typical of GM’s investigations into a product concern?\" Gingery also said that the 10-month gap  \"smacks of a big coverup to me.\" Valukas, when asked to define a cover-up, said it would be a case where someone knew they had a major safety issue and took steps to hide it.

       " ' BROOKLYN, N.Y. — By the time Yoko Ono and the psychedelic Flaming Lips took the stage at 12:30 a.m. Thursday, about half of the audience at Amnesty International\\'s Bringing Human Rights Home concert had left Barclays Center to head home.  It was the culmination of a long mid-week concert at which both the musicians and audience were enthusiastic about pairing songs and activism, but neither group seemed totally confident carrying that torch. The event featured nine musical acts built around a speaking appearance by two recently-freed Russian activists from punk band Pussy Riot. See also: 12 Top YouTube Videos for Social Good The five-hour event that started Wednesday was a roller-coaster ride that was often thrilling but sometimes fell emotionally flat. Most notably, the crowd cheered raucously for the night\\'s honored guests — Pussy Riot\\'s Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova — but awkwardly failed to pick up on a \"Russia will be free\" chant the two women tried to incite. Madonna, who introduced Pussy Riot, trumpeted her history as a \"freedom fighter\" and, for some reason, felt the need to tell everyone when to \"boo\" and when to cheer during her speech.  The show was packed with short performances from a range of big-name pop acts, including Lauryn Hill, Blondie, Imagine Dragons, The Fray, Cold War Kids, Tegan and Sara, Colbie Caillat and Bob Geldof. Several of the artists re-emerged on stage with the Flaming Lips for the show\\'s finale rendition of Bob Dylan\\'s \"I Shall Be Released,\" which also included appearances from Ono and Sean Lennon, son of The Beatles\\' John Lennon.  Perhaps an indication of how the musicians didn\\'t seem completely connected to the event, several of the singers read the lyrics of Dylan\\'s iconic tune from a piece of paper.  During their own sets, newer musicians like Imagine Dragons and The Fray sounded good and got the crowd moving, but their songs didn\\'t seem to have the same connection to human rights as the U2, Bruce Springsteen and The Police performances from the now-famous Amnesty shows of the 1980s, which were recapped with commentary from the artists on video monitors between bands.    Bono of U2, left, and Sting of The Police answer questions at a news conference at Giants Stadium regarding the final concert of the \"Conspiracy of Hope\" tour in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 14, 1986. Image: Bill Kostroun/Associated PressTo Amnesty\\'s credit, several veteran musicians were pitch perfect carrying on the organization\\'s musical tradition. Irish singer Bob Geldof, of The Boomtown Rats, knew how to navigate an activist crowd. While other acts were introduced by the likes of Susan Sarandon and Amnesty\\'s senior staff, Geldof gave his own intro. The 62-year-old rattled off a strongly-worded, profanity-laced speech, challenging the audience to not only get involved with Amnesty\\'s efforts but also to encourage friends to do the same.  Geldof, who also performed at the last of Amnesty\\'s classic six-show \"Conspiracy of Hope\" tour at Giants Stadium in 1986, followed his speech by singing three protest songs in an airy brogue.  Blondie tore through a three-song set that included past hits \"One Way or Another\" and \"Call Me,\" as well as a newer song called \"A Rose by Any Name.\" Other artists had to coax the audience to their feet — not Blondie. The crowd immediately rose to greet Debbie Harry and stayed standing as the 68-year-old singer shook her hips and strutted back-and-forth across the stage in knee-high leather boots.  The brevity of the performances is one possible reason some of the acts failed to build momentum. After Cold War Kids opened the concert with \"Miracle Mile,\" an upbeat and thumping rock song, singer Nathan Willett made sure to note that the band would only \"have time for two songs.\" Most of the other bands played three-song sets. Only Lauryn Hill, or \"Ms. Lauryn Hill\" as she\\'s now known, played longer.  Hill received her loudest applause when she was introduced. Unlike the other acts, she did not play any of her most popular songs. But Hill still showed off her substantial vocal talent — at times rattling off verbose rap verses and at other times dropping into a low-pitched soul singer\\'s range — during a five-song set that ended with a cover of Bob Marley\\'s \"Zimbabwe.\" It\\'s true, not every humanitarian musical event can be like Live Aid or George Harrison\\'s Concert For Bangladesh. And it\\'s more than understandable for a crowd to lose its fizz toward the end of a five-hour Wednesday night concert that didn\\'t start until after 8 p.m.  In the videos between sets, some the past pop music icons and champions of human rights — Bono, Sting and Springsteen — talked about passing the torch to a younger generation of musicians. The Brooklyn show did, however, leave some doubt that today\\'s popular musicians are ready for that considerable responsibility. The concert was recorded and is expected to be broadcast sometime next month, though Amnesty International has not yet announced further details. Check out the gallery below for some memorable moments from the concert.

       " '  Poor, poor Hunahpu.  The unwise tribe has used up all but a handful of its rice rations and is now in a dire situation that can only be remedied by the man who loves having ultimate Survivor power, Jeff Probst. In our short interview below, Probst reveals that he had been hoping the Hunahpu food drama would reach a level that required his interference.  See also: CBS Launches Digital Subscription Service So what exactly happens in Wednesday\\'s episode when Probst walks over to the tribe, literally carrying the answer to the group\\'s problems? Well, the host says, his demand involves less nudity than when Jenna and Heidi disrobed on Survivor: Amazon in exchange for peanut butter and chocolate cookies. But that was a conscious choice. Read more from our email chat below and check out an exclusive clip from the new episode above. Mashable: First question: Does this exchange include more or less nudity than the peanut butter/chocolate moment from Amazon? Jeff Probst: Such a good question because you hit at the heart of where my initial instinct went as I was walking up to their beach carrying a bag of rice. I was thinking okay, what would make for the most interesting and memorable moment? Nudity of course! So I quickly began to assess the options. There are plenty of hot bodies to choose from but which sex do you ask to nude up? If I ask the women I would be appropriately labeled a pig. If I ask the guys to drop trou, well that\\'s just a wasted opportunity because guys look stupid naked and nobody wants to see it. So I opted for plan B. Not as titillating but pretty damn satisfying and definitely a game changer.  Jeff Probst carries a bag of rice — the answer to one tribe\\'s biggest problem — in the next episode of \\'Survivor.\\'Image:  Monty Brinton/CBSWhat was your reaction when you first learned of the rice situation? Did any part of you want to just let them deal with the repercussions/see how creative they could get? When I first heard they were getting low on rice, I pulled out my treasured carved, wooden Survivor totem. It\\'s pretty beat up, but it still works. It\\'s saved more episodes than Russell Hantz or Boston Rob combined. I gently rubbed its head and said the same thing I always say in times of need, \"Dear Survivor Gods, please make it happen. Please make it happen.\" Then I went back into my teepee and waited for the updates. Two days later the answer came — they ate the last of their rice. \"It\" happened. The gods had come through once again. Advantage, Probst! Game on! What does this rice drama do to the Hunahpu as a tribe? Is there fracturing or do they recognize that this is really a collective mistake? It definitely causes some chaos. Some of the tribe are very unhappy that they are in this position. Especially those who ended up there as a result of the switch and had very little to do with the over eating. But there is another way of looking at this situation. Think of it this way — with the exception of the challenge they threw, Hunahpu has not lost an immunity challenge. And the big reason seems to be the staggering amount of rice they were eating gave them a physical advantage. So, you could make the case, that if you don\\'t mind the invoice that comes for more rice, then maybe it\\'s not the worst strategy. This is after all a game in which your goal is to outlast everybody else.   Survivor airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS. ',\n",

       " ' The Wrong Mans, Hulu\\'s latest original series, switches from espionage drama to workplace comedy to art heist to buddy cop adventure and back again — all within six episodes. The show, a co-production with the BBC, is also very British. That\\'s either a pro or a con, depending on your affinity for dry, awkward comedy (and accents).  Most importantly, though, The Wrong Mans is good. See also: 10 Most TiVo\\'d New Fall TV Shows When Sam, a town council planning adviser, faints after witnessing a car crash on the way to work, he wakes up with a stranger\\'s cell phone and subsequently becomes embroiled in the ultimate case of mistaken identity — or, rather, cases — as he and his underachieving coworker Phil stumble their way into a hostage negotiation, a kidnapping, a government conspiracy and more horrible situations in the countryside.  The Wrong Mans stars comedy duo James Corden (Phil), one of the comedy minds behind the delightful Gavin and Stacey (a U.S. remake, titled Us and Them, is currently scheduled for midseason on Fox), and Mathew Baynton (Sam), Corden\\'s Gavin and Stacey costar and a lead in British children\\'s series Horrible Histories. \"I\\'m intrigued to see what the difference in response from an American crowd compared to the British one and whether they\\'ll laugh louder or less during certain scenes,\" Baynton told Mashable. He admits that since Hulu was involved from the start, he and Corden tried not to include anything \"too absurdly British or niche.\" Phil and Sam are unlikely bumbling action heroes. As in many other British comedies, the main characters are painted as down-on-their-luck losers: Sam has trouble moving on from a recent breakup, Phil is a 31-year-old mail clerk.  They\\'re not really losers (well, not both of them), and they\\'re not exactly dumb — in fact, they can be pretty clever at time. However, they sometimes say stupid things or waste time heating up microwave food at the convenience store when in a life-or-death time crunch. They\\'re relatable everymen, at least to the kind of people who would watch a British action comedy on Hulu.  As in Gavin and Stacey, Corden once again plays a useless idiot character, the foil to a slightly nerdy, attractive leading man. Here, Baynton inhabits that role quite well. The two men have great chemistry as friends, which makes sense since they wrote the series together and presumably are pals in real life.    The Wrong Mans has a distinctly British sense of humor amid all of its action, with few laugh-out-loud jokes. It\\'s funny when Phil doesn\\'t realize how to properly play a movie quote guessing game or when the office drones don\\'t have the foresight to realize taking a hostage means having to dispose of his excrement in a plastic bag.  \"I\\'m gonna miss all this: running around, having a hostage,\" Phil says during a happier time, before the hostage situation goes awry. Or perhaps the jokes only land with a chuckle because they\\'re cloaked in such slick, cinematic-looking direction. Pooling resources with the BBC allows for increased production value; there\\'s a spectacular car crash in the first three minutes, a gasoline fire in episode two, a jump onto a moving train in the finale and some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes in practically every installment. It\\'s more of a thriller with comedic elements than a full-on comedy, with the half-hour run time an awkward length to fully highlight either element.    The Wrong Mans is a good show, but it\\'s not a great one. It\\'s well produced, well acted and well plotted, but it\\'s not necessarily well-paced. There are certainly pros and cons regarding Hulu\\'s staggered release schedule versus Netflix\\'s all-at-once dump. In this case, Hulu\\'s approach may be more appropriate. The Wrong Mans is entertaining, but it doesn\\'t benefit from a binge watch, although all six episodes are available immediately for Hulu Plus subscribers.  Thirty-minute doses are just fine, thankyouverymuch. Some audiences would probably appreciate three solid hours of explosions, chases, kidnappings and cliffhangers, but for the most part, mainlining this show at once means the cliffhangers aren\\'t very effective. At a certain point, Twitter seems much more interesting than learning the outcome of said cliffhangers. Even six episodes can get tedious after a little while. Hulu is a logical home for The Wrong Mans, since the site already exclusively hosts other popular UK series such as Misfits and The Thick of It. Now that Hulu Plus is streaming Doctor Who, Sherlock, Top Gear and more, Anglophiles should recognize Hulu as a bonafide British TV hub. But it hasn\\'t found quite as much luck as Netflix in the original series department. It doesn\\'t have as high profile a project as Arrested Development, nor has it had any out-of-the-gate hits such as House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black.   Hulu is hoping The Wrong Mans is its shot at legitimizing its efforts with some award show consideration. But there\\'s something that doesn\\'t quite land here. It makes you smile at times and it certainly looks great, but it doesn\\'t have that addictive, watercooler conversation quality it needs to garner any sort of critical or viral buzz. Corden and Baynton, with the help of their production team, have created a solid series in The Wrong Mans. It\\'s amusing and gorgeous, and the title adeptly expresses both the espionage element and the comedic tone. The show did well on the BBC, and the duo has expressed interest in making a second season.  \"Regardless of whether we want to do a second season or if anyone is asking us to do it, which they are very kindly, we wouldn\\'t do it until we had something right,\" Jim Field Smith, the show\\'s writer and director, told Mashable. \"But how do you revisit that world without feeling like you\\'re retreading the same material? The moment we come up with a story or a hook we really like, then we\\'ll really start in earnest, but at this point in time we\\'re just kicking around ideas.\"  There\\'s potential for a sequel, but it\\'s not necessary. A comedy thriller is a difficult genre to nail; perhaps that\\'s why there are so few examples in existence. Coming up with another story that would be just as engaging seems like an impossible feat. The first two episodes of The Wrong Mans are available for free now, and subsequent episodes will roll out weekly. For Hulu Plus users, all six episodes are available now.  Images: Hulu ',\n",

       " ' There appear to be very few limits where the \"quantified self\" movement can go, especially if this piece of baby monitoring equipment designed to give parents peace of mind is anything to go by. Mimo is a connected onesie that monitors a baby’s sleep and feeds the information back to parents using an integrated smartphone app. For some it may seem like technology gone too far, but it could address the very real problem of 4,000 infants who die suddenly every year in the U.S., often with no obvious cause. Many of these deaths occur during sleep, so Mimo alleviates any fears parents might have by letting them know everything is all right and setting off an alarm when things are not. Available on a crowdfunding site Thursday, the baby jumpsuit kit will cost $200. It comes with three organic cotton onesies that act as respiration sensors, a toy turtle clip that monitors movement and a Wi-Fi base station shaped like a lily pad that is fully equipped with a microphone.  The app that goes along with the equipment is available for Android and iPhone, collecting important information displaying events such as how many times your baby has rolled over in the night, longest nap and other changes over time. The company that made the device also had to deal with concerns over choking hazards and making sure their wearable technology is still appealing to mothers, making them confident enough to put their infants in such a device.

       " ' We all know that birth order has some kind of affect on how our personalities are perceived by our family members, but according to findings recently published in Current Biology, it also affects how our bodies are perceived. Specifically, it makes everyone mistakenly think that the youngest in each family appears smaller than they really are. A group of researchers from Swinburne University in Melbourne rounded up a bunch of mothers whose kids were in the 2- to -6-year-old age range and asked them to estimate exactly how tall their children were by marking a featureless wall. They then compared these estimates to the actual height of each child. When it came to children with younger siblings, the moms usually hit pretty close to the actual height, but when they guessed the heights of children who were the youngest in their family (or if they only had one child), they fell short at an average of about three inches, which might not seem like much, but every fraction of an inch counts when you’re 4 years old. In addition to the wall-marking test, researchers also conducted an online survey of 747 mothers, 70% of whom confirmed that their first child suddenly looked much bigger after the birth of their second child. Their write-up in Current Biology states a possible theory for why this “baby illusion” takes place in the first place: because “exaggerating the smallness of the younger child [...] would help parents to more readily distinguish relative age and importance of care at a perceptual level and allocate resources accordingly.” So basically, if a parent thinks younger child as smaller, they’ll also think of that child as more helpless and needy, which keeps them from ignoring the kid completely in favor of their older siblings. The team also theorizes that in addition to an change in height perception, parents “could [also] notice a change in perceived age or perceived cuteness.” Yep, you heard it here first, folks — that wasn’t just 3-year-old paranoia you were feeling. Your parents really did think you were less cute after your younger siblings were born. But that’s OK, because that boost in cuteness was apparently the only thing keeping them alive, so it all works out for the best.

       " \" This post originally appeared on the American Express OPEN Forum, where Mashable regularly contributes articles about leveraging social media and technology in small business. Messaging is an important part of branding. Your marketing messages must capture your audience’s attention and compel them to action, whether they’re shopping in the store, browsing on your web site or recommending your product to a friend. And yet even the most seasoned marketers sometimes struggle to develop effective messaging. See also: Use These 10 Apps During Downtime “Many communicators forget that great messaging begins with their audience’s core values, not their product,” says Whitney Greer of branding consulting firm Brandularity. “When you’re not honing in on what people truly care about and coming across as authentic, your messages will miss the mark.” SEE ALSO: 9 Captivating Data Visualization Projects Here are five common reasons why messaging fails, and tips for avoiding these mistakes. 1. Not Speaking to Customers’ Values Too often, marketers orient messaging around what they believe to be the most important features of their product or service, instead of looking into what’s actually important to target customers. Take the time to understand your customers and their values, then align your messaging accordingly. One way to get insight into customer values is to ask them to complete a short survey, either in your store or online using a service such as SurveyMonkey. If your primary interaction with customers is in-store, you could even load up your online survey on an iPad and ask people to take the survey at the point of check-out for an instant discount. For example, a small chain of discount tire stores might use an in-store survey to compare what customers value. For example, the store may find out that while cost is important to its customers, “family” and “safety” are the two things they value most. The company could then shift its messaging from “lowest cost” to “keeping your family safe on a budget.” 2. Relying Too Heavily on Buzzwords Everyone wants to be part of a major trend, whether it’s being a “big data” company, a “slow food” restaurant or a “mompreneur.” The problem with relying on these buzzwords to define you is that the more popular they become, the less impact they have. People begin to simply tune them out. This doesn’t mean you can’t use popular category phrases at all. Just use them sparingly, and pair them with words that differentiate you and pack a unique punch. For example, natural skincare company TruKid does a great job of using the term “sustainable” in its company messaging in a subtle way that feels authentic: “TruKid nurtures kids through their daily play and is paving the way to innovative, sustainable body and hair care for the whole family — from babies to big kids!” 3. Failing to Make Your Messages Portable Many companies rely on word-of-mouth to drive business. Is your messaging “portable” enough for these customers to easily spread the word? One way to check is to try boiling your messaging down to just one or two sentences, creating the same type of “logline” Hollywood uses to sum up a movie or TV plot (such as “A young man and woman from different social classes fall in love aboard an ill-fated voyage at sea.”) If you can’t tell your story in 50 words or less, chances are your customers won’t be able to, either. Your logline should give people an idea of what you offer and provide some sort of hook to stimulate interest. For example, “a boutique PR agency that specializes in launching hot emerging tech companies” or “an accounting firm that deals exclusively with small-business audits.” Once you’ve got your logline, go back through your marketing copy and make sure these simple messages come through loud and clear. You can also use the logline itself in your marketing materials, on your web site and social media properties, and in conversations with customers and prospects. 4. Forgetting To Excite You know that sensation of arriving home after a short drive and not remembering any details of the drive? Much of our life is spent in this “auto-pilot” mode, making decisions based on our habits, emotions and gut instincts. It’s up to you to wake people up and inspire them with your messaging –- so infuse your language with as much excitement and energy as possible, and use action verbs rather than the passive voice. Here’s a great example of action-oriented messaging from cleaning product company Method: “It's time to clean happy ... with biodegradable products that clean like heck, smell like heaven and leave nothing nasty in their wake.” 5. Messaging By Committee When you fill a conference room with senior managers for a messaging session, it’s not unusual for everyone to have a different opinion about what the company does, accompanied by a strong need to be heard. The problem with this approach is that it often results in statements such as this one: “Our mission is to help innovative leaders in the CPG industry increase the velocity of their business and drive engagement with their social communities to inspire meaningful change.” This mission statement is likely suffering from “whiteboarditis”: the inflammation that occurs when someone crams everything from the whiteboard into one sentence. (It may also have a case of groupthink, in which fresh concepts surfaced by the team got boiled down into familiar jargon out of the need for consensus). Compare the clunky mission statement above to this simple, powerful example from Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose mission it is “to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.” Your messaging shouldn’t sound like it was fused together in a lab. While it’s valuable to get multiple opinions, don’t fall into the trap of trying to please everyone in the room. Stay true to your audience’s values, be authentic and communicate in straightforward terms. By the way, even Fortune 500 companies make these mistakes –- check out this list of Fortune 500 Mission Statements and see which ones you think miss the mark. It’s worth noting that some of these have already been improved since the list was created.

       " \" ‘Tis the season for airplane travel. We may be looking forward to getting where we’re going, but most aspects of the travel itself are merely endured. There’s stressful security, the madding crowd and the scrum at boarding, where people and their myriad belongings clog the gate area, standing between you and your departure. But take heart: there are scientifically proven ways to improve the boarding process or at least speed it up so that it can be over and done with more quickly. What’s going wrong now Currently, it feels like you could have walked to your destination by the time you’ve waited through boarding calls for all the various levels of travelers, from elite down to the dregs of refundable coach. Moreover, once you scan your pass and enter the jetway, you find it’s packed with all those who were crammed up around the ticket scanner a few minutes before – affectionately called “gate lice.” One big contributor to this logjam is the common airline policy to charge for checked baggage, leading passengers to bring aboard more, and more fully packed, luggage. All these carry-ons take time to stow. The fuller the plane becomes, the longer it takes to put the luggage away – like a not-very-fun version of Tetris. Another cause is the boarding process itself: the way and order that passengers are asked to board. You might assume the fastest way to load a plane is from the back to the front, so that no passenger needs to pass anyone in the aisle or hop over anyone in their row. This logic forms the basis of standard boarding procedures. But what would really happen if you boarded in precisely this way? The passengers would rush into the cabin, proceed toward the back – and come to a screeching halt as the first one or two passengers stow their luggage. The first 30 passengers (the back five rows) would take up nearly the entire length of the cabin. The rest of the line has simply moved from the airport gate into the jetway or cabin – and it moves no faster. The leap from serial to parallel The problem is that boarding from the back to the front is a serial process: only one action at a time is completed. It’s like deleting a page of text just using the delete key instead of selecting the entire page. In this case, only one passenger at a time is seated. The aisle in the airplane isn’t used effectively. A more efficient way to board would have only as many passengers in the airplane as can put their luggage away without interfering with each other. Those passengers should also be ordered so as to eliminate the need to pass by anyone either in the aisle or in the rows. In other words, it is better to make passenger boarding a parallel process where multiple actions occur simultaneously, instead of a serial process. An optimum method Virtually all scientific or industrial fields have optimization problems: finding the best way to complete different tasks. A classic example is the “traveling salesman” problem: what’s the shortest route that connects a number of cities?  The same optimization routine that can solve the traveling salesman problem can be applied to airplane boarding. Drawing from its results, I’ve proposed an optimum boarding method. In this approach, often called the Steffen method, adjacent passengers in line will be seated two rows apart from each other. The first wave of passengers would be, in order, 30A, 28A, 26A, 24A, and so on, starting from the back. (For a typical airplane there would be 12 such waves, one for each seat in a row and for odd and even rows.)  Seating map showing the order that passengers board using the Steffen method.Image:  Jason SteffenIn field tests, this method has outperformed all others. In a test with 72 passengers it was nearly twice as fast as boarding back-to-front or in rotating blocks of rows, methods commonly used in the industry. It was 20-30% faster than more optimized boarding methods such as random boarding, when people get on without regard to where their assigned seats are. It also beat boarding windows-middle-aisle. My method even outperformed the industry gold standard of open seating, used by Southwest airlines. That’s when passengers don’t have assigned seats at all. Can we make the switch? So, why isn’t this optimum method of airplane boarding being adopted by any carrier in the industry? One significant reason may be the challenge of its implementation – lining passengers up in such a rigid order. While this obstacle may not be insurmountable, the question itself overlooks one of the primary benefits of the Steffen method: it allows an airline to measure how much room there is for improvement and identifies where that improvement is to be found. A head-to-head comparison between an existing strategy and the Steffen method (incorporating all of the different elite and special-needs passengers) might show that a 30% reduction in boarding time is possible. Then, the powers-that-be can weigh the cost of changing to a more efficient, yet still practical process – one that more effectively uses the aisle – against the benefit of recovering only a portion of that potential savings. Those are the kinds of numbers that decisions can be based upon – and it eliminates the common, but utterly useless, defense of “there’s always room for improvement.” Cold comfort on your flight this week, perhaps. Maybe spend some of your time standing in line spreading the word that a better way is possible.

Image:  Mashable, Luke Leonard         Compact Charger, But Limited Battery Life Battery life isn\\'t great: only 3.3 hours on a single charge. But don\\'t fret, the canvas-wrapped charging case is really slick and holds two additional charges.  Image:  Mashable, Luke Leonard         Power in the Palm of Your Hand, or Ear This little guy is really tiny. It\\'s one of the smallest Bluetooth headsets ever created; it\\'s half as long as a Jawbone Era and doesn\\'t dangle on the side of your face.  Image:  Mashable, Luke Leonard         Smartphone-Ready, If You Have the Right One  The Hint has a range of 150 feet and is compatible with non-Motorola Android smartphones and iPhones. You won\\'t get the touchless Moto Voice features, but you can access Google Now and Siri by pressing the button. You can also answer calls with your voice.  Image:  Mashable, Luke Leonard       Smartwatches and fitness trackers are fighting for your wrists. Google Glass is still trying to win your face. But who\\'s trying to put a modern wearable in your ear?  Everyone knows there is nothing sexy about wearing a Bluetooth headset in your ear. Motorola wants to change that perception with its $150 Moto Hint, a tiny wireless earbud that lets you control your smartphone with your voice and get bite-sized Google Now information served into your ear. The Hint is a promising product, with a good reason to exist, but its weakness is that it only works best with two of Motorola\\'s own phones: the Moto X and the Droid Turbo. What you get Although the Hint looks like a hearing aid, it\\'s not — it does a great deal more. It has one button to press and two microphones (one to listen to your voice and the other to isolate ambient noise).  You\\'ll also notice that the Hint doesn\\'t have a power button. That\\'s because it uses an infrared proximity sensor to detect when it\\'s in your ear and when it\\'s not — neat! The Hint\\'s carrying case is pretty cool, too: it\\'s a storage case and a power charger. At home, you can plug a micro USB cable into the bottom to recharge the Hint, and when you\\'re outside, the case acts like a tiny battery bank with enough power to recharge the earbud twice. Make sure you don\\'t leave the case at home; the Hint\\'s battery is only good for up to 3.3 hours of talk time. Believe me when I say you\\'ll need those two extra charges to last through an entire day. The case/charger has a rubber loop on top so you can attach it to your keys. I highly recommend doing this because if you misplace or lose the charging case, you\\'re kind of screwed; there\\'s no way to get a replacement without buying a brand new Hint. All about the fit As with any wearable, how well it fits is incredibly important. I have small ears and while I expected the Hint to fall out, it never did. The Hint still stuck halfway out of my ear, but once I jammed it in, it stayed in place. Even skateboarding around Central Park didn\\'t knock it out. Worrywarts will be happy to know the Hint also comes with gel tips in three sizes, similar to how in-ear earbuds come with different sized tips. On a few days of testing, I walked into the shower with the Hint still in my ear. (Be warned: It\\'s not water-resistant or waterproof.) That\\'s how small and forgettable it becomes in your ear. Fashion-conscious minds also have a reason to get excited: the Hint is available in three different surface materials: wood, leather and canvas — two finishes for each for a total of six options to pick from. Better with Moto X and Droid Turbo Like all devices that support voice recognition, when the Hint works, it\\'s the most magical thing ever. But when it fails to understand or makes you look at your phone, you can\\'t help but realize how limited the technology is right now. I\\'m a realist when it comes to using voice commands; I was burned by Kinect and Siri when they launched. Google Now is more accurate when it comes to understanding natural language and it\\'s constantly being improved, but it still messes up at times. The Hint works best when it\\'s paired to either the Moto X or Droid Turbo — phones with Moto Voice and Moto Assist. Moto Voice lets you control virtually the entire phone by speaking to it and Moto Assist lets your phone read your text messages to you. Again, these two features are baked right into those two phones and you don\\'t need the Hint to use them. The device allows you use those functions up to 150 feet away. It\\'s a nice convenience to have, if you need it, but by no means necessary for a lot of people.  Image: Mashable, Luke LeonardVoice answer roulette To activate the Hint\\'s voice recognition, you can say the Moto X or Droid Turbo\\'s custom voice prompt (mine was \"Hello, Samantha\") and wait to hear a little tone before you give it a command. Or you can press the Hint itself and then speak your command. In a quiet office and at home, the Hint worked almost perfectly every time (assuming you don\\'t have any kind of thick accent). Using the Hint outside was a different story. The Hint had problems hearing me say \"Hello, Samanatha\" while on the noisy subway and taxi-honking streets of New York City; I usually had to repeat myself several times until it heard, or until I gave up and just pressed the button. For what it\\'s worth, talking to the Hint in public still made me look like a complete weirdo to people around me. Making calls is as simple as saying \"Call John Doe\" or \"Dial 123-456-7890.\" To answer incoming calls you can say \"Answer\" or \"Ignore.\"  The Hint is also great for tapping into Google Maps for directions. To get driving directions, just say \"Navigate to [the name of a street].\" To get walking or biking directions you can say \"Walking\" or \"Biking\" directions to [your destination].  You can say \"Take a Selfie\" to turn on the front camera with a countdown timer. You can create a reminder or or send messages on WhatsApp or update a status on Facebook. There are over 20 commands you can use.  On top of those commands, you can also ask questions and Google will pull up relevant results. Here\\'s where things go a little sideways. For example, when a person in your Google contacts calls you, the Hint will read their name, but when you get one from anyone else, it\\'ll tell you to look at your phone to see the number instead of reading you the number. The same applies to things like translating a phrase. The Hint can tell you how to say \"How much is that\" in French and Italian, but it can\\'t do so in Greek. It can tell you how to say \"That is delicious\" in Japanese, but not in Chinese Mandarin. For answers the Hint can\\'t read, it\\'ll ask you to look at your phone. It\\'s a little annoying because you never know if you will get an answer in your ear or not. If you have to see the answer on your phone anyway, why bother getting a Hint in the first place?  Image:  Mashable,  Luke LeonardNot so hands-free with other phones Pairing the Hint with the Moto X or Droid Turbo gives you the best hands-free experience, since you get the added Moto Voice enhancements. But what happens when you connect it to an iPhone or other Android device?  You can\\'t just speak to it like you would when paired to a phone with Moto Voice. You need to press the Hint every single time in order activate Google Now (Android) or Siri (iPhone).  If your phone doesn\\'t support Google Now or Siri, then the Hint functions as a regular Bluetooth headset — you can answer calls with it. Exciting indeed. Wait for version 2.0 The Hint is an interesting attempt at breathing new life into boring Bluetooth headsets. The problem is, unless you have a Moto X or Droid Turbo (phones with Moto Voice), the Hint isn\\'t worth it; it\\'s mostly an overpriced Bluetooth headset.  Sure, it\\'s really tiny — half the length of a Jawbone Era — but the 3.3 hours of talk time, tinny audio and inconsistent voice recognition don\\'t justify the $150 price. Voice commands are convenient to use, especially if you need to free up your hands for other things (like when you\\'re cooking or driving), but it\\'s not a must-have for everyone. The Hint has a lot of potential as a new wearable product category, but it needs more time in the oven.  Moto Hint ($150)   The Good Comfy to wear all day • Sweet charging case • Comes in six different styles The Bad Pricey • Noise cancellation needs more work • Battery life is mediocre The Bottom Line The Moto Hint is a quirky wearable earbud that sounds like a game changer on paper, but in reality is little more than a really tiny Bluetooth headset, unless you own either a Moto X or Droid Turbo.

       " ' SYDNEY — Gough Whitlam, the long-lived 21st prime minister of Australia, died on Tuesday aged 98. Whitlam was the only prime minister to be alive in the lifetime of all 27 Australian prime ministers. The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton, died in 1920, while the second, Alfred Deakin, passed away in 1919. Young Whitlam graced the world with his presence in 1916.

Dying will happen sometime. As you know, I plan for the ages, not just for this life.\"   He lived for another 18 years after saying that.

The cause of death has not been released. \"Our father, Gough Whitlam, has died this morning at the age of 98,\" his family said in the statement. \"A loving and generous father, he was a source of inspiration to us and our families and for millions of Australians.\"  The death of Gough Whitlam: family statement. pic.twitter.com/mOvycILopY — Mark Scott (@mscott) October 20, 2014  Leading the Labor party from 1967 to 1977, Whitlam is considered a defining figure in Australian politics. He served as prime minister from 1972 to 1975, gaining power for Labor for the first time in 23 years.  Whitlam was dramatically dismissed by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr in 1975, in what is generally known as the greatest constitutional crisis in Australian politics and the only time in history the head of state has used its powers to dismiss the current government.  Gough Whitlam in 1975, the year of his dismissal.Image: David Austen / Getty ImagesIt followed a stalemate in the parliament\\'s Senate, where Labor did not hold the balance of power. Opposition leader Malcolm Fraser refused to pass budget bills unless an election was called. Whitlam refused, and to end the stand-off which had dragged on for months, Kerr dismissed Whitlam and put Fraser in his place. It is considered a defining moment in Australian politics.  The current Liberal Party Prime Minister Tony Abbott paid tribute to Whitlam, who was considered extremely divisive in his time in political career, this morning. \"He united the Australian Labor Party, won two elections and seemed in so many ways, larger than life,\" Abbott said. \"In his own party, he inspired a legion of young people to get involved in public life.\" Tributes have flooded Twitter, praising the former leader for the economic and cultural reforms he put in place during his tumultuous time in office.

The news of their sentencing was confirmed on Twitter by several people inside of Iran.   اعضای گروه هپی به شش ماه حبس و ۹۱ضربه شلاق محکوم شدند که این حکم سه سال تعلیقی ست و اگر در این مدت جرم دیگری بکنند، این حکم اجرا می شود! — Behnam2k (@behnam2k) September 17, 2014   The other members of the \"Happy\" video group were sentenced to 6 months+91 lashes, suspended for 3 years #Iran #HumanRights — Persian Banoo (@persianbanoo) September 17, 2014  The director of the video, Sassan Soleimani (or Sasan Solaymani), reportedly treceived the longer sentence of one year in prison.

While in prison, they were made to confess on national television.  The reasons behind the arrests were initially unclear, but Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian freelance journalist based in Washington, D.C., told Mashable at the time that it was likely because the video depicted men and women dancing together, and the women were not wearing hijabs.  In fact, the court found them guilty of \"participation in the making of a vulgar clip\" and \"illegitimate relations between members of the group,\" according to the nonprofit International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.

       " ' Four weeks ago, Facebook launched Facebook Home, a launcher for Android that brings the social network\\'s experience front and center. The company on Thursday invited a small group of reporters to its campus to discuss Facebook Home, its successes and challenges, and what we can expect to see added to the platform in the future. “We’re at just about 1 million downloads on Home,” Facebook\\'s Director of Mobile Engineering Cory Ondrejka told the group, a number which he says is about where Facebook wanted to be at this time. He didn\\'t, however, share how many of those 1 million downloads were currently active users of the app. The company says that while number will be important to them in the future, right now it\\'s focusing on the engagement level of those current active users, however many there happen to be.  “This is the first product for us that has focused on mobile best,” Ondrejka said. Mobile best is different than Facebook’s focus on \"mobile first.\" Home is the first product the company has created with an intention to make mobile better than the experience you might get elsewhere. “We’re doing a relatively slow roll out intentionally,” says Ondrejka, so Facebook can learn from early adopters, and make changes as necessary.  From that slow roll out –- and reviews in Google Play — Facebook has learned a bit about what people love about the launcher, and what’s missing. “We’ve spent a lot of time digging through the one star ratings,” says Ondrejka.  Ondrejka says there are two major features that weren’t in Home at launch that people really think the launcher needs. The first is folders, and the second is docks. Facebook has fixes to both issues in the works, with plans to release those features in future updates. During the event, we were given a quick look at what that feature will look like when it is released.  Another growth point for Facebook with Home is its \"chat heads\" feature. Users believe the feature is great for continuing a conversation, but not as useful when it comes to starting one. To help alleviate that issue, Facebook is planning to add a new buddy list from Facebook home where users can pull out a list of their friends to initiate a conversation.  Facebook Home is currently only officially available on the HTC One X or One X+, Samsung’s Galaxy S III, or the Galaxy Note II. The app also comes pre-loaded on the HTC First from AT&T. Facebook says the app has also been sideloaded onto over 10,000 unsupported devices by industrious Android users. Facebook Home is currently sitting at a 2.2 star rating in Google Play. Facebook Home will be updated monthly starting today with primarily a bug-fixing update and is scheduled to receive another update July 11. The features shown off today will be released in the coming months. What features do you hope to see in Facebook Home in the future? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

       " \" When Vine prankster Lele Pons recently broke the 1 billion loop milestone, I realized we finally had proof that the view measuring system Vine introduced on July 1 is a crock. Lele, who famously “does it for the Vine,” has over 3.4 million Vine followers and many of her humorous and sometimes outrageous six-seconds bits have millions of loops. I’m sure she earned the loops — but how hard is it to earn them?  For instance, as I type this, one of Lele Pons' less shocking Vine videos is looping over and over again in the background.  I can glance over and watch the loop number rise. It actually jumps because, I think, a number of other people around the world are viewing her Vine videos at the same time.  Because of the way Vine works, with continuous looping, each person is probably worth 10, 20 or more loops per viewing session.  The only way to stop a Vine video loop is by clicking on the video. Most of these Vine video viewers, like me, probably stopped paying attention after the first few loops.  See also: The Ultimate Breakdown of the Weird World of Vine Glancing up at my bowser screen right now I realize I have at least three tabs open that are looping vines in the background (I can tell because the looping sound is still coming through my attached headphones — it’s mind-numbing).  So these Vine members are collecting loops without me even watching the videos. [Update: Vine recently updated its FAQ to clarify that Vine loops will only be counted/generated when browsers tabs and mobile screens are visible.] With loops being so easy to collect and seen, by many, as a measure of popularity, I envision some enterprising Viners hiring a few Vine farm workers to harvest loops during the day while they do other things. Maybe they pay them $1 per 1,000 loops. Compare to YouTube As you can tell, I have a problem with loops, at least as a measure of anything. One only has to look at YouTube and how it tracks views to understand why I have trouble believing Vine loops are worth all that much. YouTube videos are a fundamentally different animal than Vine videos. Most are minutes long and, while they may auto-play, they never loop. It’s more likely that the next video in a playlist will launch at the end of the video you just watched. Increasingly, to see a good YouTube video, you really have to want it. The spread of pre-roll ads means you either have to wait or at least click a link to skip an ad before that “awmazing” video of a cat playing the ukulele finally starts playing.  Some Vine videos are ads or 100%-sponsored by brands, but there’s no such thing as a pre-roll on a six second video. The commitment to watch a Vine video or even see a full one as you walk by a monitor is impressively low.  Like Vine, YouTube doesn’t say much about how it counts a video view (do you have to watch the whole thing?). The most viewed YouTube videos are listed here. The most watch YouTube video, ever, Psy’s Gangnam Style, took two years to reach that plateau. Justin Bieber’s Baby took four years to top 1 billion views. Easy numbers Want to know how easy it is to collect Vine loops? I have over 3 million of them . (For the sake of comparison, Mashable’s Vine account has over 99,000 followers and over 7 million loops.) How did I collect so many with just 3,168 followers?   A look at my most popular Vine videos highlights the broken relationship between Vine loops and likes. My Jibo family robot Vine video, for example, has 175 likes.  Respectable, but how does that account for 177,000 loops? My Rotimatic Vine video has 172 likes and over 800,000 loops.  These numbers make no sense until you consider that Vine, like YouTube, counts embedded plays.  When I wrote about the robotic Roti maker on Mashable, I naturally embedded the Vine video of it in action. That post generated an above average 65,000 social media interactions on Mashable and it generated at least twice that much traffic.  Even if readers spent just a few minutes on that page, they’d generate 30 loops per visit. It would only take 25,000 unique readers to collect 750,000 loops.  When I contacted Vine, which is owned by Twitter, about Vine loop counts, they said they didn’t have any data to share around specific users and their loop count numbers. Better than before Not everyone shares my dim view of Vine loops.  I caught up with Allen Adamson, chairman of Landor, brand advising business.  He thinks loops are an improvement over Likes. “Marketers are starving for metrics and anything they can use to show they’ve got eyeballs and the eyeballs are on the content is mission critical,” said Adamson, who has been advising brands for 20 years. Adamson told me he agrees that there is an open question on the quality of that engagement. “What are people doing while looking at this? How attentive are they?” Marketers, he told me, what to know if consumers are multitasking while the video plays. When I noted that some Vines will play in hidden tabs, Adamson said that all goes back to the quality of the views. Even so, he said it’s too early to judge loops. Most interestingly, though, Adamson see’s the comparison to YouTube views in a very different way.  He told me a view on Vine might be “a little better, because its shorter content. The shorter the message the higher the likelihood people are paying attention.” For now, though, even Vine isn’t relying too heavily on loop counts, at least to measure popularity. In its FAQ, Vine notes that loop counts do not impact what shows up on the platform’s “Popular Now” tab. And while I’m not convinced that 1 billion loops = 1 billion views (or that that is even Vine’s intention), Vine does scrub loop counts for spam and other kinds of abuse. “As a result, it might be that loop counts fluctuate from time to time,” notes the FAQ. I’ll admit, I got kind of excited when I first saw my own loop numbers. They were so much higher than I expected, especially considering my generally low like and re-vine counts. However, I soon realized they had about as much value as Monopoly money.  It’s fun to collect those orange $500 bills, but don’t go walking into your local Best Buy with them. Similarly, I wouldn’t brag too much about loop counts right now. \",\n",
       " ' PriceGrabber, a price-comparison shopping site, has acquired two-year-old shopping app Snapette for an undisclosed amount. Snapette is designed to connect iPhone and Android owners with fashion merchandise in nearby stores. The company has partnered with more than 200 brands and retailers — some large, such as Nine West and Joie, others small. Together, they serve users an Instagram-like feed of new products as they arrive in stores. Snapette will continue to operate as an independent company under PriceGrabber, and its nine-person team has moved to a new office in New York. (PriceGrabber is headquartered in L.A.)  Snapette users won\\'t notice any difference in the apps, including the appearance of PriceGrabber branding, Sarah Paiji (pictured left), co-founder and CEO of Snapette, told Mashable in a phone interview Monday. That said, Snapette is planning on a strategy shift, one that\\'s been in place before acquisition talks with PriceGrabber began. Instead of trying to draw users into stores, Paiji said she and her team want to bring transactions into the app, which is something users have been asking for. The move will allow Snapette to show retailers that it really is making an impact. Currently, it\\'s difficult to prove whether the app is driving consumers into stores.  Snapette started meeting with PriceGrabber at the beginning of this year to see how the startup could leverage PriceGrabber\\'s catalog of approximately 12,000 merchants, according to Paiji. Eventually, those conversations moved towards acquisition: PriceGrabber was looking for a company with mobile expertise, and Snapette wanted to expand to the web.  \"The timing was right,\" Paiji said. \"We raised a round at the end of 2011, and so it was time for us to start thinking about doing another round [or] an exit.\" She added that Snapette\\'s original vision — connecting smartphone users with local shops — is ahead of its time: \"I do strongly believe it will get resolved in the next one to two years.\" But for now, the company will focus on online transactions, expanding to the web and the iPad.  Snapette marks one of the first successful exits for a fashion-related mobile technology startup to date. Between 2009 and 2011, a range of startups in the category — Pose, Snapette, Fashism, GoTryItOn — were able to raise as much as seven figures to launch their ideas. Since then, however, they have struggled to turn the ideas into real businesses. Pose is building an advertising platform, but GoTryItOn has folded, its founder now employed by another fashion startup called Rent the Runway. Fashism hasn\\'t raised any capital since its Series A round nearly three years ago. Snapette has raised only a single round of funding, amounting to $1.5 million, from venture capital firms and angel investors, including Shoedazzle and The Honest Company founder Brian Lee. The startup has kept the rest of its investment roster private. Images: Snapette ',\n",
       " ' Governor Jerry Brown will sign a bill to ban plastic bags in California, he said in gubernatorial debate Thursday night. The legislation, which passed the state Senate on Aug. 29, will make California the first state in the country to comprehensively outlaw thin, single-use plastic bags.  The debate\\'s moderator, John Myers, senior editor at KQED News had asked: \"One of the most talked about bills at the state capitol this year was the statewide ban on plastic bags. So let me ask you the simple question first: paper or plastic?\" See also: California\\'s Cellphone \\'Kill Switch\\' Law: What You Need to Know “I probably will sign it, yes,” Brown replied. “In fact, I’ll tell you why I’m going to sign it …. There are about 50 cities with their own plastic bag ban, and that’s causing a lot of confusion.\" Environmentalists, of course, support the ban. Californians Against Waste claims that California spends between $34 and $107 million dollars on plastic bag cleanup every year. They say bags also threaten marine life, particularly sea turtles who mistake them for jellyfish floating in the water and eat them.  Plastic bag manufacturers and state Republicans are opposed, arguing that the ban will cost jobs and represents governmental overreach. Neel Kashkari, who\\'s running against Brown for governor, though trailing in the polls, disapproved too.   Poverty? Jobs? Education? Rebuilding the middle class? Nope. Plastic bags. #embarrassing — Neel Kashkari (@neelkashkari) August 28, 2014  The bill will prohibit grocery stores and large pharmacies from using plastic bags as of July 1 2015, and expand to include convenience stores by 2016, according to the Associated Press. It also provides $2 million in loans and grants to help manufacturers retrain workers and adapt to producing reusable bags.  The bill\\'s passage was marked by legislative struggle and compromise. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union had pulled their support for the ban earlier that week, but changed their minds after the bill was amended to allow grocers to charge at least $0.10 for reusable bags.  Senate President pro Tempore-elect Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) had opposed previous plastic bag bans in part because a bag manufacturer is located in his district. He supported this bill after provisions were added to protect manufacturers, according to the Associated Press. One such provision: the $2 million in manufacturing loans. “This is a compromise,” Brown said. “It’s taking into account the needs of the environment, and the needs of the economy and the needs of the grocers.”       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' The modern-day city dweller has numerous transportation options, whether it\\'s car, train, bike or even trolley. But finding the ever-elusive parking space, waiting out train delays and competing with rush hour traffic on your average 10-speed bike don\\'t exactly optimize your commute. Some commuters are starting to adopt a more efficient, eco-friendly way to get around their cities — the electric dicycle. SEE ALSO: 8 Solar-Powered Mobile Chargers  Also known as a diwheel, the dicycle differs from single-track vehicles like motorcycles and bicycles because its two wheels are side-by-side. Picture the Segway Personal Transporter (PT) — the dicycle\\'s inner frame typically balances on an axle between two parallel wheels, allowing it to pivot or rotate. The dicycle concept has actually been around for more than 130 years, patented in the 1880s by E.C.F. Otto. It was considered a safer alternative to the bicycle, which first appeared earlier in the century. Benefits of the Dicycle Electric dicycles produce fewer emissions than motorcycles since they don\\'t use gas, which in turn can reduce pollution. They\\'re also more efficient in several ways; Segway, for example, prides itself on its energy efficiency, saying that the use of electric dicycles has the potential to reduce dependence on foreign oil and allows us to use the existing energy supply more efficiently. The electric dicycle can also be more efficient than the average bicycle as far as time and effort are concerned. Instead of manually pedaling, you\\'re operating an automatic vehicle, which can reach higher speeds than the average 10-15 miles per hour of a bicycle.  Lastly, the dicycle has the potential to be safer than motorcycles or bicycles (depending on design and other conditions, of course). The dicycle\\'s wheel design is all about balance, meaning the rider is less likely to fall (and the UNO III\\'s three-wheel transformation is more a safety function than anything else). Additionally, since dicycle riders will use paths and lower-risk roads instead of highways, the chance for accidents is far lower. Since we\\'ve seen such immense technological advances since the introduction of the dicycle, it shouldn\\'t come as much of a surprise that companies and individuals have innovated with the original dicycle idea. What\\'s really interesting is how they\\'ve reworked the dicycle, each one innovative in vastly different ways. The following three companies look to bring the two-wheeled vehicle to urban dwellers.  1. The Segway PT   The most popular example of the dicycle is the Segway PT, used around the world for commuting, city tours, exploring parks, traversing golf courses and even for law enforcement (as shown in the video above). In 1999, inventor Dean Kamen founded the company with a vision of creating vehicle that was small, maneuverable and had zero emissions. By 2001, the first Segway PT was created, and it was unveiled on Good Morning America. Since then, Segway has released numerous PT models, won various awards and even worked with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to convert Segway PTs into Robotic Mobility Platforms (RMPs) for Mars missions. In 2008, the Beijing Summer Olympics delegates used more than 100 Segway PTs, which were selected for their environmentally friendliness.  Forty-four states have adopted specific laws allowing and regulating Segway use. 2. The UNO III   When Benjamin Gulak was a high school senior in Ontario, Canada, he visited China with his father and witnessed the country\\'s prevalent smog pollution caused by motor vehicles. As a result of his trip, Gulak wanted to create an eco-friendly alternative to gas-powered automobiles. He founded BPG Werks and created the UNO, a stylish dicycle reminiscent of motorcycles, complete with wheelchair motors, batteries and gyroscopes. Originally Gulak\\'s high school science fair project, the UNO was named one of Popular Mechanics\\' Inventions of the Year in 2008.  The third and most recent iteration, the UNO III (in the video above), is the most advanced — the rider can transform the frame from a dicycle to a three-wheeled motorbike, even while in motion. How\\'s that for mobility? 3. EDWARD   The Electric Diwheel With Active Rotation Damping, or simply EDWARD, might look a little funny if you ride it down the street, but it\\'s a pretty amazing creation. An honors project at the University of Adelaide in South Australia, EDWARD is innovative because it has what many other dicycle attempts lack — increased stability and slosh control to prevent \"gerbiling,\" which is the term for \"tumbling in aggressive braking or acceleration maneuvers,\" according to the EDWARD project page. With two giant wheels on either side of the seat, EDWARD can reach speeds of approximately 25 miles per hour and has a battery life of about one hour.  An extended overview and details about the project\\'s physics can be found here. Mashable composite, image via iStockphoto, Tomacco ',\n",
       " ' This may be the last thing you\\'d want to bump into on a walk home from the campus library. A sculpture of an underwear-clad sleepwalking man was recently installed at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and has left students seriously creeped out with its lifelike appearance. Sculptor Tony Matelli created the nearly-nude statue, titled \"Sleepwalker,\" as part of an ongoing exhibition at the school\\'s Davis Museum, according to The Boston Globe. See also: The 20 Scariest Google Street View Sightings  Image: AP Photo/Steven Senne/Associated PressNot long after the sculpture\\'s installation on Feb. 3, hundreds of students on the all-women\\'s campus signed a petition to remove the art piece. Zoe Magid, the student who created the Change.org petition, writes that the sculpture does not add value to the campus community, as art is often intended to do. On contrary, this highly lifelike sculpture has, within just a few hours of its outdoor installation, become a source of apprehension, fear and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault for many members of our campus community. While it may appear humorous or thought-provoking to some, it has already become a source of undue stress for many Wellesley College students, the majority of whom live, study and work in this space. Members of the campus community have also taken to social media to tweet photos of the controversial statue.  Seeing new sculptures around campus?

       " ' Joe Siegrist was dropping off his son at school on Tuesday morning when he got a phone call from his staff: Heartbleed was even worse than they thought.   News of the security bug first came out the previous day, April 7, after Siegrist and much of his team at LastPass, a password security company, had already left the office for the day. It wasn\\'t until the following morning they learned Heartbleed potentially allowed attackers to extract 64 kilobyte batches of memory at random. See also: The Heartbleed Hit List: The Passwords You Need to Change Right Now \"That is significantly worse than most bugs that occur,\" Siegrist, CEO of LastPass, told Mashable. \"You don\\'t know what exactly was in the payload of those Heartbleed messages: It could be user names and passwords. It could be financial data. It could be the SSL certificate, which is especially bad.\" \"It was definitely a \\'holy sh*t\\' moment,\" he says.  When Siegrist got to the company\\'s headquarters in Fairfax, Va., that morning, he addressed the entire office, briefing them on the updates and lay out the plan. Half of the developers, about eight people, dropped everything and focused on making sure any SSL certificates were revoked and reissued for LastPass.com. The other half of the team went to work on building a tool that would help users identify impacted websites and determine whether they should change their passwords right away, or wait. The LastPass Heartbleed checker was cited by a number of top publications and news programs and quickly became a go-to source for concerned Internet users to assess the risk posed by the security bug. The tool has had more than 3.8 million views in the less than a week since it launched, and it has been used for 4.5 million lookups.  Moreover, LastPass is seeing a tremendous surge in the number of people creating accounts. The company added 125,000 new users over the last week, compared to 35,000 or so in a normal week. LastPass is free, but a premium version sells for $1 a month.  \"It\\'s definitely good for business, which is a paradox,\" says Siegrist, who founded LastPass in 2008 and has been working to reach more of a mainstream audience. \"Do I want it to happen like this? No, I don\\'t. But if any good can come out of it...\"  1Password, a password management app, shot up into the top 10 iPhone apps after Heartbleed.LastPass isn\\'t the only password management service experiencing a surge in popularity as a result of the Heartbleed bug. 1Password, a service from AgileBits, saw a \"tenfold\" increase in traffic to its website and its paid iPhone app jumped into the top 10 in the U.S. last week from the low-200s previously. \"We are getting a lot of customers who have heard of Heartbleed and they haven\\'t really thought significantly of their internet security until now,\" says Jeff Shiner, CEO of 1Password. \"It\\'s one of those things that in peoples\\' minds is always happening to somebody else.\" Emmanuel Schalit, CEO of Dashlane, another password manager, says his company experienced a \"10x\" surge in new users at its peak over the last week. Traffic to Dashlane didn\\'t peak until a couple days after Heartbleed was discovered. As with the other password security companies we spoke with, traffic remains much higher than normal a week later. \"I think it\\'s going to last for awhile,\" Schalit says. \"The news story will die down as with any news story, but I think it will create a step change in the market and awareness.\" In an effort to keep the momentum going, Dashlane is suggesting customers tell their friends about the importance of taking extra password precautions. LastPass, meanwhile, is working to simplify its customer education tools so that its easier for new users to get started and stay engaged — with or without another Heartbleed. \"Before it was if you were in the know, you used a password manager, but it has always been a struggle to get that out to a mainstream audience,\" says Erin Styles, VP of marketing for LastPass.  \"We\\'re trying to set up better general education for getting started with one.\"  \"I think a lot of folks don\\'t know what a password manager does even when they sign up for one,\" Styles added.

       " ' Secretary of State John Kerry discussed President Obama\\'s plan for a military strike on Syria, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday afternoon. Kerry presented what he called a targeted strike intended to \"degrade and deter\" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\\'s ability to use chemical weapons. He stressed that this resolution will not land the U.S. in an extended war, promising no \"boots on the ground.\" See also: War in Syria: Interactive Map Outlines Major Battle Zones \"President Obama is not asking America to go to war,\" Kerry said.  Sitting beside Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kerry said it\\'s \"definitively in our national security interest\" to respond to hard proof that Assad\\'s regime carried out a large-scale chemical weapons strike against his own people. The White House on Friday declassified a four-page report on Syria\\'s use of chemical weapons. \"Hair and blood samples from first responders in East Damascus have tested positive for signatures of sarin,\" Kerry told the committee. Though congressional leaders from both parties have expressed support for Obama\\'s plan, the American public remains skeptical. A poll jointly conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News found that about six out of 10 people oppose attacking Syria. Kerry also attempted to mollify concerns about military action based on potentially faulty intel, calling the proof of Assad\\'s transgressions \"undeniable.\" Kerry was a senator during the passage of the Iraq War Resolution, and he voted \"yes\" on the measure, based on the belief that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction. \"Assad’s regime executed the worst chemical-weapons attack of the 21st century — that fact is beyond question,\" Kerry said. Committee chairman Sen. Robert Menendez, who voted against the war in Iraq as a member of the House of Representatives, opened the hearing by affirming his support for action in Syria. \"What message do we send the world when such a crime goes unpunished?\" Menendez asked. Kerry, Hagel and Dempsey argued throughout the hearing that intervention in Syria was necessary on several grounds, not just to uphold the the 1925 Geneva Protocol — which prohibits the use of chemical weapons (Syria signed in 1968) — but also to prevent a sort of chain reaction of \"emboldening\" other regimes such as Iran and North Korea. \"If we fail to act, we\\'re going to have fewer allies,\" Kerry said. Sen. Bob Corker, a ranking member of the Foreign Relations committee, called the decision one of the hardest any senator will have to make. As Kerry finished his remarks, a protestor had to be escorted from the room when she shouted, \"Nobody wants this war!\" Kerry stressed from his opening remarks that he thought debate would be crucial to this decision-making process. \"The world is watching not just to see what we decide, but how we make this decision,\" he said. \"They want to know if America will rise to this moment and make a difference.\" Members of Congress will learn about specific tactical elements of Obama\\'s intervention plan at closed-door meetings scheduled for Wednesday.

       " '  New software can now ID an animal\\'s gender and age based just on a picture of a footprint. This is how it works: Key elements uniquely identifying a footprint are marked on an image, as shown above with an Amur tiger print, prior to algorithmic classification. Studying animal behavior in the wild usually starts with figuring out just where the wild animals are hiding. Field biologists can use a combination of methods for this, such as radio collars, aerial surveys, and camera traps to remotely monitor animal movement. However, to an expert eye, a well-preserved footprint can also reveal a surprising amount about an animal: its species, gender, age, even its individual identity. The trick is being able to do the identifying accurately and quickly. Over the last decade, WildTrack, an organization founded by zoologist and veterinarian Zoe Jewell and her husband, Sky Alibhai, has been developing image processing software to detect physical footprint characteristics that are hard for an untrained eye to recognize. The organization\\'s software is being used to track a variety of animals in different habitats, including Amur tigers in Russia, tapirs in South America, and polar bears in the Canadian province of Nunavut. Jewell and Alibhai call their method footprint identification technique, or FIT. Professional trackers photograph footprints (with a ruler for scale) and add GPS coordinates. The footprints are then loaded into software that allows WildTrack to match them to a large number of known footprints from captive animals of the same species. Algorithms compare elements of the photographed footprint against those in a database of animals whose age and gender are known. Jewell and Alibhai got the idea for WildTrack while working with black rhinos in Zimbabwe in the late 1990s. It has taken years of tweaking and tinkering to develop algorithms that reliably recognize footprints of a given species. An ongoing challenge will be FIT\\'s reliability (it is currently 90 percent accurate at correctly determining the sex, age, and species). Nonetheless the technique is low cost, relatively easy to use, and noninvasive compared to radio collaring, which requires darting an animal. But FIT doesn\\'t work well with all animals yet, and is still very much in an experimental stage.  \"The zebra hoof is a big challenge because it\\'s hard to mark different shapes. On the other hand, a cheetah or lion footprint, where you have four toes and a heel pad, there\\'s lots of complexity there, making it easier to identify individuals,\" Jewell says.

       " ' Welcome to Throwback Tunesday, where Mashable amplifies the echoes of music past. With genre trends and throwbacks, we synthesize music and nostalgia. St. Lucia frontman Jean-Philip Grobler’s musical background is varied — and that\\'s putting it lightly. The South African-born musician grew up performing in a traveling, internationally performing boys choir. This group, the Drakensberg Boys Choir, is also a school nestled in an isolated mountain range, which Grobler attended for five years.  From there, Grobler went on to study music in Liverpool, eventually relocating to Brooklyn after landing a gig as a commercial musician. Through penning and mixing jingles, Grobler dipped into genres that he hadn\\'t previously explored. And it opened doors for him.  \"At the time I was obsessed with guitar bands, so I was like, Why would you ever want to use a synth? It was baffling to me as to why anybody would want that. But I learned to write with those instruments, and over time, from learning to use them I learned to love them. It became a part of my sound and my music,\" says Grobler. See also: Get Nostalgic With Ghost Beach\\'s \\'90s Playlist Today, Grobler brings the synth and his acquired taste for electropop to St. Lucia. Named not for the island, but for an African childhood vacation destination frequented by Grobler\\'s family, the music is packed with nostalgia beyond the synth tie-in. St. Lucia\\'s live lineup is rounded out by Patricia Beranek (Grobler\\'s wife — who he met during his Liverpool days), Ross Clark, Nick Paul and Dustin Kaufman. With a debut full-length album and several EPs under their belt in their ~2 years of existence, the group has been touring internationally and making waves. Mashable checked in with Grobler via Skype — who was in London touring at the time — starting with a (hilarious) photo from two years ago. What\\'s going on in the photo?  That was when we were playing in The Starlite Room in Santa Ana. There\\'s not a crazy backstory, but it was one of our first West Coast tours, and it was cool to be on the West Coast for the first time.  It\\'s not really a funny story per se, but the photo is with our old drummer Nick Brown, who left the band at the end of last year. It\\'s just a photo that we always look at and remember who he was and how foolish he could be (laughs).  You\\'ve said the band name comes from St. Lucia, a place you used to visit as a child. What are some of your favorite memories there?  I was born in South Africa and lived there until I was 19. St. Lucia was a place were we used to go on vacation, not every year, but we went there a couple of times. I remember the last time that I went there I was really small, and the only memory that I have is that my dad was going swimming or fishing one day — and I really, really wanted to go — but I was too young. I think it was a \"boys\" fishing trip. I was really, really sad … and I think I cried (laughs).  How do the \\'80s influence your music? The \\'80s definitely influence my music in a big way. I think the reason it\\'s so prominent, at least with the stuff we’ve released so far, is that leading up to the creation of St. Lucia, the music that I was making was very old rock based. Very strongly Radiohead-influenced, influenced by more guitar-based bands. Bands that also had some synth-y stuff.  But I also feel like at the end of the 2000s there was this music trend that was very dark and brooding and serious, and even though I really liked all of that music, I started feeling that making that felt a little bit tired. So I started listening back to some of my earlier influences in music, and this happened over a couple of years ... listening to it compared to the very serious guitar rock that I had been listening to before, you know, it just made me reconnect with a younger, more innocent part of myself, so that\\'s what you get today. You\\'ve said \"I really believe in albums, even though some people believe the year of the album has passed.\" Can you elaborate?  Radiohead\\'s OK Computer was one of the first albums where it really hit me — that this is such an amazing piece of work and I remember the first time I listened to that. It was actually my parents who bought that album for me from Christmas. It was a recommendation from random guy in a shopping mall who they asked what they should give me for Christmas. When I first heard it, I hated it. It sounded like noise to my ears. But it was Christmas weekend and all the shops were closed so I was kind of forced to live with this album. So I listened to it a few times and the third or fourth time, there were little things in it where I was like, Wow, pretty. Over time, it just started opening up to me and becoming really beautiful. It became one of my favorite record of all time.  I think because of that, but also if you have a really strong album versus a really strong single song, it\\'s similar to comparing a short story to a novel. A short story can be really interesting and enriching and powerful, but a novel just contains so much more information and richness and depth. That\\'s what I strive for in my music. I want to create something that’s like a longform statement. Do you find that your experience with the Drakensberg Boys Choir plays into your music today? Yes, absolutely. We did a lot of classical music in that boys choir. We did some cheesy contemporary pop classics like \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Celine Dion. We did a whole African music set and I guess the discipline of being in that choir — a very disciplined environment and we\\'d go on tours — I think having done that made it easier to do what we\\'ve done today. Just being on the road all the time, being uprooted from our homes all the time as well. But I also think musically it had an influence — all the interweaving choral harmonies and melodies, and I think that’s evident in some of what I do.  What about your experience writing commercial music?  I think I learned more about that than I did actually going to music school. I was thrust into this environment and at the time I really experienced at all with recording and mixing and I had to learn on the job. We were forced to write in so many different genres and styles. There were genres I didn\\'t have any experience in writing, like R&B or hip hop or electro. If you could go back to the beginnings of the band, about two years ago, and tell yourself one thing from where you sit now, what would it be? I would say, if you have a bad feeling about something or someone, trust your bad feeling and go the other way.   ',\n",

       " ' Good news ahead for tech and science innovators: American\\'s are overwhelmingly optimistic about future tech, according to a new study. Conducted by Pew Research and Smithsonian Magazine, the study polled 1,001 adults between Feb. 13 and 18 via phone.   See also: I, for One, Welcome Our New Robot Underlings Asking respondents a wide range of questions that covered everything from edge technology to far-out science-fiction scenarios, the study revealed a surprisingly upbeat view future tech — despite the many movies and books depicting dark technological dystopias.  However, it also revealed several counterintuitive takes on developing technologies that point to the need for more research into how some of them will be deployed commercially.  Driverless cars When asked about the prospect of driverless cars, 48% of respondents were interested in the invention, while 50% said they had no interest. Image:  Image courtesy of Bill Gross  Despite the nearly evenly divided opinion on the topic, however, 48% likely represents enough interest from the public to bolster the efforts of major automakers (and Google) currently working on the technology.  Wearable tech and implants Another surprising finding is that wearable tech isn\\'t as much of a mass-market slam dunk as some might think: 53% of the survey\\'s respondents said we\\'d be worse off in a future in which “most people wear implants or other devices that constantly show them information about the world around them.” Compare that to just 37% of respondents who said such a future would be a positive development.  Image:  Mashable Of course, because the commercial development of wearable tech is at such an early stage, most respondents are only imagining what kinds of devices might be available in the future; so, fear of the unknown could be playing a part in this category. Still, the largely apprehensive response is worth noting, particularly in light of recent negative public reactions to Google Glass.  Drones While the Federal Aviation Administration is currently working on a legal framework to accommodate commercial ventures such as Amazon Prime Air, which would rely on drones, the study found the public less than enthusiastic about this prospect.  Video: YouTube, Amazon  63% of the respondents said that if “personal and commercial drones are given permission to fly through most U.S. airspace,” it would be a change for the worse. The FAA has promised to have new guidelines in place for commercial drones by 2015, so we\\'ll know soon just how accurate this particular piece of research is on a major scale.  Humanoid robots One of the most frequent assumptions made by science-fiction movies depicting a reality in which humanoid robots are the norm is that humanity would welcome these tireless, wageless workers. But the study didn\\'t find that to be the case, with 65% of respondents indicating that such a reality would be a change for the worse.  Image:  MASHABLE,  CHRISTINA ASCANI But this could be a cultural quirk unique to the U.S. In Japan, where the population is rapidly dwindling and the government is ramping up efforts to encourage the development of humanoid caregivers for the elderly, such robots will likely be far more welcome, particularly considering the country\\'s long love affair with robots in fiction and in reality.  The singularity While the study doesn\\'t specifically mention the singularity, it does touch upon one area that will likely coincide with so-called sentient robots. Asked whether \"computers will soon match humans when it comes to creating music, novels, paintings, or other important works of art,\" 50% of respondents said it might be possible within the next 50 years, versus 45% who said it would not be possible in the same timespan.   However, even the study\\'s predicted 50-year timespan would be considered conservative by the likes of Ray Kurzweil, an inventor currently working for Google, who has an amazing track record for accurate technological predictions. Kurzweil puts the year of the singularity at 2045, just 31 years from now.  Objects in the mirror, closer than they appear No matter how you look at the study, it seems that Americans aren\\'t convinced that technology will change radically within the next few decades.  But this conservative view isn\\'t really consistent with the last 30 years of technology development — see the Internet, the iPhone, 3D printing, etc.  So it could be that Americans are mostly optimistic about future tech because they simply don\\'t realize how rapidly things can and will change.

       " ' The ice storm underway in the South is going to be one of the most damaging storms of its kind in decades, if current projections pan out. The storm, which is gathering strength along the Gulf Coast, is pushing warm, moist air up and over an entrenched cold dome of high pressure that is keeping temperatures below freezing at the surface from Maine to Alabama. Ice more than an inch thick is expected to coat much of central and eastern Georgia into central South Carolina.\\xa0This may not sound like much, but considering that tree branches will break at just a quarter to a half-inch of ice accumulation, entire trees and power poles are likely to come crashing down in the hardest-hit areas. See also: How to Track the Historic Ice Storm Freezing rain results when a layer of warm air aloft and cold air at the surface causes rain to fall and freeze upon contact with the ground. Today, a strong area of high pressure across New England has been funneling cold air all the way down the East Coast and into Georgia, in a phenomenon that weather forecasters call “cold air damming.” The cold air damming was so strong this morning that the 32 degree Fahrenheit line was advancing southwest across Georgia, as the cold, dense air oozed its way down the eastern seaboard. Want Proof It\\'s Serious? Hurricane Hunters Flew Into the Storm In an ominous sign, meteorologists at the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Atlanta have run out of adjectives to describe this event, writing in an early morning forecast discussion: “This is an event of historical proportions!! Catastrophic...Crippling… Paralyzing… Choose your adjective. This is a very very big deal especially from metro Atlanta east along the I-20 corridor… generally anywhere south of I-85 and north of I-16 where the most significant ice totals are forecast. Stay safe out there!” In order to improve the reliability of the computer models that its forecasters use to predict the weather, the NWS tasked the famed U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters to fly a reconnaissance mission above the Gulf of Mexico last night. The aircraft dropped instrument packages known as dropsondes, which sent back data on air temperature, pressure, and winds, among other information. This data was then fed into an overnight run of one of the main computer models, known as the North American Model (or NAM for short). “The U.S. Air Force Hurricane Hunter made five different drops in the Gulf of Mexico last evening,” NWS spokesman Chris Vaccaro told Mashable. “The purpose was to collect additional observations over the Gulf to better assist with [the] track and intensity [forecast] of the winter storm.” Such a flight is not standard operating procedure for most storms — but this thing is pretty serious.  The move also demonstrates the lack of consensus among the main computer models going into Wednesday morning, as the event was getting underway.  “I do not recall when the last time was that we used these types of aircraft observations for an East Coast storm, but we have in past for potential high impact events,” Vaccaro said in an email message. Previously, the NWS has gone to great lengths in order to improve the accuracy of computer models in advance of a highly selective number of major storm. In 2012, for example, it ordered extra weather balloon launches at 120 weather offices across the entire U.S. in order to provide a data boost that could improve forecast accuracy for Hurricane Sandy.  USAF Hurricane Hunters flying winter storm recon mission over Gulf of Mexico 2nite obtaining vital atmospheric data. http://t.co/uXkGGcSAiL — NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) February 12, 2014  After the flight and the computer model data that came in early on Wednesday, the NWS forecast office in Atlanta increased its forecast ice totals from about an inch to more than an inch. It\\'s All About the Ice Forecasts call for an inch or more of ice accumulation in an arc from southeast of Atlanta to Columbia, S.C., and on up to Raleigh, N.C. Such a large accumulation of ice is almost certain to cause extensive damage to trees and power lines because of the weight of the ice.  Based on an experimental index of ice storm severity, known as the Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, it will likely rank at a level 4 out of 5 in parts of South Carolina, meaning that the state could see “prolonged and widespread utility interruptions” that last at least five to 10 days.  Already, the freezing rain has resulted in at least 200,000 people losing power across the South and Southeast, a number that is expected to climb rapidly throughout the day on Wednesday and into Wednesday night. A less severe and widespread ice storm in the Southeast in 2000 caused more than 500,000 to lose power in Georgia alone. In addition, the tree damage from this event could be so significant that it is visible for many years, much as a 1998 ice storm caused widespread tree damage and blackouts across northern New England and Quebec. The weight of the ice causes tree limbs to snap off, and can even cause entire trees to topple. The ice is not the only threat from this storm. Heavy snow will also fall to the north of the zone of freezing rain, where the cold air layer is deeper. The storm is projected to move northeastward along the East Coast, blasting Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston with several inches of snow followed by a sloppy mess of rain and sleet (which is quite possibly the worst type of precipitation because it painfully hits you in the face). To the west of the big cities, across the Appalachians, more than a foot of snow may fall. Data indicates that there is the potential for two rare phenomena - thundersnow and thunder freezing rain, as vigorous atmospheric lift leads to the formation of thunderstorms on top of cold low-level air masses. If the track of the storm changes by as little as 30 miles, the zone of heaviest snow will shift. This could make the difference between a foot of snow in Washington and just six inches, which is the current forecast.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' To the college graduation class of 2009 and other alums that graduated soon after, here\\'s a hardy congratulations —  you officially no longer fall under the \"recent grad\" category of employee. In fact, you have now joined the ranks of the “experienced” worker.   As the dog days of summer approach, you\\'re not getting ready for another year of college, but for another level of advancement in your career. For most junior hires — particularly those that graduated during the recession — the first job straight out of school is rarely the \"dream job\" for which you\\'re ultimately striving. If you\\'re thinking ahead to what the future holds, now is the time to think — and act — differently than you did during your first job search after graduation. See also: Unlocking the Millennial Mystery: Career Motivations and Challenges Below are four helpful tips for moving on from your first post-grad opportunity, and onto bigger and better things. You now have some experience –- act like it Your first job may have come through your college career center or a career fair hosted by your university, via on-campus recruiting. You have now moved up in the world and understand that, while college may have been a good foundation, your work experience is additional experience to build upon. While (most of) you can\\'t expect to become the chief executive of a Fortune 500 company two years after graduation, you can — and should — be confident enough to begin taking on some additional responsibilities in your career path. Many companies are wary of hires straight out of school; you are not one of these employees anymore, so be sure that your work ethic, mentality and attitude reflects it. Think of your combined work experience and college degree as your \"pedigree.\" One definition of pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive. Taking this definition to your career history, consider what it is about you, your education and (now) your work experience that not only adds up to, but also multiplies your ability to exceed expectations in your next job. A note of caution on pedigree: Having it isn\\'t enough. Make sure you understand and can articulate why your pedigree makes you the best candidate for the role.  For example, instead of simply indicating, “I started my career at X Company,” be more specific: “I started my career at X Company, where I learned how to ABC, which is why I will be able to accomplish XYZ at your firm.” Check those social profiles Re-check your social profiles and make sure they do not scream, \"I am in college!\"; instead, they should scream, \"I am a young professional.\" Your LinkedIn profile needs to be complete, and in addition to following your university and college-related groups, follow companies that align with your interests and goals. Posting things about your alma mater isn\\'t a bad thing — but it shouldn\\'t be all that a prospective employer sees when they visit your page. Join professional groups, and join some conversations. Reconnect with alumni Your alumni network is still very valuable, so be sure to join the alumni groups in various social networks and in whatever area you land after graduation. LinkedIn offers a variety of alumni groups, as do a number of other social networks.  Don\\'t confine your networking exclusively to virtual opportunities — your university may have an active alumni network in your city, and you can check for Meetups as well. Attitude counts As with your freshman year of college experience, your \"sophomore year\" (and/or second or third job after college) is leaps and bounds beyond your first year of professional experience. While you still may require seasoning in order to take over as the top of the food chain, you\\'ve already gotten the lay of the land, and should have developed a better feel for your interests and long-term goals. This knowledge should be conveyed to potential employers and recruiters with confidence (not to be confused with arrogance) about your abilities to adjust to a new job and new professional opportunity. A note about experience: You may not know you have experience in something until you are called upon to use it. The factors that led you to get your first job may still be strong assets for your next role. Are you good at interviewing?  Do you have unique experience traveling abroad?  Are you skilled at networking? These useful skills still lay the groundwork for your future success — but building upon the lessons you\\'ve learned from your first job and other professional experiences add layers to the foundation of your long-term path.

       " ' FCC chairman Tom Wheeler really, really wants you to believe him. As the FCC prepares to rewrite regulations that will have a major impact on net neutrality, Wheeler has been on the warpath, seeking to allay fears that his proposed rules would open a Pandora\\'s box and ruin the openness of the Internet. See also: 10 Innovations That Improved the World in 2013 In a speech at The Cable Show, a cable industry event in Los Angeles, Wheeler struck a defiant tone. \"Put away the party hats,\" he said, directing his comments at groups that opposed net neutrality, including broadband providers. \"Let me be clear. If someone acts to divide the Internet between \\'haves\\' and \\'have nots,\\' we will use every power at our disposal to stop it,\" Wheeler said. Concerns about the separation of haves and have nots began when reports emerged that the FCC planned to circulate new Open Internet rules to address a 2010 court decision that partially struck down the existing regulations. Wheeler\\'s proposal includes a provision that would allow \"commercially reasonable\" deals between content providers and the companies that control the pipes of the Internet. The \"commercially reasonable\" phrase sparked concern among Internet watchdogs, who feared it would allow powerful companies to form preferential arrangements, leaving startups and innovators at a disadvantage. Wheeler said that concern about the \"commercially reasonable\" clause \"misses the point that any new rule will assure an open pathway that is sufficiently robust to enable consumers to access the content, services and applications they demand and innovators and edge providers the ability to offer new products and services.\" Wheeler\\'s comments follow a blog post he wrote Tuesday, his second in a week, in which he sought to address critics who said that the new rules would allow companies to co-opt the openness of the Internet. He also justified the FCC\\'s actions, pointing to the need for regulation that the commission could enforce quickly and legally. \"I am concerned that acting in a manner that ignores the ... court’s guidance, or opening an entirely new approach, invites delay that could tack on multiple more years before there are Open Internet rules in place,\" Wheeler wrote.

       " ' It’s easier than ever to share what you’re listening to on Pandora with your Facebook friends, thanks to an extended partnership between the two companies.  Starting Wednesday, the songs and stations you listen to, as well as the tracks you give a \"thumbs up,\" can be shared directly to Facebook.  Details about your activity on Pandora, when shared via the social network, is then aggregated and displayed as part of the music section on your Facebook profile. Pandora already supported sharing individual pieces of content to Facebook and Twitter. The new integration is the product of a year-and-a-half-long conversation between Facebook and Pandora. “We’ve been talking to Facebook about how best to embrace this idea of what they call Timeline Apps — \\'How do you make it really, really easy for people to update their Facebook identity as they consume content around the Internet and on mobile?\\'” Tom Conrad, Pandora\\'s chief technology officer, told Mashable. “Our frame in the conversation with them has always been, ‘How do we embrace this technical opportunity in a way that drives real value for both Pandora listeners and for Facebook users?”   SEE ALSO: 7 Tips and Tricks for Pandora Pros Facebook’s recent Timeline update, as well as its music section, compelled Pandora to pursue deeper integration, Conrad added. Users are now able to seamlessly stream all their activity on Pandora to Facebook through an opt-in program. They can choose to send all data about their Pandora activity, or just a bit of their musical history (e.g. songs you give a \"thumbs up\"), to the social network.  Shared activity will appear in the Activity Log and the Music section of users\\' Facebook profiles, as well as on their friends\\' News Feeds based on Facebook’s algorithm.   “Seeing an ever-updating ticker of what my friends are listening to — what all of my friends are listening to — is less interesting than coming to understand the musical identity of a subset of the people that I interact with on Facebook,” Conrad explained. Facebook\\'s News Feed algorithm focuses on friends that users regularly interact with. That functionality extends to Pandora’s Facebook integration as well, so they won\\'t suddenly have a News Feed filled with Pandora posts from all their high-school friends. In essence, it\\'s a Facebook-curated feed that is limited only to people that a user is interested in hearing about. When sharing isn\\'t desired, a prominent toggle button within Pandora allows incognitio listening. This may be enforced, for example, when a user is listening to a holiday-themed radio station, but doesn\\'t want to broadcast those details to their friends.  Intended to enhance the Pandora experience rather than invade privacy, Conrad said the service will be reaching out and educating its users about the new feature, explaining how to opt in, and how to control what data (if any) gets sent to Facebook. Pandora’s new Facebook integration is live now.  What Pandora activity will you share on Facebook? Let us know in the comments.

       " ' In case of an imminent threat, President Obama is authorized to order a pre-emptive strike using cyberweapons against the enemy, according to a secret legal review of U.S. cyberwar policies revealed by the New York Times on Monday.  The Obama administration has been drafting rules controlling the use of malware, and the rules of engagement in cyberwarfare. Some of these policies have been revealed by administration officials who spoke to Times on condition of anonymity because the rules are supposed to be highly classified.  Despite warnings by experts, including Obama\\'s former cybersecurity czar Howard Schmidt, it appears the administration is ready to grant broad powers to the President to attack an enemy even when there\\'s no declared war, but simply an imminent danger.  Allowing the President to order a pre-emptive cyberstrike when there hasn\\'t been a declaration of war is bound to create controversy. \"It is unclear how you would ever convince others that the attack was justified,\" Adam Segal, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an email to Mashable. \"What proof could you offer that another country was preparing a digital attack? And how would we react if another country did the same? Without some agreed norms of how states can use these weapons and what targets are legitimate, we end up with a great deal of uncertainty and competition.\" To Segal, those \"agreed norms\" shouldn\\'t come in the form of international treaties, but rather \"diplomatic talks and confidence-building measures like greater transparency about doctrine,\" he said.   But having secret policies can have its advantages too. Allan Friedman, a cybersecurity expert and fellow at the Brookings Institution, thinks that cyberwarfare is a field that \"is not mature enough to expect anyone to have very clear lines, very clear public laws, and standards defining their use,\" he said in a phone interview with Mashable. \"We simply don\\'t know enough about the technology to develop that. So any policy is going to have a certain lack of transparency.\" Also, for Friedman, secret policies allow for greater flexibility. \"I think that allows at least a responsible administration to treat each incident as separate and unique,” he said.  At the same time, Friedman thinks that having the power to strike pre-emptively and taking on the role of an international peace-maker is a huge responsibility that can\\'t be taken lightly. \"If we want to have the dominant offensive capacity as a way of trying to deter other people from being overly active in that space, then we can\\'t use it ourselves, or we have to be very circumspect about using it ourselves,\" he said.  SEE ALSO: Cybersecurity Guru Calls for More Online Regulation  Officially, there is no record of any cyberattack between nations, although speculation has run rampant in the last few months. The United States is believed to be behind the Stuxnet virus that hit Iranian nuclear facilities, spinning their centrifuges out of control. This is believed to be the first cyberattack to prove that digital weapons can have an effect on real-life infrastructure, causing real damage.  According to the anonymous officials, cyberweapons are even more powerful than previously thought. \"There are levels of cyberwarfare that are far more aggressive than anything that has been used or recommended to be done,\" one official told the Times. Other attacks, allegedly carried out by nation-sponsored hackers, have been reported.  Last week, the New York Times itself revealed it had been the target of an attack — allegedly from Chinese hackers. And rumors indicated that the White House considered retaliation, with senior officials launching stern warnings to the regime. \"We have to begin making it clear to the Chinese that the United States is going to have to take action to protect not only our government\\'s, but our private sector, from this kind of illegal intrusions,\" said outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday. In January, the Russian online security firm Kaspersky Lab releaved a 5-year cyberespionage operation codenamed Red October. Its authors are unknown, but experts have speculated that either Russia or China could have been behind it. And in June of last year, Kaspersky also uncovered Flame, another cyber operation that might have been orchestrated by the United States and Israel.  For Friedman, there\\'s no doubt that this is an international issue, not only limited to the United States. \"We are in a cyber arms race already,\" he said.

The Jamaica Olympic Association said on Monday that it would cover the group\\'s travel costs, while a series of online fundraisers have put together the money for other elements like equipment and further training. Crowdfunding, doge, Reddit and virtual currency have combined to raise approximately $93,000 in less than three days (at the time of writing) for the Olympics-bound underdogs. See also: 14 Ways \\'Cool Runnings\\' Is Still Relevant to Your Life The Jamaican bobsled team, which was immortalized in the 1993 Disney movie Cool Runnings, qualified for Sochi after a 12-year absence from the games. However, as recently as two days ago, the team was broke and needed $80,000 to compete. The team has no official funding and will need to pay for various costs including travel and equipment. The Internet took notice, and money began to roll in. Two crowdfunding platforms, Indiegogo and Crowdtilt, have raised $23,111 and $40,698, respectively. The Indiegogo page was officially set up by Team Jamaica, however Crowdtilt has also verified its campaign. The bulk of donations thus far have come through efforts coordinated on Reddit.  In a post entitled \"Let\\'s send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Winter Olympics!\" on the dogecoin subreddit, Redditors were encouraged to donate to the Jamaican team in the form of dogecoins. Dogecoin is a virtual currency, similar to Bitcoin, based on the Doge meme. Dogecoins are not nearly as valuable as Bitcoin, but recently became the most traded virtual currency. While dogecoins are still quite cheap — about 1 dogecoin trades for $0.0009547 — the group was able to amass about $30,000. The dogecoins were converted into bitcoins, then exchanged for dollars, according to an update on the post.  The team officially qualified for the event on Saturday.

       " ' Fashion Week is about coordinating show invites, seating charts, photos, and editorial samples — a process that got a lot easier this year thanks to an iOS app called GPS Radar. While its couture may be on the cutting edge, Fashion Week\\'s tech has been slipping for some time. Often progressive as far as the arts and design, administratively the industry tends to be a bit on the messy side. Fashion GPS steps in and takes a lot of the headache out of organizing events, streamlining the process for sending out the invites and dishing editorial samples. It is already used by a number of top names such as Marc Jacobs and Donna Karan, and its growing fast. The app is currently used by over 12 thousand of the top designers, editors and influencers in the industry, and has earned itself a spot fashion events around the world.  Fashion Organized   About Fashion GPS Services from FashionGPS on Vimeo. With GPS Radar designers can send out invitations to shows, and see in real-time who has responded to them. The day of the event, that same RSVP list can be pulled up on an iPad to check people in. As people respond, designers can use the guest list to create a seating chart for the big day. The seating chart can be controlled and changed in real time, so if someone doesn’t show up –- or a VIP does -– assignments can be adjusted on the fly accordingly. Fashion show attendees can use another app called Fashion Radar to keep track of all of their event invitations, get directions to the show, and access a virtual ticket to bypass the line to check in when they get there. A Picture’s Worth a Thousand Words  One hour after each show, Radar users are given access to photos from that show. The company says that one hour time frame is crucial for the company and the insiders using the app. It recently started working with a company called NOWFASHION to make the quick turn around a reality. Editors can write notes on particular pieces to remember later, and share pictures on Instagram, Twitter, or Tumblr from directly within the app. Meant to be used as editorial images, bloggers can also pull the images to be used in posts about a particular line. Once the show is over, brands can keep track of the social buzz surrounding their line, tracking what photos are most saved as well as what’s popular on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. A site called GPS Styles lets fashion brands who might not even have a fashion show uploaded photos, offering the same functionality for editors and influencers. Samples Simplified  Pictures in each gallery also have a “Request Sample” button, allowing editors to request a sample of a particular item to be included in an upcoming shoot or event. Tapping the button adds the item to a separate folder of items you’d like to request. Once you’ve collected everything you might need, all of your requests can be sent out with a single tap. Requests can be made just hours after the show ends. Something that previously required taking notes, and requesting look books — a process that could take days or weeks rather than hours. On the designer’s end, each item of clothing they have has its own unique barcode. Designers can scan a particular piece using a separate app called GPS Samples, and send it out almost instantaneously. They can also easily track where that item is, and when it will be returned right from their iPad. Why iOS? Fashion GPS is especially passionate about using Apple products with its software,  both for their stability and fashion-forward look. \"Over the years we have worked with different technologies but we enjoy working with Apple. With something as important and as tightly timed as a fashion show, nothing can go down so we trust them.”  Eddie Mullon, CEO & founder of Fashion GPS told Mashable. “Their products are intuitive and robust. We’ve led the charge in the fashion industry’s embrace of the iPad and its capacity to aid in visually telling a story. It’s sort of like a slick, digital clipboard.”  GPS Radar wasn’t the only iOS app hitting the runway during New York’s Fashion Week. Twitter’s Vine made its Fashion Week debut during this year’s event; with many show goers creating short videos from their front row seats. Several designers also caught using drawing app Paper to sketch out ideas from the runway.  What do you think about technology\\'s new role on the runway? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

Right now, the Sense+ prototype can only dock and charge an iPhone 5 via lightning connection. But the creators — product designers Will Grant and Michael Charles — say future versions for Android and Windows phones are planned. The dock is powered multiple ways: by plugging it into main power, from the docked iPhone or from a built-in backup battery. Grant and Charles are trying to raise $150,000 on Indiegogo to further develop Sense+. With 43 days still left to go in the campaign, supporters had pledged about $900, as of Tuesday afternoon. Supporters can get early-bird specials on the dock for $79, with expected delivery in November. It\\'s important to note that the design is not foolproof and is not a substitute for traditional smoke alarms. SensePlus clearly warns: \"Ceiling mounted smoke alarms are still recognized as the preferred response alarm. As such the Sense+ is intended as an additional safety system for fixed in home ceiling mounted smoke alarms.\" Additionally, gadgets can sometimes be the culprits themselves, leading to further reason to ensure smoke alarms are up to date: In 2012, a Colorado woman said her iPhone 4, plugged into an Apple charger, burst into flames on the nightstand, while she was sleeping at a hotel. However, this may simply have been an isolated incident. Note: If your home\\'s smoke alarms were installed more than 10 years ago (before July 2, 2003), the U.S. Fire Administration recommends replacing them.

       " ' The people of Catalan who wish to secede from Spain are filled with pride, fervor and a great deal of physical strength. Every other year in October, teams from across Spain assemble in Tarragona, a city nearly 50 miles southwest of Barcelona, and compete to build the tallest and most intricate tower of people, also known as castells. The Human Tower Competition celebrated its 25th anniversary on Sunday. See also: 15 #SelfieOlympics Shots Worthy of a Gold Medal Teams consist of 75 to 100 men, women and children, and each team gets five chances to construct a tower. Scoring is based on points earned from the three best towers. A tower only is only considered successful if no one falls during its creation; as a tower is built, whoever stands at the top is required to extend four fingers on one hand to symbolize the Catalan flag. More than 40 teams competed, but only one — the Castellers de Vilafranca — came out on top.

       " ' American Top 40 radio legend Casey Kasem, who had Parkinson\\'s disease and dementia, died Sunday on Father\\'s Day surrounded by relatives and close friends at 3:23 a.m. PT at St. Anthony\\'s Hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, Mashable has confirmed. Kasem was 82.  \"Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken,\" Kerri Kasem, his daughter from his first marriage with Linda Myers, wrote on Facebook. \"Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad.\" See also: \\'Brady Bunch\\' Star Ann B. Davis Dies at 88 After Fall in Home  Post by Kerri Kasem. His children took Kasem off life support in a Washington hospice this week. Kerri Kasem explained the decision in a statement that included a message from her dad:  The court\\'s decision today upheld our father’s explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive: \"If the extension of my life would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning, then I do not desire any form of life sustaining procedures, including nutrition and hydration ...\"  Transitioning our father\\'s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we\\'ve ever had to make. For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia. We continue to hope that Jean and Liberty will come join his family during this time.  Jean Kasem, Casey\\'s second and final wife, wanted to keep him alive, and was embroiled in a legal battle with his three children from his previous marriage. A judge eventually allowed the children to grant Kasem\\'s wishes, withholding food and liquids to end his suffering.  Casey Kasem hosted the popular music countdown American Top 40, which he founded, from 1970 to 1988 and then again from 1998 to 2004. He left radio altogether in 2009, ending the subsequent shows American Top 20 and American Top 10 with his retirement.   Ryan Seacrest and Casey Kasem talk in 2005 at CBS Studios Stage 46. Radio host Ryan Seacrest, who took over AT40 in 2004, expressed his condolences Sunday.   \"It’s a sad day for the broadcasting community and for radio listeners around the world,\" Seacrest said. \"When I was a kid, I would listen to Casey Kasem’s AT40 show every weekend, and dream about someday becoming a radio DJ.  ... Casey had a distinctive friendly on-air voice, and he was just as affable and nice if you had the privilege to be in his company. He’ll be greatly missed by all of us.\" Kasem\\'s AT40 sign-off was \"Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.\"  Kasem, born Kemal Amin Kasem in Detroit, also did voiceover work (most notably as Shaggy in Scooby-Doo). But it was his radio stints that made him a household name.  \"RIP Casey Kasem\" immediately became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter:   The original voice of Shaggy on #ScoobyDoo, & countless other cartoon characters, has passed.

       " '  \"Don\\'t use your phone while it\\'s charging,\" \"don\\'t leave it plugged in overnight\" and \"always let it die completely\" — these are just a few popular myths about smartphone batteries. When it comes to battery life, there are many little rules for what you can and can\\'t do with your smartphone. While plenty of real rules exist, there are several rumored ones you can simply ignore. Phone batteries have evolved so much over the years, becoming smarter and easier to manage. Most lithium-ion batteries, used by major retailers like Samsung and Apple, should last between three and five years, if you take proper care of it.  See also: 7 Ways You\\'re Killing Your Tech Here\\'s the truth behind five major phone charging myths.  Image:  MashableMyth 1: Using off-brand chargers destroys batteries. The truth: Off-brand chargers, while not optimal, are fine. It\\'s knockoffs you should avoid. Don\\'t go for cheap brand knockoff chargers when you can at least purchase inexpensive, off-brand chargers (as long as they\\'re made by legitimate retailers, such as Belkin and KMS). The folks at Lifehacker ran a detailed experiment in which they pitted official chargers against knockoffs and off-brand models. The results showed that off-brand chargers, though obviously not as good as the official thing, work just fine. Knockoffs barely even get the job done.  Myth 2: You shouldn\\'t use your phone while it charges. The truth: Use it all you want, as long as you\\'re not using a sketchy third-party charger.  There are scary reasons behind this myth. People believe that using a phone while charging will make the phone explode, or electrocute the user. That actually happened to a Chinese flight attendant named Ma Ailun in July 2013, when she used her iPhone 4 while it was charging. However, reports say it\\'s because Ailun was using a third-party charger, not an original Apple charger.  If you\\'re using the manufacturer-approved charger and battery, you should be fine.  Myth 3: Charging your phone overnight kills the battery. The truth: Your phone is smarter than you think. Once it\\'s fully juiced up, it knows to stop charging. That means the battery isn\\'t even in use at all.  However, that doesn\\'t mean you should be charging your phone all night, every night. You wouldn\\'t fill a cup with water if it was already full, would you? Your battery life will last longer if you keep your phone charged between 40% and 80%.  Myth 4: You don\\'t need to turn your phone off — ever. The truth: Your phone may be a machine, but it still needs to take a few breaks. An Apple Genius said that in order to maximize battery life, you should turn off your phone from time to time, especially when you go to bed at night. At the very least, Apple experts recommend turning your phone off once a week in order to preserve battery life.  Turning off your phone is important for Android devices as well. A simple reboot can help restore battery life.  Myth 5: Don\\'t charge your phone until it\\'s completely dead. The truth: It\\'s better to charge your phone every day than to do a \"deep charge\" from time to time. Lithium-ion batteries, like the kind used in Samsung and Apple products fare better when they\\'re charged. If you constantly let them drain to 0%, they become unstable. Your battery has a finite number of charge cycles, and every time it fully dies, that\\'s another cycle out the window.  BONUS: Fact — heat will ruin a battery. The truth: This is absolutely true. Heat and tech don\\'t generally go hand-in-hand, and that\\'s no different with phone batteries.  Lithium-ion batteries heat themselves, and get hotter while they\\'re being charged. Cold weather can also have a negative impact on a phone\\'s life, and a cold battery will die faster than usual in low temperatures. Your phone will be safe if you keep it within its recommended temperatures; Apple says 32 degrees Fahrenheit is the lowest recommended temperature for an iPhone\\'s environment. Samsung, on the other hand, guarantees its phones can function anywhere between -4 and 122 degrees.  Techquickie has a pretty neat video that explains some of these myths in detail.  ',\n",

       " ' A range of international organizations are ramping up their responses to help children who are increasingly affected by the Ebola outbreak in western Africa. Save the Children, an independent NGO that provides services to children around the world, is building two Ebola treatment centers and 10 community care units in the region, as part of an expanded effort to help children and families affected by the crisis. See also: Instagram Photos Show Front Lines of Liberia\\'s Ebola Crisis Unicef, the leading international children\\'s charity, also said it is conducting a number of lifesaving awareness campaigns in all three countries, providing \"mass quantities of medical supplies, tents, protective equipment, soap, chlorine, latex, gloves, masks and more,\" according to a spokesperson. The goal, Save the Children CEO Carolyn Miles told Mashable after a recent visit to the region, is simple: Stop transmission of the virus.  Carolyn Miles, the CEO for Save the Children in Unification Town, Liberia, on Oct. 3, 2014.Image: Jerome Delay/Associated Press“For every one person that gets Ebola, more than one other person is getting it,” she said. “That’s what you’ve gotta change.” The group recently released a YouTube video that states Ebola has reached a \"tipping point.\"   \"If we and the international community can\\'t step up our recent to halt the spread now, cases could run to hundreds of thousands in the future,\" the group\\'s Dan Stewart says in the clip. An estimated 7,470 people have been infected with Ebola in western Africa since the start of the most recent outbreak, resulting in 3,431 reported deaths, according to the World Health Organization’s latest assessment.  A WHO chart shows cases\\tof\\tEbola virus disease in\\tGuinea,\\tLiberia, and\\tSierra\\tLeone, as of Oct. 1, 2014.Image:  WHOMost of those who are dying are parents, creating a secondary crisis for their children. An estimated 3,700 have lost their parents to Ebola in the recent outbreak, according to Unicef. These are numbers that are believed to be widely underestimated.  The average family in Liberia, for instance, includes three children — meaning three kids that are affected for nearly each person that dies of the disease.

Their house was boarded up and everything inside was burned to kill any remnants of the virus, so the kdis had nowhere else to turn.  “Lots of kids there are shunned by their communities due to worry about infection,” Miles said, “even though these kids had gone more than 21 days since exposure.”  #Ebola making 1000\\'s of #kids orphans.

That’s an easier job when the kids are older; not so much when dealing with toddlers.  Post by Save the Children. “You mostly have to depend on the children,” Miles said. “One 18-year-old was able to give us lots of information about where her family was from, naming her aunts, uncles. But with little kids it is really tough because they usually don’t even know.”  In those cases, the charity is working with foster families who take the kids in; others wind up at independent care units. But the best thing is to get kids back to their extended family if possible, she said.  Zeinabou, 4, survived to #Ebola & will be soon reunified w/ her family tx 2 @UNICEF support.

We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far far more resources.” “There’s still time for people to support this response and do something to help people there,” Miles added. “Making donations to Save the Children or anyone else who is working on this can help. People is one limiting factor — and obviously money is the other,” she said.  \\u2028“We’ve got to reach more kids.” BONUS: What If Ebola Made It to New York City?        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#appId=116628718381794&xfbml=1&status=1&cookie=1\",\"facebook_jssdk\");_msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' Emails bombard our inboxes day in and day out, but can you remember the last time you received a handwritten letter?  Artist Ivan Cash wants to remind you how it feels to find a handwritten note waiting inside your mailbox. In the third installment of his collaborative project, \"Snail Mail My Email,\" Cash created a video asking people on the streets of San Francisco to compare emails with letters. For the folks in this clip, the consensus is clear: Handwritten ones always win. See also: Social Experiment Asks: What\\'s the Last Photo on Your Phone?  Cash created \"Snail Mail My Email\" in 2011 after quitting what he thought was his dream job at an advertising agency in Amsterdam. He told Mashable that though he loved writing letters, he didn\\'t have time for it with a full-time job.  \"Emails are great and all, but god there are so many of them, and they are so much less intimate and personal than receiving a letter in the mail,\" he said. Writing a letter, he added, \"is an act of true generosity that says, \\'I care about you and took the time to write this for you.\\'\" So Cash set out to write more letters through \"Snail Mail My Email.\" For 30 days, he and hundreds of volunteers turned strangers\\' submitted email messages into handwritten notes.  Cash and his team send your first letter, but it\\'s up to you to keep the handwritten correspondence going. The project was enormously successful, with Cash and his team sending more than 10,000 letters. The project even landed him a book deal comprised of photos from the monthlong event. Image: Ivan Cash Image: Ivan Cash Now, two years later, \"Snail Mail My Email\" has become an annual week-long event. In 2012, project volunteers from all over the world, including students at a grade school in the Czech Republic, sent more than 3,000 letters. This year, Cash said that over 200 people have signed up to write. \"What\\'s amazing about this project to me is the generosity of the volunteers through the years,\" Cash said, remarking on the time and resources from his collaborators. \"To me, it speaks to the essential value of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\" You can find more information on Cash\\'s work on his website.

Despite repeated warnings that he shouldn\\'t get too close to the outdoor enclosure, the man eventually climbed over a knee-high fence, through some small hedges, then jumped down 18 feet into a protective moat, said National Zoological Park spokesman Riyaz Ahmed Khan.

The man, whose body remained in the outdoor enclosure two hours after the attack, was dead by the time help reached him, Khan said. \"The tiger was just being a tiger,\" said Belinda Wright, who has spent years working to protect India\\'s dwindling numbers of wild tigers. \"An unusual object fell into his domain. ...

       " '     A video titled \"The Importance of Appearances,\" by YouTube user norniTube, proves that we all may be too quick to judge a book by its cover.  In a heartbreaking social experiment, a man dressed as a homeless person falls down in a busy street in Paris, France. Dozens of people pass by him, no one offering a hand. Then, a person dressed in a suit falls in the exact same location, appearing to be sick, and everyone jumps to his aid.  See also: The Internet Raised $44,000 So a Homeless Man Could Have a House The video claims the \"homeless\" man was lying on the street for more than five minutes without anyone offering help. Some of the passers-by stop to take a second look, but still do nothing.  On the other hand, the man in a suit doesn\\'t even need to cry for help before several people hurry to his side.  While the \"experiment\" can\\'t be 100% validated, it still shows an interesting, and unpleasant, side of human nature.  The video also highlights an incident from 2008, when a woman collapsed in a waiting room of a New York City hospital, and the staff ignored her for 45 minutes.  At one point in the video, a caption simply asks: \"What if it was you?\" A chilling thought considering any one of us could one day be on the wrong end of a snap judgement.

       " \" In the season finale of Twin Peaks, Laura Palmer told Agent Dale Cooper she'd see him again in 25 years, and now it seems she'll be making good on her promise.  Showtime announced Monday the return of David Lynch and Mark Frost's cult classic TV show Twin Peaks for a limited series of nine episodes.  See also: Why 'Twin Peaks' Isn't Just a TV Show — It's an Obsession So far, the show's creators are tight-lipped about who from the original cast will be back, but promise a mix of old and new faces.  Here's what the stars have been up to since the show went off their air in 1991.   'Twin Peaks': Where Are They Now?        Kyle MacLachlan (Special Agent Dale Cooper)  Kyle MacLachlan played Special Agent Dale Cooper, the FBI agent and cherry pie enthusiast who came to Twin Peaks to investigate the death of Laura Palmer.  Since then, MacLachlan’s kept busy with several supporting stints in shows like Desperate Housewives, Sex & the City, and How I Met Your Mother.  He can currently be seen as the bumbling mayor of Portland on Portlandia. A wine enthusiast, he recently teamed up with vinter Eric Dunham to create the label Pursued by Bear.  He also has a website devoted to his dogs Mookie and Sam.    Image:  Mashable Composite. Ryan Emberley/Associated Press         Sherilyn Fenn (Audrey Horne)  Twin Peaks’ resident bad girl Audrey Horne was played by Sherilyn Fenn.  She followed up Twin Peaks by starring in Diary of a Hitman opposite Forest Whitaker and Of Mice & Men with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich. In 1995, she returned to television starring as Elizabeth Taylor in the made-for-TV biopic Liz: The Elizabeth Taylor Story and from 1998-2001, she tackled the role of an alcoholic ex-soap opera star struggling to get sober in Showtime’s Rude Awakening.  Since then, she's mostly played bit parts on a variety of TV shows and even played two different characters on Gilmore Girls because the show’s creator was such a fan of her work.  From 2009-2013, she maintained a personal blog titled Postcards from the Ledge.     Image:  Mashable Composite.  GabboT/Flickr         Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer)  Sheryl Lee played Laura Palmer, the high school cheerleader whose murder (and double life) brought everyone's dirty secrets to light.  She reprised the role in Fire Walk With Me, a prequel that details the events leading up to her character’s death.  Lee was almost cast as Mary-Alice on Desperate Housewives, which would have been her second television role playing a character who was dead for the entire series, but the role ultimately went to Brenda Strong.  Other career highlights include starring in Oscar Wilde’s Salome on Broadway opposite Sylvester Stallone and a role in the Oscar-nominated film Winter’s Bone.  She is currently married to Neil Diamond’s son.   Image:  Mashable Composite. GabboT/Flickr         Donna Heyward (Lara Flynn Boyle)  Lara Flynn Boyle played Donna Heyward, Laura Palmer’s best friend who is determined to find her killer.  After Twin Peaks wrapped, she was too busy starring in the legal drama The Practice to reprise her role as Donna Heyward for Fire Walk With Me and was replaced by Moira Kelly. Some of her film roles include Wayne’s World, Men in Black II, and Happiness. After high-profile relationships with her Twin Peaks co-star Kyle MacLachlan, David Spade and Jack Nicholson she married a real estate investor in San Antonio, TX.

Ontkean currently lives in Hawaii, where he played a role in the Oscar-nominated film The Descendents.    Image:  Mashable Composite. Michael Ontkean         Leland Palmer (Ray Wise)   Ray Wise played Leland Palmer, Laura’s father who turns out to have sinister secrets of his own.  He played the devil in the 2007-2009 series Reaper and has had recurring roles on 24, Chuck, and Mad Men.  On film, he starred in horror movie Jeepers Creepers II and played CBS News anchor Don Hollenbeck in Good Night, And Good Luck.  In 2003, he starred in a trippy music video for indie rock band Beach House directed by comedian Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric Show, Great Job!, which Wise has appeared on.  He is currently starring in Farmed and Dangerous, an original web series created by Chipotle.  (Seriously.)   Image:  Mashable Composite. Ryan Miller/Associated Press         Peggy Lipton (Norma Jennings)  Peggy Lipton played Norma Jennings, a former beauty queen and the owner of Double R Diner (home of a damn fine cup of coffee.)   Lipton, who rose to fame in the 1970s on The Mod Squad, has had recurring roles on the television shows Popular and Crash since Twin Peaks ended.  She also had a part in the post-apocalyptic film The Postman.  Lipton was married to producer Quincy Jones and is the mother of actress Rashida Jones.     Image:  Mashable Composite. Chris Pizzello/Associated Press         Joan Chen (Josie Packard)  Joan Chen played Josie Packard, a widow who inherited the Packard Saw Mill and Sheriff Truman's love interest.  She has co-starred in numerous films since Twin Peaks including Oliver Stone's Heaven & Earth and Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.  In 1998, she made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed film Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl.  She has continued to act and direct.   Image:  Mashable Composite. Andrew Medichini/Associated Press         James Marshall (James Hurley)  James Marshall played James Hurley, Laura Palmer’s secret biker boyfriend from the wrong side of the tracks.   He has been in a few films since Twin Peaks wrapped, most notably, Gladiator.   In 2010, he sued pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-LaRoche, claiming that the drug Accutane caused gastrointestinal distress severe enough to require the removal of his colon.  Marshall won $11 million.  He is now a singer-songwriter.         \",\n",
       " ' One scientist has found a way to study 1,000 generations of animals in a matter of days — using no live creatures and a lot of robot sex. By using robots the size of rats,\\xa0Dr. Stefan Elfwing of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was able to study evolutionary patterns over thousands of generations without him growing old in the process. In an article published on April 9 in the journal PLOS ONE, Elfwing describes how this could provide a way for scientists to gather information about evolution much faster than before.  His study also proves that robots can be used to study animals. See also: Bionic Kangaroo Hops Into the Future of Robotics Elfwing programmed a colony of small, wheeled bots with the need to forage for batteries that he placed in the vicinity, as well as the need to \"mate.\" The robots would obviously produce no offspring, but the desire to mate allowed Elfwing to study how successful mating habits evolve. Each bot was equipped with a camera so it could locate mates. Sex between bots happened in a very PG way — a port that uses infrared light to copy their genes when they find a suitable partner. The robots used electrodes in their teeth to recharge once they found a battery.  The conclusion? Chasing after both sex and food is too exhausting. Mating and finding batteries both tired the robots out, according to the\\xa0study, and a successful \"reproduction\" depends on whether two robots have enough energy to, uh, consummate their relationship after their ports line up. This meant that robots had to figure out how to best spend their energy in order to survive and spread their genes. After 70 experiments, Elfwing found that 75% of the robots turned into what he called \"trackers,\" or robots that actively sought mating partners. The rest turned into \"foragers,\" or robots that sought batteries and only happened to mate if their infrared port lined up with another port during their quest for more electricity. The proportions of these two distinct mating habits are similar to patterns seen in the wild, meaning Elfwing\\'s robots seem to be a valid way to study animals. With that success, Elfwing hopes his robots will help him explore other facets of evolution. “In this experiment, our robots were hermaphrodites, all robots mate and can produce offspring,\" Elfwing said in the Okinawa institute\\'s article.  \"In the next stage, we want to see if the robots will take on male and female roles, by taking different risks and costs in reproduction. The behavior exhibited by the two strategies, \"forager\" and \"tracker,\" may be a precursor to the adoption of distinct genders.” ',\n",

       " ' Nokia started as a paper company. It was 1865, and the mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a wood pulp mill next to the Tammerkoski Rapids in the southwest of Finland. A few years later, he opened a second mill, this one located on the banks of the Nokianvirta River — a river, apparently, named for an animal: a small mammal related to the weasel and the wolverine. But the company that derived its name from a weasel-y creature wouldn\\'t be a one-product outfit for long. It would soon acquire a rubber factory and a telephone-and-telegraph-cable manufacturer. It would dabble in electronics and clothing and forestry and robotics.  Now, with the news that Nokia will sell its handset business — and its patents along with it — to Microsoft, it\\'s worth remembering the many, many other times that Nokia has shifted course during its 150-year history. Nokia has been pivoting since before pivoting was a thing. Like Toyota, like Honda, like Apple, it has adjusted to the times — to the extent that a review of Nokia products reads like a review of the history of recent technology.  Nokia, to be sure, may have adjusted more slowly than it should have when it came to the smartphone revolution; but Tuesday\\'s announcement marks yet another big shift for a company that, for most of its history, has embraced shifting as a way of life. \"Changing with the times, disrupting the status quo – it’s what we’ve always done,\" the company\\'s history declares. And while it\\'s questionable, here, where the line lies between disrupting and being disrupted, it\\'s clear that \"changing with the times\" is indeed part of the company\\'s DNA.  With that in mind, below is a brief history of Nokia as seen through its varied products:  Paper Rubber Telephone cables Telegraph cables Electrical cables Car tires Bicycle tires Footwear (including galoshes) Forestry tools Electricity generation machinery Military communications equipment (such as the SANLA M/90 device) Gas masks (such as the M61 gas mask for the Finnish Army) Televisions Consumer electronics in general Personal computers Capacitors Plastics Aluminum Chemicals Robotics  Image: Flickr, John Karakatsanis    This article originally published at The Atlantic here  ',\n",

       " ' Over the last few years, doctors have called sitting \"the new smoking.\" Studies have identified excessive sitting as a risk factor for obesity, cancer, and heart disease. And an\\xa0infographic\\xa0claiming sitting is deadly went viral. For hipsters and health nuts, sitting while you work is becoming practically taboo — but some daredevils maintain that the comfort factor offered by chairs outweighs the health risks.\\xa0The New Republic\\'s Ben Crair, for one, has publicly admitted that\\xa0he likes to sit, saying it feels \"fantastic.\" This month,\\xa0The Onion\\xa0reported on a new study suggesting people who sit for at least five hours a day are \"significantly more likely to be comfy.\" In the anti-sitters\\' latest salvo, researchers have shown that standing up may encourage more creative and collaborative group-work. Andrew Knight and Markus Baer, professors at the business school at Washington University in St. Louis, recruited 214 undergraduate students and broke them into groups of three to five. They assigned each group to work together for half an hour to write a script\\xa0for a college recruitment video, which would be judged for creativity as well as execution. All groups worked in conference rooms equipped with a whiteboard, easels, and markers, but half the groups worked in a room with five office chairs and a table — a \"sedentary workspace\" — while the other half worked in a room empty of table or chairs. Knight and Baer, who describe their results in\\xa0a new paper\\xa0in the journal\\xa0Social Psychological and Personality Science, hypothesized that the students in the chair-less room would feel less constricted and come up with more ideas. It turns out they didn\\'t see much of a difference in the end products, but the groups that worked in the unfurnished rooms showed higher signs of engagement and fewer signs of territoriality. Knight and Baer measured engagement by having participants wear wireless sensors that would monitor the activity of their sympathetic nervous system — known by psychologists to reflect arousal. The researchers judged how territorial participants felt over their own ideas by administering a survey after the experiment, having students rate statements like, \"Everyone in my group was protective of his or her ideas.\" \"Our results suggest that if leaders aspire to enhance collaborative knowledge work, they might consider eschewing the traditional conference room setup of tables and chairs and, instead, clear an open space for people to collaborate with one another,\" Knight and Baer conclude. Being possessive over your own ideas is one of the least helpful things you can do when working with others. And if a simple change of furniture could make people more inclined to prioritize the group goal, it\\'s probably something companies should consider. (Not to mention the health risks of sitting, which are well-established. The most thorough review of the evidence — a\\xa02012 paper\\xa0in the journal\\xa0Diabetologia\\xa0that took into account 18 studies involving nearly 800,000 people — found that the people who spent the most time sitting have nearly twice as high a risk of heart disease and diabetes as those who sat the least, even if they exercise regularly.) Knight and Baer aren\\'t the only ones exploring the psychological effects of standing. Some business psychologists and lay people looking to boost their productivity are also jumping on the standing bandwagon. As part of an experiment\\xa0for\\xa0New York\\xa0magazine, journalist Dan Kois spent an entire month on his feet (with exceptions for sleeping and defecating); he reported that he not only lost five pounds without trying but also cut his time-wasting \"drastically,\" getting more writing done than in any month he could remember. A Latvian start-up\\xa0installed a standing desk\\xa0in their office and had employees use an app to keep track of the amount of work they accomplished standing versus sitting; they concluded that standing up led to a 10% increase in productivity. Considering the evidence, it\\'s no surprise that more and more companies — from start-ups to large corporations like Google, Facebook, and AOL — are offering employees the option of using standing desks alongside traditional ones. Psychologists have shown that simply installing standing desks in an office is an effective way to get people to spend more of the day standing up. In an\\xa0Australian experiment\\xa0last year, a team of health researchers installed standing desks at a company in Sydney. Before they introduced the new desks, employees spent an average of 6.9 hours a day sitting at work; when the researchers checked back three months later, that number was down to 5.4. Most of the research on standing and productivity is based on small sample sizes (or in cases like Dan Kois\\'s experiment, a sample size of one). Standing desks could be just a fad. But even if the benefits have yet to be proven, many workers are embracing them. Scott Eichinger, who works in an office at the University of Maryland,\\xa0told\\xa0The\\xa0Washington Post\\xa0that working at a standing desk miraculously cured his headaches, back pain, and fatigue. His colleague Renee Sicchitano loved her standing desk so much that co-workers noticed her jumping for joy. Changing your stance probably won\\'t make you love a job you hate — but given that the\\xa0majority of us don\\'t like working in an office, anything that could make people less miserable about the prospect of spending all day in one is probably worth investigating.

       " '  London-based framebuilder Tom Donhou has managed 80 mph on a hand-made bicycle on the open road — though indoor tests ultimately revealed his bike was capable of reaching 102 mph.  Donhou\\'s bike is a custom-engineered contraption that he assembled with the help of a few friends, all for the purpose of showcasing the value of backyard engineering. And, of course, for making a bike go really fast. By comparison, the average person on a normal bike would probably have to push it to reach speeds around 25 mph.  See also: 8 Excellent Bike Mounts to Hold Your iPhone In order to get his bike up to super speed, Donhou added an oversized chainring, adding significant power to the pedaler. It features 104 teeth, compared to the 20 to 50 you\\'d find on a normal bike. Donhou also sought more stability by positioning the chainring lower to the ground, and lowering the handlebars. Image: Donhou Bicycles Donhou\\'s reconstructed his Ford Zephyr to fit in front of the bike and serve as a pace car and wind shield. The car\\'s frame blocks the wind while also providing Donhou with a form of speed control. In the video demonstration above, Donhou\\'s friend sits at the wheel while Donhou pedals, hard. The result is an extremely fast bike ride. \"We\\'d hit 80 mph; essentially I had outrun my car and we had run out of road,\" Donhou says in the video posted on his website. \"We went there to go as fast as we could, and I felt that we\\'d done that, and I was, you know, I was stoked,\" he says.   Although the world record for the fastest bike ride was set in 1995 by Fred Rompelberg, who reached 167 mph, Donhou\\'s experiment was reportedly never really about breaking records, but about the excitement of assembling something with such power. \"It\\'s about British engineering, it\\'s about backyard engineering,\" Donhou explains.

Ryckman and Yakus launched the audio technology company QSound along with Jimmy Iovine in 1986. \"Justin is an audiophile. He really understands quality audio,\" Ryckman said in an interview. \"We\\'ve worked with the world\\'s biggest artists, and not all of them have a focus on audio quality on their own; they look to their producers and their engineers. Justin loves technology, completely understands audio and he\\'s very powerful and respected in the entertainment community.\" Timberlake had last year\\'s top-selling album with his comeback effort, \"The 20/20 Experience.\" The singer, with a group of other investors, bought MySpace in 2011. AfterMaster\\'s technology will be offered in a chip that would be embedded in products such as mobile devices, headphones and televisions. It will also be available in software form for computers and streaming services. \"We think this is probably the biggest breakthrough in audio,\" Ryckman said. \"We can take any audio and make it substantially louder, clearer and fuller.\" AfterMaster software will be available for licensing on Dec. 1. Products with chips will launch early next year. \"AfterMaster takes the audio and keeps it musical and clean sounding, and takes it further than anyone\\'s taken it before in terms of quality, volume, size (and) depth. Everything about it enhances the audio without changing the intent of the creator,\" Yakus said in an interview. The company will announce its \"first partnerships in the near future,\" Ryckman said. AfterMaster is also launching an online music mastering service next month, where musicians can upload songs, receive a re-mastered version and decide to purchase it. ',\n",
       " '     Google Glass gets a bad rap as an invasive, in- and on-your-face technology that few people really understand or have much use for. However, for those who own Google\\'s wearable heads-up information device, it\\'s hard to deny the utility and possibilities.  One area where Google Glass shines is in capturing POV moments in a way that makes them seem much more current and personal. Take this short film, Seeds, for example. Without a single word, it manages to convey the touching, albeit fictional, story of impending parenthood and one young man\\'s journey back home to tell his beloved mother the good news. The 2:30-minute film was shot over the course of 10 days in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo and India by 23-year-old filmmaker Aneesh Chaganty, who wore Google Glass throughout the shoot. \"It was the first introduction to acting I\\'ve ever had,\" Chaganty told Mashable. He came up with the Mother\\'s Day-themed story and then wore the same clothes and a wedding ring for the duration of the two-week production.  See also: How Google Fumbled Glass — and How to Save It Chaganty, who graduated from the University of Southern California\\'s School of Cinematic Arts in 2013, made the film in concert with Google\\'s Glass Creative Collective. The Collective is funding Glass filmmaking around the country and provided the budget for Chaganty\\'s production. Obviously, Google, which posted the short film, has a vested interest in portraying Glass in the best possible light. After suffering a wave of criticism and controversy, Google\\'s been engaged in an aggressive campaign to remake Google Glass\\'s image. This video shows the film\\'s protagonist using Glass in a variety of situations, including in a taxi, at an airport, during the flight and when he surprises his mother. All touching, though it raises the question of whether or not people knew they were being filmed and, either way, would they think it was an invasion of privacy. \"We made it a very clear point to never show ... if someone was not aware that I was shooting, we would never show their full face. In fact there’s one part we blurred,\" said Chaganty who used both real people and actors throughout the shoot. The blurred face appears during a scene at the Tokyo airport. The woman who plays his mother, however, is show quite clearly. She\\'s Madhumani Palla, a well-known Indian actress. Working with Fruitvale Station co-producer Sev Ohanian, Chaganty, said he shot hours and hours of footage and handled Glass\\'s notoriously stingy battery life by carrying a collection of backup battery chargers in his pockets. Shooting a POV film with Glass proved challenging, \"To tell a story where average shot length is 15 or 16 frames, to be able to convey a story where literally every single frame counts … was really a challenge to shoot, but a lot of fun, to find those pieces and put that together,\" said Chaganty, who first picked up Glass in February of this year. With the film done and posted, the young filmmaker is looking ahead to shooting a feature with Ohanian and possibly shooting another Glass film.  Even though the touching film is fiction, it does have a direct connection to Chaganty\\'s real life. His parents, both Indian immigrants, grew up near where he shot the film in India. Chaganty\\'s mother was actually in India during the shoot and they traveled around her hometown together.

Now — amid widespread suspicion about the Kremlin\\'s role in the escalating political crisis in Ukraine that led to the recent downing of a Malaysian passenger jet — some say Putin and Russia should not be allowed to host the 2018 World Cup as planned if the geopolitical shenanigans continue.  But FIFA, world soccer\\'s governing body, has a simple message for those who want the 2018 World Cup moved: Nyet. See also: This Epic World Cup\\'s True Legacy? Hopefully Not Soccer Nick Clegg, Britain\\'s deputy prime minister, is among the latest high profile critics to blast Russia\\'s role in Ukraine\\'s deepening crisis and say Putin should not be rewarded with the glory of hosting the greatest event in world sports.  \"If he carries on with this belligerent behavior ... it\\'s unthinkable that he should have the privilege of hosting the World Cup in 2018,\" Clegg said of Putin this weekend, according to the Associated Press. \"You can\\'t have the beautiful game marred by the ugly aggression of Russia on the Russian-Ukrainian border.\" After Russia annexed the Eastern Ukraine region of Crimea, some critics already called for the 2018 World Cup to be moved, with that as the final straw on top of Putin\\'s already-restrictive social policies. Those cries flared up anew as fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels intensified in recent weeks.  Then the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17 by what is believed to be a surface-to-air missile launched from territory held by pro-Russian rebels killed all 298 passengers and crew-members on board the flight en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials have not said Russia directly played a role in the passenger jet being shot down — but that the Kremlin is responsible for \"creating the conditions\" that led to MH17 being shot down.  In arguing that the World Cup should be moved from Russia in 2018 if Putin does not play nicer with his neighbors, Clegg echoed a familiar line of criticism: That Putin uses global mega-events for profit, esteem and legitimacy on the world stage while conducting dirtier business away from the festive spotlight.  \"There\\'s no question he sees it for himself and for his prestige as a huge gain,\" Clegg said. \"The idea that the world should accord Russia that prestige is beyond belief. I don\\'t know how many people have got to be shot out of the skies before people say enough is enough.\" Meanwhile, German politician Peter Bueth told the newspaper Bild last week that \"if Putin doesn\\'t actively cooperate on clearing up the plane crash, the football World Cup in Russia in 2018 is unimaginable.\"  Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin, left, FIFA President Sepp Blatter, center, and Germany\\'s Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, watch the opening ceremony of the World Cup final soccer match between Germany and Argentina at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Sunday, July 13, 2014. Image: AP Photo/Martin Meissner/Associated PressBut FIFA — which runs the World Cup yet is notoriously criticized for widespread cronyism and corruption — says imagining the next World Cup anywhere else is pointless for now.  It issued a statement on Friday saying that \"the FIFA World Cup can be a force for good and FIFA believes this will be the case for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,\" per MLSSoccer.com.  The same day, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko released a separate statement in which he said, \"FIFA has stated many times that sport should be outside politics. Hosting an event like this, we\\'re doing it for athletes from all over the world, for footballers, for the fans.\" FIFA\\'s Friday statement also said that the World Cup \"can achieve positive change in the world.\"  Of course, one could argue the most glorious event in sports belongs in countries that have already achieved that positive change — as opposed to world leaders who have helped create violent and tragic circumstances in their own countries and others nearby.  But perhaps that\\'s simply too romantic a notion in 2014. BONUS: The Complete Guide to World Cup Nicknames   The Wonderful World Cup Team Nicknames        Algeria, \"Les Fennecs\" In honor of the national animal of Algeria, the national team is \"Les Fennecs,\" the small, nocturnal foxes native to North Africa.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Argentina, \"La Albiceleste\" As beautiful as it is eloquent, \"La Albiceleste\" means \"The White and Sky Blue,\" and refers to Argentina\\'s famous striped uniforms.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Australia, \"The Socceroos\" This is probably the kookiest nickname: Australia\\'s national team combines \"soccer\" and \"kangaroos.\" Now, you\\'ve got yourself the Australian squad.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Belgium, \"The Red Devils\" The Belgians are known affectionately in all three of the country\\'s spoken languages -- Dutch, French and German -- as \"The Red Devils.\"  The name was coined when a journalist called the Belgian squad \"The Red Devils\" after three \"devilish\" wins in 1906, just two years after forming.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Zmajevi\" Like Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina owes its nickname to a commentator who called the players \"zmajevi\" or \"dragons\" in 2010, and the name stuck.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Brazil, \"Seleção\" \"The Selection\" is Brazil\\'s nickname because it\\'s what Brazilians call every soccer team: a \"seleção. But only the national team is \"the \"Seleção.\" Brazil is also known as \"Canarihno\" (\"Little Canary\") due to the team\\'s bright yellow uniforms.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Cameroon, \"The Indomitable Lions\" Cameroon\\'s nickname is actually a nod to the country\\'s lion-preservation efforts. In the wild and on the pitch, the Cameroon lions or \"Lions\" are \"indomitable.\"  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Chile, \"La Roja\" The Chileans prefer simplicity, earning their nickname from the team\\'s notable red uniforms.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Colombia, \"Los Cafeteros\" \"Los Cafeteros\" loosely translates to \"one who makes or drinks coffee,\" and Colombians do both. The national team is nicknamed after one of Colombia\\'s biggest exports: coffee.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Costa Rica, \"Los Ticos\" \"Los Ticos\" is the shortened, more conversational name for \"Costarrincenses\" or \"native Costa Ricans.\"  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Croatia, \"Vatreni\" \"Vatreni\" means \"The Blazers\" in Croatian, a nod to both the passion of the players on the pitch and the fans in the stands. Lately, Croatia is also known as \"Bilic\\'s Boys,\" a reference to the team\\'s head coach, Slaven Bilic.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Ecuador, \"La Tricolor\" \"La Tricolor\" refers to the three colors of the Ecuadorian flag: yellow, blue and red.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         England, \"The Three Lions\" England\\'s namesake refers to the country\\'s rich history, going back to Richard the Lionheart, the King of England from 1189 to 1199. The three lions that appear on the national team\\'s crest also appear on the Royal Arms of England.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         France, \"Les Bleus\" The boys in \"bleu\" got their nickname because the color dominates the French team\\'s uniforms. It\\'s even a nickname for most teams across French sports.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Germany, \"Die Mannschaft\" Call it German efficiency: \"Die Mannschaft\" means \"The Team\" in German. Simple, practical and formidable when spoken.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Ghana, \"The Black Stars\" A refrence to the sole black star on Ghana\\'s national flag, the players of the national team are stars to their fans.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Greece, \"Ethniki\" \"Ethniki\" or \"national\" is Greece\\'s nickname. The Greek team is also known as \"Piratiko,\" after a Greek radio broadcaster who christened the team with the name during the opening ceremony of UEFA Euro 2004.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Honduras, \"Los Catrachos\" \"Los Catrachos\" is the name for native Hondurans, derived from General Florencio Xatruch who fought an American insurrectionist\\'s attempts to reintroduce slavery. Xatruch\\'s men were called \"xatruches,\" which then became \"catruches,\" and so on.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Iran, \"Team Melli\" Like other teams in the World Cup, \"Team Melli\" simply means \"National Team.\"   Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Italy, \"Azzurri\" Like France\\'s team, \"Azzurri\" means \"the blues.\" Though not part of the national flag colors, blue was the color of House Savoy which unified Italy in 1861.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Ivory Coast, \"Les Elephants\" Ivory Coast; ivory tusks. The national team is named \"Les Elephants\" due to their part in the 19th century ivory trade.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Japan, \"Samurai Blue\" Adorned in \"blue\" uniforms, the Japanese squad honors the country\\'s historical warriors, and become \"samurais\" on the pitch.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Mexico, \"El Tri\" Every national team\\'s nickname honors its country, but Mexico\\'s nickname \"El Tri\" conjures up intense national pride. A shortened \"El Tricolor,\" Mexico\\'s nickname refers to the three colors -- red, white and green -- of the Mexican flag.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Netherlands, \"Oranje\" Named for the team\\'s famous orange kits, the color is actually nowhere to be found on the Netherlands\\' flag. Instead it refers to the color of the old Dutch royal family: House of Orange-Nassau. The team\\'s invention of a precise method of passing to maintain ball control -- Total Football -- also earned the Dutch team the nickname and Kubrickian homage \"Clockwork Orange.\"  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Nigeria, \"The Super Eagles\" Nigeria\\'s nickname is rooted in classic one-upmanship. The national team adopted the nickname \"The Super Eagles\" after losing to Cameroon\\'s \"The Indomitable Lions\" in the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations finals.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Portugal, \"Seleção das Quinas\" Portugal\\'s nickname, \"The Selection of the Shields,\" refers to the five shields (the \"quinas\") and the five dots within each shield (the bezants) on the country\\'s flag.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Russia, \"Sbornaya\" Short on originality, but strong and powerful in pronunciation, Russia\\'s \"Sbornaya\" means \"National Team\" in Russian.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         South Korea, \"Taegeuk Warriors\" The \"taegeuk\" refers to the symbol on South Korea\\'s national flag, which represents a spiritual balance, similar to China\\'s yin and yang symbol. Also known as \"The Reds\" due to the team\\'s red uniforms, fans have called themselves the \"Red Devils\" since 1995.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Spain, \"La Furia Roja\" \"The Red Fury,\" Spain\\'s nickname, comes from two sources. \"La Roja,\" like other team nicknames, comes from the color of the team\\'s uniforms, while \"La Furia\" describes its \"direct, aggressive, spirited style\" of play in the 1920s -- a \"fury\" on the pitch.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Switzerland, \"La Nati\" The Swiss team kept its nickname short and to the point. \"La Nati,\" means \"The National Team\" in French. Due to the many languages used in Switzerland, the team is also known as \"Schweizer Nati\" in German and \"Squadra Nazionale\" in Italian, but they ultimately all mean the same thing.   Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         Uruguay, \"La Celeste\" Not quite Argentina\\'s \"La Albiceleste,\" but equally as beautiful when spoken, Uruguay\\'s \"La Celeste\" also refers to the team\\'s sky-blue uniforms.  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira         U.S.A., \"The Yanks\" Unlike other countries competing in the World Cup, the U.S. doesn\\'t have an official nickname. In the past, the team has been called \"The Yanks,\" but the jury\\'s still out on it being the official name of the U.S. Men\\'s National Team. Other nicknames include \"The Stars and Stripes\"  or just \"Team USA.\"  Image:  ESPN/Cristiano Siqueira      ',\n",

Tell them it\\'s NOT okay to drop The Weather Channel! http://t.co/lNvwjyPSqf — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) January 14, 2014  \\xa0 The Weather Channel is not happy about the move, an opinion clearly visible on its website. The network is asking DirecTV subscribers to call and complain to their satellite provider or congressional representative. The Weather Channel is also encouraging DirecTV subscribers to switch services by providing phone numbers and \"order\" buttons for 11 other cable providers. In a statement on its website, the network wrote: For 30+ years, The Weather Channel has been the most trusted resource for disseminating timely information to help prepare and protect families across the nation against weather-related emergencies. But now DIRECTV has removed this critical life-saving community resource from 20 million households. We’re working hard to let DIRECTV know how crucial The Weather Channel is to your family, your community, and your safety. You can help! The contract dispute surfaced after The Weather Channel said it asked for an increase in $0.01 per customer, per month, according to CNNMoney. DirecTV said the requested increase was \"substantially more\" than that, and added that it was reluctant because The Weather Channel uses 40% of its programming on reality TV shows. The Weather Channel is publicizing its battle with DirecTV on its website, which includes a view counter that shows more than 1.7 million people have visited the site. More than 150,000 people have called DirecTV to complain, according to CNNMoney.

Currently, The Guardian operates three websites. The primary one is guardian.co.uk. It has a second URL for its U.S. operation, guardiannews.com, which redirects to guardian.co.uk on section and article pages, and a subdomain for mobile, m.guardian.co.uk. Soon, it will unveil a fourth domain for its Australian edition. The Guardian describes the move as a symbolic one. \"As we set out on our mission to become a unified, global [organization], we now have one domain we can rally behind,\" Guardian U.S. CEO Michael Bloom said in an interview with Mashable last week. \"[And] it will be much easier for users and partners,\" he added. Symbolism and convenience aside, the reason the move is happening now is because the publication just acquired the rights to the domain from the Guardian Life insurance company, which used the URL to redirect to its main domain, guardianlife.com. The new domain experience, which is slated to launch this fall, won\\'t feel very different for readers. Visitors will still be directed to the right edition based on their IP address (i.e., location).  Bloom said The Guardian\\'s U.S. team now numbers more than 50, up from just five at launch two years ago. He added that The Guardian is also making \"key hires\" ahead of its debut in Australia later this year. The Guardian draws more than 80 million unique visitors per month, according to ABC figures.

       " ' Bacterial diseases cause millions of deaths every year. Most of these bacteria were benign at some point in their evolutionary past, and we don\\'t always understand what turned them into disease-causing pathogens. In a new study, researchers have tracked down when this switch happened in a flesh-eating bacteria. They think the knowledge might help predict future epidemics. The flesh-eating culprit in question is called GAS, or Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, a highly infective bacteria. Apart from causing flesh-eating disease, GAS is also responsible for a range of less harmful infections. It affects more than 600 million people every year, and causes an estimated 500,000 deaths. These bacteria appeared to have affected humans since the 1980s. Scientists think that GAS must have evolved from a less harmful streptococcus strain. The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reconstructs that evolutionary history. James Musser of the Methodist Hospital Research Institute and lead researcher of the study said, \"This is the first time we have been able to pull back the curtain to reveal the mysterious processes that gives rise to a virulent pathogen.\" Genetic gymnastics Musser\\'s work required analysis of the bacterial genetic data from across the world — a total of about 3,600 streptococcus strains were collected and their genomes recorded. It revealed that a series of distinct genetic events turned this bacteria rogue. First, foreign DNA moved into the original harmless streptococcus by horizontal gene transfer — a phenomenon that is common among bacteria. Such DNA is often provided by bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target bacteria. Picking up foreign genes can be useful because it can improve the bacteria\\'s survival. In this case, the foreign DNA that was incorporated in the host\\'s genome allowed the streptococcus cell to produce two harmful toxins. A further mutation to one of these toxin genes made it even more virulent. According to Musser, another horizontal gene transfer event made a good disease-causing pathogen into a very good one. The additional set of genes allowed it to produce proteins that suppress the immune system of those infected, making the infection worse. Marco Oggioni of the University of Leicester said, \"Because this study used data of the entire genome, all the genetic change could be observed. This makes it possible to identify molecular events responsible for virulence, as you get the full picture.\" Musser could also accurately date the genetic changes in GAS by using statistical models to, as it were, turn back the clock on evolution. They say the last genetic change, which made GAS a highly virulent bacteria, must have occurred in 1983. Continental drift That timing makes a lot of sense. \"The date we deduced coincided with numerous mentions of streptococcus epidemics in the literature,\" Musser said. Since 1983, there have been several outbreaks of streptococcus infections across the world. For example, in the UK, streptococcus infections increased in number and severity between 1983 and 1985. It is the same story for many other countries, with Sweden, Norway, Canada and Australia falling victim to what is now an inter-continental epidemic. The symptoms ranged from pharyngitis to the flesh-eating disease, necrotizing fasciitis. \"In the short term, this discovery will help us determine the pattern of genetic change within a bacteria, and may help us work out how often bacterial vaccines need to be updated,\" Musser said. \"In the long term, this technique may have an important predictive application — we may be able to nip epidemics in the bud before they even start.\" What Musser is suggesting is that if enough bacterial genomes are regularly recorded and monitored, there is a chance that mutations or gene transfers, such as those GAS experienced, could be found ahead of time. But Oggioni is skeptical. \"While making such predictions may not be possible, this research will have other applications,\" he said. \"Knowing which genetic changes happen when can help tailor drug discovery research in a certain direction.\" Oggioni added that Musser\\'s work with GAS is only a model. Using Musser\\'s methods to record the evolutionary histories of other pathogens could be quite useful to tackle the diseases they cause now and, perhaps, even those that they may cause in the future.

       " \" The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Shutl One-Line Pitch: A service that allows multichannel retailers to offer same-day delivery to customers in metro areas, typically for less than $10 per order. Why It's Taking Off: Helps retailers compete (affordably) against the likes of Amazon and Net-a-Porter, both of which offer same-day delivery in select cities. Anxious that Amazon would capture the lion's share of last-minute holiday purchases, retailers big (Walmart) and small (Shoptiques) piloted same-day shipping programs in the days leading to Christmas, sometimes at significant cost. Shutl is a software-based service that enables multichannel retailers (that is, retailers who sell both online and have at least one bricks-and-mortar location) to offer a comparable — and, seemingly, faster and more convenient — delivery service for customers. Shutl works with local courier services to coordinate deliveries between stores and customers on a 24/7 time schedule. Retailers can integrate Shutl into their checkout pages, where customers can select to have their order delivered ASAP (typically within an hour-and-a-half) or in a one-hour window later that day, so long as they live within a 10-mile radius of a retailer's physical store location. The price varies depending on distance and delivery time, but typically costs $10 or under, says Tom Allason, founder and CEO of Shutl. For comparison, Amazon's same or next-day delivery service costs $3.99 per item for Prime subscribers, or $8.99 + $0.99 per item for non-Prime subscribers. Shutl, which was founded in London in 2009, says it can now reach about 75% of the UK populace through partnerships with large-volume UK retailers including Argos, which has 740 stores in the UK. The service launched in the U.S. in three metro areas — New York, San Francisco and Chicago — on Tuesday, although no U.S. retail partners have yet been announced. Shutl is planning to expand to Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, Montreal, Toronto and potentially Vancouver later this year. The company currently has a team of about 35, two-thirds of which are engineers. In the U.S., Shutl faces competition from the likes of Postmates, a 16-hour/day service that promises one-hour deliveries in San Francisco (and soon, elsewhere) for $6.95 and up; and TaskRabbit, which allows users to contract individuals to do errands for them (prices vary). Unlike Shutl, however, both services work directly with consumers rather than as retail partners. Shutl has raised approximately $8.7 million in funding to date. Its investors include UPS, Hummingbird Ventures, e.ventures and Notion Capital. Image via iStockphoto, kozmoat. \",\n",

       " ' Facebook announced Wednesday morning that Graph Search has been formally rolled out to all Facebook users utilizing the network in U.S. English. Graph Search, a relatively new feature unveiled in January, was already in use by some users who chose to opt-in to the feature as beta testers, but will now be automatically available to the rest of the users on the site.  Graph Search enables Facebook users to better curate content from the network or even search for nearby restaurants or music recommendations by their friends. When the feature was first announced, it was viewed by many as a step toward competition with Google in the \\'search\\' category, although Graph Search sticks primarily to Facebook content. In the instance where a search can\\'t successfully return what you\\'re looking for from Facebook, the feature defaults automatically to a web search powered by Microsoft\\'s Bing, not Google.   See also: Facebook: Here\\'s How Your News Feed Works Now that users can more easily search the site for information on their friends\\' profiles, they may also want to revisit Facebook\\'s privacy settings to ensure information is shared only with those they approve of. In a post announcing the new change, Facebook highlighted that Graph Search will continue to evolve over time, stating that the company will, \"continue to work on other improvements to Graph Search, such as searching for posts, comments and mobile.\" There is no potential timeline for mobile integration, nor is there an expected timeline for when Graph Search will be available to users in different languages, according to a Facebook spokesperson.

Rob Ford kicked off his re-election campaign for mayor at an event on Thursday in Toronto, complete with bagpipes blaring, signs reading \"Ford Nation,\" and lots of swag on sale — bobblehead dolls, mugs and buttons. The first 1,000 in the door received a free Canadian flag and, naturally, a \"Ford Nation\" t-shirt.  The mayor strolled into the Toronto Congress Centre with bagpipes blaring, then got up on stage and declared he would not \"back down\" from the fight ahead.

Ford has vowed to get those powers back. Thus, the re-election campaign. “You’ve always had my back and I will always have yours,” Ford said, according to the\\xa0Toronto Sun.\\xa0“None of us can go through life without making mistakes.

       " '  The U.S. Army had to destroy its futuristic space weapon during a test launch at its remote Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska on Monday. The Department of Defense says it was conducting a test of its Advanced Hypersonic Weapon when a flight anomaly forced flight engineers to terminate the launch shortly after liftoff.  See also: DARPA Is Developing \\'Transformers\\'-Style Flying Drones Defense Department spokesperson Maureen Schumann said the termination was done \"to ensure public safety,\" and that officials were conducting an extensive investigation to determine what caused the launch to go awry.  Shortly after 4 a.m. EDT, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command, as part of the Defense Department\\'s Conventional Prompt Global Strike technology development program, conducted a flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon from the Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska. Due to an anomaly, the test was terminated near the launch pad shortly after lift-off to ensure public safety. There were no injuries to any personnel.  Officials are trying to determine what caused the anomaly, but they believe debris fell within the grounds of the commercial spaceport, located about 44 miles south of the city of Kodiak on Kodiak Island, off Alaska\\'s southern coast. The video below shows the aftermath of the explosion:   The Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, named Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (or HTV-2 for short), is a DARPA project that has been in testing for nearly five years.   It was developed by Sandia National Laboratory — a Lockheed Martin subsidiary — and the U.S. Army as part of the military\\'s \"Conventional Prompt Global Strike\" technology development program, which aims to build a weapon that can destroy targets anywhere on Earth within one hour. A presentation created by Sandia National Laboratory\\'s David L. Keese, Director, Integrated Military Systems, details the challenges of creating such a weapon:  A slide from a Sandia National labs presentation details the company\\'s foreseen challenges in creating a precision strike weapon.According to Lockheed Martin, the HTV-2 is a \"multiyear research and development effort to increase the technical knowledge base and advance critical technologies to make long-duration hypersonic flight a reality.\" It would make the commute between Brooklyn and LA faster than a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. Falcon HTV-2 is an unmanned, rocket-launched, maneuverable aircraft that glides through the Earth’s atmosphere at incredibly fast speeds—Mach 20 (approximately 13,000 miles per hour). At HTV-2 speeds, flight time between New York City and Los Angeles would be less than 12 minutes. The HTV-2 vehicle is a “data truck” with numerous sensors that collect data in an uncertain operating envelope. The agency intends for the HTV-2 to be the fastest aircraft ever built. DARPA says it’s designed to fly anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes, a capability that requires an aircraft that can fly at 13,000 miles per hour, while experiencing temperatures in excess of 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.  A Darpa-supplied representation of the HTV-2.Image:  DARPA\"Air doesn’t travel around you — You rip it apart,\" as DARPA puts it on its website. On a typical test launch, the HTV-2 travels aboard a launch vehicle, as it reaches near-space heights. It then detaches from the vehicle, re-entering Earth’s upper atmosphere.   Image:  DARPAFrom there, the aircraft glides along while researchers test its aerodynamic performance before it dives into the ocean. HTV-2 has been tested several times after its first flight in 2010, during which time it experienced several flight anomalies. Officials continue to adjust the aircraft in an effort to finalize the craft. There are three technical challenges DARPA lists on its website dedicated to the project: Aerodynamics (it travels 22x faster than a commercial jetliner), Aerothermal Effects (those temperatures are \"hotter than a blast furnace capable of melting steel\") and Guidance, Navigation & Control. (\"Imagine trying to steer around a pothole in the highway while traveling 3.6 miles per second.\") In 2008, a suborbital rocket with two NASA hypersonic experiments on board was similarity destroyed shortly after liftoff. The majority of the debris fell into the Atlantic Ocean but some was reportedly spotted on land. Officials warned civilians not to touch it, stating the debris could be hazardous. \"NASA is very disappointed in this failure but has directed its focus on protecting public safety and conducting a routine confirmation of the effectiveness of its range safety operations,\" NASA said at the time.

According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, they will be following detailed instructions from the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) on the handling of the remains of Thomas Eric Duncan.  See also: How Different Countries Are Screening for Ebola The detailed guidelines recommend including enclosing the body in two bags and disinfecting the bags, after which the body can be transported without the need for protective gear. Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed with the deadly virus while in the United States, passed away on Wednesday morning. \"This is a difficult time for the family, and our thoughts are with them,\" said Dr. David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner. \"We will continue to treat Mr. Duncan with dignity and respect, and we\\'re taking great care to make sure there is no additional risk that others could be infected.\" After preparing and disinfecting the body, the remains will be cremated. CDC guidelines say remains infected with Ebola can be cremated or \"buried promptly in a hermetically sealed casket.\" Duncan\\'s family has agreed to his cremation. The CDC noted that the remains of Ebola victims pose a high risk to those handling them. \"As in Africa, we are concerned that handling of individuals who have passed away from Ebola is a high risk procedure,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden. “The patient who died earlier today, his human remains will be safely removed and safely handled so they will not present a risk.\" According to a statement from the Texas Department of State Health Services, the cremation process will \"kill any virus in the body so the remains can be returned to the family.

       " ' It’s a mantra hammered into the heads of anyone who has ever owned a business, worked in a service industry or stepped foot in the world of sales: “The customer is always right.”  Beyond simply placating customers, however, the modern take on this tried-and-true saying has evolved into what some refer to as \"relationship marketing,\" or the art of building connections, rapport and personal relationships with customers. Today, customer relationship management (CRM) is an increasingly important aspect of running a business — and a successful strategy is an extremely useful tool for almost any business model. Here\\'s what six different entrepreneurs offer as advice about cultivating customer relationships, building customer rapport and CRM best practices. 1. Know That Happy Customers = Returning Customers Lee Hnetinka, co-founder and CEO of WunWun, has strong customer relationships to thank for his growing business.  “Most of our business comes from relationships. Most of our users come from current users,” says Hnetinka. “Relationships are huge.” Making (and keeping) customers happy has benefits that stretch beyond simply having satisfied patrons. Happy customers are more likely to refer your service, product or business to their friends, family and colleagues — and this grapevine effect is invaluable.  In turn, a great CRM strategy builds brand loyalty and improves your business\\' reputation. Satisfied customers who feel as if their needs are being met — or ideally, exceeded — are more likely to speak positively of your business, or review and rate it highly online. 2. Set and Manage Realistic Expectations  One of the most important factors that goes into an effective CRM strategy is providing customers and clients with realistic expectations — and following through with them, says Alexandre Winter, co-founder and CEO of Placemeter. \"The worst you can do is disappoint your users or customers. You might think you will sound lame if you under-promise, but you will never regret it,\" says Winter.  When in doubt, under-promising and over-delivering is preferable to setting wildly unrealistic expectations that you — or your company — simply can\\'t deliver. 3. Be a Connector Allyson Downey, weeSpringco-founder and CEO, offered advice for maintaining professional relationships in a recent article on business networking: \"Be a connector. The first thing you should ask yourself when meeting someone new is, \\'What can I do for this person?\\' It sounds a little self-helpy, but everyone needs something: a dentist, a lunch suggestion, help fixing their Wi-Fi network. Be the person who can make those introductions, and these connections will pay dividends to you for decades,\" says Downey. 4. Keep Documentation Downey also suggests keeping track of important customer details (names, birthdays, kids\\' names and other relevant information), as well as sending cards or personal notes to customers at least once every year. Downey urges business owners to go beyond the typical address book or spreadsheet to track customer or client information. \"Entrepreneurs are managing hundreds — thousands! — of relationships, and I\\'m always astounded when I hear they\\'re just using Google spreadsheets. A CRM isn\\'t just for customer relationship management; we use Salesforce (with Cirrus Insight) to keep track of reporters, investors, prospective hires and more.\" 5. Respond Promptly Elliot Hirsch, founder and CEO of AdYapper, believes that quick responses can leave a lasting impact on customers. Prompt responses to customer inquiries, feedback or comments can be the difference between a mediocre client relationship and a great one. \"We live in a real-time world, and our clients have diverse schedules, so we feel strongly that immediate responses to requests — personal and within minutes, even a simple \\'message received, can we help you with anything else in the meantime?\\' acknowledgement — are very important and deliver a big Wow. It seems minor, but it goes a very long way to demonstrate not only how much we truly care, but also showcases the clear benefits of using young nimble companies like us, as opposed to old incumbents,\" says Hirsch. 6. Think Like a Salesperson Matt Hartman, founder of ReferBoost, previously worked on the tech side of startups. While he recruited a few ReferBoost customers through personal relationships, he struggled when it came to referrals. \"As a product person and engineer, I was not used to traditional \\'sales.\\' Simple things like setting calendar reminders to follow up made the difference between success and failure,\" he says. Landlords who\\'d said no to his startup had fallen off his radar.  But things changed when he started acting like a salesperson. \"Employing even the most rudimentary customer relationship management of touching base and following-up regularly, I was surprised at how many of those Nos eventually became Yeses. Even when the pitch and product weren\\'t materially different — the only thing that changed was persistence.\" Do you have any additional tips on best practices for CRM?

       " ' It\\'s becoming an annual tradition: Samsung will unveil the next generation of its Galaxy Note smartphone in advance of the IFA technology conference in Berlin. The company sent invitations to the press on Monday for an event on Sept. 4, two days before the first day of the conference. Like previous device unveilings, Samsung is calling the event \"Samsung Unpacked 2013.\" The event will be live streamed via the web, and Samsung will host a press event at the same time in New York City\\'s Times Square for people to watch and get hands-on time with the devices. See also: 10 Free Android Apps You\\'ll Use Every Day Samsung isn\\'t officially revealing information about the devices. However, the invitation and subsequent tweet (see below) include the phrase, \"Note the Date\" (emphasis added). Plus, at the two previous IFA events, Samsung released the first and second generations of its Galaxy Note smartphone, which have extremely large screens relative to other phones.  Samsung #UNPACKED 2013 Episode 2. Note the date. pic.twitter.com/XkNBXXc8Bp — Samsung Mobile (@SamsungMobile) August 5, 2013  Thus, it\\'s a foregone conclusion that Samsung will unveil the Galaxy Note 3 (or III) at its September event. It\\'s been almost a year since the company released the Galaxy Note 10.1. The question on everyone\\'s mind this time: Just how big will Samsung go?  Competitors have responded to the Galaxy Note\\'s success (now at 5.5 inches with the Note II) with large screen sizes as well, including the 5.5-inch LG Optimus G Pro and 5-inch Droid Ultra. Samsung itself debuted the 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega earlier this year. Samsung\\'s other plans for Sept. 4 also remain unknown. Last year, it took the wraps off several new devices, including its ATIV line of Windows 8 PCs, the first phone to run Windows Phone 8, and the Android-powered Galaxy Camera point-and-shoot. We\\'ll likely see more focus this year, but Samsung could still surprise — perhaps with an entry into wearable computing. Its rumored smart watch is called \"Gear.\" What do you think Samsung has in store for Sept. 4? Let us know in the comments.

       " \" For marketing professionals, sitting in a cubicle is something like a paradox. They're creative, resourceful and observant of our surroundings — and being confined to a literal box can really cramp their capabilities. Luckily for those who work in marketing, companies are now considering remote employees more than ever, giving marketers an opportunity to work from a coffee shop, at home or anywhere that's going to allow them to be more productive. In fact, there are a number of opportunities out there for work-from-homers — specifically in the digital marketing world and with tech companies that are increasingly advocating for virtual work environments. So, if you’ve ever thought about taking your marketing career out of the office, take a look at these types of positions. 1. Product Marketing Manager If you love both tech and marketing, check out Product Marketing Manager roles, where you’ll manage new product releases and the internal communications, messaging and positioning that surround them. While many companies want their Product Marketing Managers based on-site to interact with other team members, you can have success working for start-ups that are tight on space or companies that value virtual work.\\xa0For example, Santa Barbara-based cloud computing startup RightScale offers many work-from-home positions — and is currently hiring a remote\\xa0Product Marketing Manager\\xa0who can be based in California, Seattle or Denver. You Should Have: Tech savvy. Product Marketing Managers typically work with software and web-based products, so a passion for and experience in this world is ideal. 2. Marketing Copywriter Recently rated one of the best jobs in the marketing and advertising industry, copywriting is an obvious choice for a work-from-home gig. After all, the work you produce — including web copy, ebooks, sales materials, blogs and articles — says far more than the hours you clock in at an office. It isn’t difficult to find full-time work-from-home copywriting positions for companies or marketing agencies on sites like FlexJobs; or, if you’d like to freelance, check out Freelance Writing Jobs and ProBlogger’s Job Board. You Should Have: Awesome writing skills is a given, but you should also have a handle on SEO. Companies want writing that they know will get seen on the web. 3. Marketing Analyst If you’re extremely detail-oriented and love crunching numbers, this is a cool opportunity to do from home. In a position that requires you to analyze data and turn it into brand or marketing strategy, a quiet, uninterrupted work environment allows you to be more productive. These types of roles vary in both scope and experience — for example, United Health Group is hiring a Senior Marketing Research Analyst to perform high-level research and make recommendations on that data, and an e-commerce company is seeking a telecommuting SEO Analyst Assistant to perform SEO research and data entry. You Should Have: Depends on the role, but most likely a combination of analytical skills and strategic thinking. And an understanding of SEO is a big bonus. 4. Content Strategist If you’re currently blogging, chances are you already understand how content marketing works. So, why not use your expertise to show companies how to be successful with the same methods? As a Content Strategist, you’ll work with brands to determine what type of content they need based on their goals — then, you’ll work to develop that strategy through campaigns, projects and editorial calendars. There are plenty of opportunities available for full-time and contract roles, but I’ve also seen people have success pitching their skills to businesses they want to work with. If you’re hired on a project basis and deliver great results, that’s a great case for hiring you full-time. Make a list of places you want to work, pitch them your idea and learn from the process. You Should Have: Proven success with blogging or content strategy. 5. Digital Marketing Consultant This is probably the most flexible role of all, and if you have several years of experience and proven success in digital marketing, it could be the ideal gig for you. As a bonus, consultants are generally paid well, as companies rely on their expertise to take their company to the next level. One option is working for a digital marketing firm, which are often hired to analyze current digital marketing processes and policies, provide thought leadership, and strategize with teams on improved performance. Or, you can strike out on your own as a freelance consultant, where you can choose exactly what types of work and clients you take on. This can be a great fit if you’re looking to carve out an industry niche for yourself. Think social media for fashion and beauty clients or brand strategy work for healthcare organizations. You Should Have: Several years of experience, ideally deep expertise in one or two specific sets of skills.

       " ' I spent the first few years of my freelance career earning an income the way most freelancers do: working project-to-project and billing by the hour. Sure, I made enough to pay the bills. And the job came with perks like being able to work from anywhere. But if I wanted to take a vacation I’d have to take a pay cut, since I couldn’t earn an income when I wasn’t working. Most of all, I couldn’t level up and grow. My business simply wasn’t scalable. So I made it my mission over these past few years to change that. See also: 7 Affordable Resources for Self-Employed Workers I explored a number of alternative business models to break free of billing by the hour or per project. I’ll share three different routes I explored with varying success. Each has its benefits and drawbacks. My hope is that you can learn from my experiences to choose your next steps wisely. Selling templates and/or software If you’re a coder/designer like I am, then your first notion is probably to develop software or some kind of downloadable template. After all, we see so many others who find success this way. The most prominent example is Basecamp, formerly 37signals, which began as a web design consulting company and transitioned to products when its software Basecamp took off. For freelance web designers, releasing a design template is a reasonable first step toward releasing your first digital product. That’s what I did when I sold WordPress themes as my first product. It was a thrill to create something and earn a little money from something other than client work. But that first venture was far from the full-time salary replacement I had dreamed of. The benefits:  Digital download products can generate revenue while you sleep or go on vacation. You get to build something to your own specs, not adhere to the requirements set by a client.  The drawbacks:  The costs (time and money) of creating a template or software are much higher than they may seem. There are many more variables to take into account and all sorts of challenging UX problems to solve (granted, most of us find these problems exciting). Gaining traction for a software product is extremely difficult, especially if you’ve never marketed one before. If you’re self-funding your efforts, you’ll have to balance client work or a full-time job while building your product during nights and weekends. This can be extremely stressful and it’s difficult to make progress quickly.  Educational products Since you’re already an expert in your field and you’ve been selling this expertise to clients in the form of consulting hours, why not package your know-how into an educational product? An educational product like an e-book or course can be a much more scalable way to offer your solution to a common problem. As a digitally delivered product, you can create it once and sell copies for a long time to come. Or you can teach a live workshop online or in person, which is a great way to share knowledge to a large group rather than one client at a time. The true benefit of an educational product is it can serve as a jumping off point for so many new opportunities. Here are a couple of examples: Joanna Wiebe of Copy Hackers took her expertise as a copywriter and packaged it in a series of e-books. These not only helped tons of business owners improve their copy (me included), they also helped Wiebe raise her profile and grow her audience. Copy Hackers can leverage its audience as it releases new products like its latest one, Disco, a user survey tool. In 2013, I released my first educational product, an e-book called Design For Conversions. It sold fairly well, but certainly didn’t replace my full-time income. But it helped to jump-start my audience, which has been growing ever since. Now, I’m much better positioned to release my next educational product, a course called Productize. The benefits:  Based on topics you’re already an expert in. Relatively low time investment to product compared to building software. Requires little or no ongoing customer support. Can build your profile and open up new opportunities.  The drawbacks:  Easier to gain traction when you already have an audience, though not a requirement. Requires a great deal of writing, speaking and teaching, which can sometimes be challenging for those with less experience.  Productized service The third alternative model to billing by the hour might be a fairly new concept for most. In fact, it’s often overlooked, making it a unique opportunity for freelancers to jump on. I’m talking about productized services. By positioning your service as a product, you can offer a compelling value proposition with a set price and predefined scope. That eliminates a lot of the pre-project legwork like writing proposals and coming up with estimates. A productized service, sometimes referred to as productized consulting, can offer a lot of other attractive benefits too. It can be systematized to run with or without you as the founder. It’s also a fantastic way to build revenue month after month. Let’s look at a few examples: Nick Disabato launched Draft Revise, a monthly A/B testing service to help customers improve conversions. Jane Portman offers her monthly creative direction for startups, which she positions as a product called Correlation. Both bring a steady income and allow them to focus solely on the craft they’re most passionate about, rather than being a “jack of all trades, master of none.” As I built up my productized service, Restaurant Engine, it eventually allowed me to replace my income as a freelance web designer and helped me focus on the bigger picture: scaling up and growing my team. The benefits:  Built around a service you already do. Low barrier to entry. Priced based on value, not time. Potential for recurring revenue. Can be systematized and scaled up.  The drawbacks: Largely built around manual processes. Though I see this as an opportunity to gain traction quickly, then automate and grow with systems. If you think productizing might be a viable path out of billable hours, then you might find my free email course on productizing your service helpful as you begin this journey.

       " ' After four months and more than 3 million comments, the public input period for the Federal Communications Commission\\'s Internet regulations is coming to a close. The sheer numbers could be lauded as a victory for democracy in which the Internet came together to save itself, with studies showing overwhelming support for net neutrality. But the Internet does not decide on regulation — the FCC\\'s five commissioners do. See also: FCC and net neutrality: What you need to know The issue now becomes just how much of an impact that past few months of comments have had on the issue. Net neutrality advocates that spoke to Mashable maintain that it has made a difference, making the much-ballyhooed reclassification of broadband as a viable option.  \"If you go back to the spring, when there was the leak of what the FCC was potentially proposing, then we were talking about something that is very different from what we are talking about right now,\" said Michael Weinberg of Public Knowledge, a non-profit that has come out in support of reclassification. Not everyone agrees. Chris Guttman-McCabe, executive vice president of The Wireless Association, a trade group that represents the telecommunications industry, noted that reclassification has been a major part of the debate on net neutrality for years.  \"The issues are the same. It\\'s Title II versus not Title II,\" he said  \"Obviously there were a great number of comments, but there were a great number of comments back in 2012 as well. I think the issues are still the same.\" Reading the tea leaves The FCC declined to comment on how the comment period had impacted debate within the regulator, but indications from Chairman Tom Wheeler have shown that reclassification has gone from a non-option to being on the table.  Initial drafts of the proposed rules did not mention reclassification as an option, but public outcry that began even before the proposed rules had been opened for public comment helped put Title II into official consideration. More recently, Wheeler responded to congressional calls for reclassification with a letter in which he says the FCC is \"seriously considering moving forward to adopt rules using Title II of the Communications Act as the foundation for our legal authority.\" Widespread concern followed news that the FCC was beginning to write a proposal for new Internet regulations about how data travels across the Internet. Critics argued that the new regulation would allow ISPs to charge content providers in exchange for preferential treatment of data. The public has spoken The public outcry — including an analysis of more than 1.1 million comments that were found to be overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality — puts the FCC in a difficult position.  Previous Internet regulations have been have been struck down by courts as being too expansive, sending the FCC back to the drawing board. Its newest proposal, which attempted to institute an enforceable standard for any deals struck between ISPs and websites, had been seen as opening the door to Internet \"fast lanes\" and detrimental to the open and free nature of the web. Reclassification has been roundly rejected by ISPs who warn that this type of regulation would burden companies and limit incentives to invest in Internet infrastructure. To advocates, net neutrality is a crucial concept for the future of the Internet. However, it can be difficult to translate that into sound bites that capture a broader audience. Enter John Oliver, whose segment in June helped bring mass attention to the issue.  Althea Erickson, policy director for Etsy, one of the most outspoken Internet companies in favor of reclassification, said that the coverage of net neutrality had been an important element in drawing so much popular support. \"I think at the beginning, net neutrality was pretty wonky as a topic and something that was not well understood,\" said Erickson, who will also participate an FCC roundtable. \"Over time, as the media and public interest groups and companies have helped explain it in a way that makes sense to consumers and small business, people are understanding how threats to net neutrality are threats to their freedom of expression and their freedom to start companies.\" In lieu of the proposed rules, net neutrality advocates have rallied around reclassification — a move that would see allow that FCC to write more stringent regulations. \"I think that right now we are in a place to get strong net neutrality rules that were almost impossible this spring,\" said Weinberg, who will participate in upcoming roundtable discussions with the FCC on net neutrality. Inside the beltway The clamor has also made its way to Washington, D.C., and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler\\'s doorstep. Politicians have jumped into the fray — numerous Democrats have backed reclassification while Republicans have opposed it. President Barack Obama has also criticized the initial proposal, but stopped short of advocating for reclassification.   House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi just told the @FCC she backs Title II reclassification of broadband: http://t.co/zVtXmf8Oh0 — John Hendel (@JohnHendel) September 8, 2014  The emergence of reclassification as the key delineator has caused a distinct rift on how the FCC should proceed, according to Rick Chessen, a senior vice president of law & regulatory policy for the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. \"The discussion has unfortunately become more polarized and negative as certain advocates have resorted to scare tactics and overheated rhetoric as a way to convince policymakers that the Internet is in shambles and will utterly fail unless we regulate it like a public utility,\" Chessen wrote in an email. \"This of course is not even remotely based in fact but it makes for good headlines and generates a lot of anger on social media and elsewhere.\" Politicians hold plenty of sway in D.C., but public pressure can also have definite consequences. Glaser pointed to another case that drew significant public outcry — efforts by the FCC to roll back regulations on media ownerships. A court eventually ruled against the FCC. \"The FCC is required to act in the interest of the public,\" she April Glaser, a staff activist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"When they do the opposite of that, they could actually be in a scenario where they\\'re not following the law.\" BONUS: What Is Net Neutrality?        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

At the memorial, U.S. President Barack Obama shook hands with Cuba\\'s President Raul Castro. The two met while Obama was greeting a line of world leaders and heads of state gathered at the FNB Stadium. This was the first formal greeting between American and Cuban leaders since 2000, when Bill Clinton shook Fidel Castro\\'s hand at the United Nations. See also: 11 Inspiring Moments to Remember Nelson Mandela The handshake came as the United States and Cuba are taking baby steps toward repaired relations.

She even called off a visit to Washington in September to protest the reported NSA spying on Brazil\\'s state oil agency Petrobras.   Nelson Mandela died on Thursday at the age of 95 after a life of fighting to bring people together, with the defeat of apartheid as his biggest victory. At the memorial, Obama praised Mandela and compared him to great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. \"For nothing he achieved was inevitable,\" Obama said during the service. \"In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, persistence and faith.

       " ' The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: FoodFan One-Liner Pitch: FoodFan\\'s \"Select\" membership program gives members up to 30% off their restaurant bill at great restaurants any time, without any restrictions. Why It\\'s Taking Off: FoodFan is taking a different approach to the daily deal market. It\\'s easy to find restaurant deals online, but there always seems to be a catch, whether it\\'s the fine print, blackout dates or required reservations.  FoodFan, a New York-based startup, is trying to make it easier to receive discounts at select restaurants. FoodFan’s membership program, FoodFan Select, allows members to dine at top rated restaurants at any time, and always receive 15 – 30% off the entire bill. There are no blackout dates or times, and no reservations or coupons needed. After signing up, Select members receive a sleek membership card in the mail. When you dine at one of Select’s partner restaurants that are listed on FoodFan\\'s site and mobile app, all you need to do is present the card with the bill and you’ll receive up to 30% off the total amount. Select\\'s partner restaurants are mostly higher-end restaurants located in the New York City area. The minimum criteria for many of these restaurants are three and a half stars on Yelp, and a 20 or higher Zagat rating. The startup plans to add more restaurants to its list each month. \"Restaurants want to attract high quality customers, encourage them to spend more and most importantly, get them to come back,\" Carlo Cisco, founder and CEO of FoodFan, told Mashable in an interview. \"That’s exactly what FoodFan does.\" The inspiration for FoodFan came about while Cisco was working as a consultant for daily deal site, Groupon. Cisco found flaws in the deal model and realized that businesses actually lose money when they attract customers who are only interested in deep discounts. This is why, he said, less than 20% of those customers ever return. So in 2011, he founded FoodFan and then created the Select membership model.   \"On the customer side, it\\'s frustrating for diners who are forced to pre-purchase meals in advance and are subject to extensive stipulations, short time expirations, and embarrassing vouchers,\" Cisco said. \"With Select, diners receive a consistent 15% to 30% off the full bill at some of the best restaurants in their city, anytime they dine.\" Select membership costs $8.99 a month. Most Select members are in the age range of 25 to 45, and more than half of them make more than six figures a year. Apart from the Select program, FoodFan also makes it easy to find and share great restaurants. The startup has more than 900,000 New York restaurant listings, menus, photos, ratings and reviews from users and trusted critics, including New York magazine, The New York Times, Michelin, Eater NY, Time Out Magazine and Bloomberg Dining. Users can search for restaurants by name, cuisine, location, price or star ratings. They can also make reservations at certain restaurants through Al404 and FoodFan ',\n",
       " ' Ron Burgundy, the fictional news anchor from Anchorman, is making a foray into book publishing to write a memoir. That\\'s right — the news anchor behind the most epic jazz flute solo of the \\'70s, who said Sports Center would never work — will pen an autobiography about his life guzzling milk and cuddling dogs. See also: \\'Anchorman\\' Stays Classy in 8-Bit Remake The memoir, Let Me Off at the Top!: My Classy Life and Other Musings, will be published by Crown Archetype, an imprint of Random House\\'s Crown Publishing Group.

Breaking news: Legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy has written a tell-all autobiography LET ME OFF AT THE TOP! http://t.co/wycO1S58XO — Crown Publishing (@CrownPublishing) August 13, 2013  The memoir will reveal never-before-told tales from Burgundy\\'s childhood as well as some of the events that helped him grow into the broadcast beast he is today. Burgundy is known to most as the lead anchorman of San Diego\\'s Action 4 News Team, as well as the anchor of the first 24-hour news channel, GNN.  “I don’t know if it’s the greatest autobiography ever written. I’m too close to the work,” the fake news personality said in a statement. “I will tell you this much: The first time I sat down and read this thing, I cried like a goddamn baby, and you can take that to the bank.” “The list of legendary American broadcast news journalists is short: Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and, of course, Ron Burgundy,” said Mauro DiPreta, vice president and editor in chief at Crown Archetype.  Jack Fogg, the editorial director at the branch of Random House that will publish the book in the UK and Australia, added that Burgundy\\'s influence on news reading is evident in the work of other legends such as Richard Baker, Moira Stuart, Brian Henderson and Jeremy Paxman.

       " ' Rodrigo Diaz, a 22-year-old Georgia man, was shot and killed after his GPS device directed him to the wrong house, his friends who were with him at the time of the shooting claim. Diaz and the others in his car were trying to pick up a friend to go ice skating Saturday night. However, Diaz\\'s friends say his GPS device mistakenly led him to the home of 69-year-old Phillip Sailors.  Sailors, mistaking the situation for a home invasion, appeared outside of his home with a .22-caliber handgun. He fired one round in the air then another at the car while Diaz was attempting to speed away. The second shot hit Diaz in the head and he later died as a result, according to WSBTV. \"The guy came out,\" 15-year-old passenger Yeson Jimenez told WSBTV. \"He went in again and he came out with a gun in his hand and he shot into the air.\" Diaz had recently arrived in the United States from Colombia.  Sailors, a Vietnam War veteran, was arrested Sunday on a charge of malice murder, or murder committed with the specific intent to kill. He has no previous criminal history. His lawyers told WSBTV that Sailors is innocent and was merely trying to defend his home and his family. \"We maintain Mr. Sailors\\' innocence. I can tell you Mr. Sailors most certainly thought he was defending his life, his wife\\'s and protecting his home,\" attorney Mike Puglise said. Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, binabina ',\n",

       " ' Additional documents about Michael Brown\\'s death were released by the St. Louis County prosecutor on Monday, but a key interview transcript is still missing of a two-hour FBI and county police interview with Brown\\'s friend, Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown when he was shot. A federal autopsy reached similar conclusions as those performed by local officials and a private examiner hired by Brown\\'s family, documents show. See also: Raw City: Inside Ferguson\\'s War at Home The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System\\'s autopsy on the 18-year-old Brown, conducted at the request of the Department of Justice, was among grand jury documents that St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch released Monday with little explanation.  Other documents include transcripts of eight federal interviews of possible witnesses to Brown\\'s shooting in early August; police radio traffic; and an alleged audio recording of the shots fired by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.  The feds asked one of Mike Brown’s best friends to name their dealer https://t.co/lVmD4fkWeE #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/JaTjFvTx0J — Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) December 9, 2014  Many of the documents contained information that was similar or identical to the materials that McCulloch released on Nov. 24 after a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in Brown\\'s death. A transcript of testimony from an Air Force pathologist who performed the Justice Department autopsy was included in the November documents, but the autopsy report itself was not released until Monday. The transcripts of the witness interviews that were released Monday were already included in previously released testimony heard by the grand jury. The Justice Department autopsy found that Brown died from multiple gunshot wounds and had severe head and chest injuries, though it noted that the chest injury might have been an exit wound from a shot that entered Brown\\'s arm. The autopsy also found a minor gunshot wound to Brown\\'s right hand was evidence of close range discharge of a firearm. The full report can be viewed below: Doj Medical Examiner  Wilson told the local grand jury that his gun went off during a tussle with Brown through the open window of his police car moments before Brown was fatally shot. The Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation into Brown\\'s death. The Associated Press has reviewed all of the grand jury documents that have been released and none appear to include a transcript or a recording of a two-hour FBI and county police interview with Brown\\'s friend, Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown when he was shot. However, the first batch of documents did include seven video clips of Johnson\\'s media interviews, as well as a transcript of his testimony to the grand jury. Johnson was walking with Brown when they encountered Wilson in a Ferguson street. Wilson fatally shot Brown, who was unarmed, after a struggle. Johnson painted Wilson as provoking the violence, while Wilson said Brown was the aggressor. He also said Wilson fired at least one shot at his friend while Brown was running away. The transcript released in November notes that jurors listened to a recording of an Aug. 13 interview of Johnson by the federal and county investigators. Ed Magee, a spokesman for McCulloch, acknowledged earlier Monday that his office didn\\'t release copies of FBI interviews with some witnesses at the request of the Justice Department. An FBI spokeswoman in St. Louis declined comment. \"Those reports are not ours to release,\" Magee said. Hours later, Magee advised reporters that \"as promised, additional information concerning the grand jury testimony on the Michael Brown/Darren Wilson investigation is now ready to be released.\" Grand jury investigations are closed to the public. When McCulloch released documents last month, he said that he wanted transparency and believed \"everyone will be able to examine that same evidence and come to their own conclusion.\" Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department in late November.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' SYDNEY — Netflix, the American on-demand television and movie streaming service, is growing its audience in Australia without even launching in the local market. At the end of June, Village Roadshow confirmed Netflix was finally hitting our shores, although the company are yet to confirm a launch date. Impatient Aussies have already been getting in on the action - with Netflix growing steadily in popularity compared to local offerings over the last year and a half. See also: It\\'s Season Finale Time; Here\\'s What to Binge-Watch Next A new study by personal finance site Pocketbook found Netflix is the second most popular paid-content media company in Australia, despite not being available here and actively geo-blocking Australian users.   The graph is based on the number of users (popularity) as opposed to dollars spent (revenue).Image:  PocketbookThis could be a worry for the local rivals such as Foxtel, Ezyflix and Quickflix who have attempted to fill the gap in the market as it rapidly developed since the introduction of smart TVs.  With the internet feeding us information as we deserve it, it is a hard call to make Australian users wait for what content the rest of the world is already watching and if the statistics are to be believed, it appears the audience is fighting back by looking past local offerings. The data shows 27% of Australians using media or rental subscriptions are using Netflix, with the company\\'s users tripling in size since January 2013. They are using the service by \"tunnelling\" with a work-around VPN to avoid geo-blocking. Australians no longer want to live on their own special schedule, when they know having the content on their home television is only a small hurdle away. Although these statistics may be of some concern to the Australian market leader, Foxtel, the growth of Netflix has not come at its expense. Instead, traditional means of renting media have fallen — such as video rental stores — and local offering QuickFlix is losing to the international player.  Piracy in Australia is blamed on delayed release schedules.Image: NetflixAlthough Netflix is growing in popularity in Australia, this does not necessarily mean they are growing in revenue from Australian members. Foxtel charges $100 a month for their service, while Netflix scrapes in $10 a month from users. Quickflix are also still growing their user base rapidly, just not at the rate of Netflix. A common line of reasoning behind the high piracy rates in Australia has always been the absence of a company which gives decent access to U.S. TV shows and movies as they go to air. Netflix has found that hole in the market: many Australians want to pay to watch U.S. shows legally and by accessing Netflix through a tunneling service, they can do that. Without any marketing or formal servicing channel, Netflix is already changing the Australian marketplace from abroad. These figures are a sign more Australians will soon be watching television how they want it and when they want it. ',\n",

The Guinness World Records 2014: Gamer’s Edition just published, and it proves that gamers kept busy in 2013. From mind-bogglingly quick gameplay to the absolute hardest achievements in gaming, it was a year of impressive virtual feats. See also: The 8 Most Common Video Game Characters Here are 10 of our favorite gaming records from the past year. Do you think you have what it takes to beat them? 1. Largest Collection of Video Games If you have a buddy who loves to \"borrow\" your games and never return them, introduce him to Michael Thomasson. The Buffalo, N.Y., native’s game library houses 10,607 titles for 104 different systems. Thomasson estimates that the million-dollar collection, some of which he admits he hasn’t played yet, cost him less than $5,000.  Image: Guinness World Records 2. Fastest Call of Duty: Black Ops II Flag Capture As part of YouTube’s 2013 \"Geek Week,\" gamers Roc “Outconsumer” Massaguer and Alistair “Ali-A” Aiken set a new world record — by capturing the flag in Call of Duty: Black Ops II\\'s overflow map in one minute and 52 seconds. The most impressive part of the feat? Massaguer did it all blindfolded, with Aiken shouting directions to him. 3. Largest Gaming Tournament The 2013 FIFA Interactive World Cup holds the record for the largest gaming tournament, drawing in 2.5 million participants, with only 21 finalists advancing to Madrid, Spain to compete for the title. Last year’s winner was Bruce Grannec from France, earning his second title following a prior victory in 2009.  4. First Official Fan Convention for a Video Game Character The Summer of Sonic Convention has grown rapidly since its inception in 2008, with the 2012 convention selling all 400 tickets in just three minutes. Fans of the blue hedgehog can attend this year’s convention in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. 5. Longest Marathon With a Dance Video Game Here’s something to shame you into keeping that “stay in shape” 2014 resolution: Carrie Swidecki from Bakersfield, Calif., played Just Dance 4 for 49 hours, three minutes and 22 seconds. In case that didn’t hit you right away, that’s almost 50 straight hours of dancing. As in, more than two whole days. Let’s all take a moment to imagine that cardio workout.  Image: Ryan Schude, Guinness World Records 6. Best–Selling Video Game The best-selling video game of all time isn\\'t the latest COD or GTA — it’s Wii Sports. The family friendly title came bundled with the Wii console and sold over 81 million copies as of August 2013. Wii also holds the best-selling sports game title (excluding bundled titles such as Wii Sports) with Wii Fit, which has sold 22.75 million copies.  7. Most People Playing Angry Birds  Sure, a lot of people enjoy the mobile game, but do you like it enough to travel to Malaysia to play one level? That\\'s what 2,030 people did. The event, organized by Malaysia’s Nokia branch, saw 10 hours of continuous gameplay, with each participant playing one level only.  8. Fastest Completion of Batman: Arkham City  Gamelengths.com lists the average game time for the latest installment in the Batman series as 23 hours. But Sean “DarthKnight” Grayson doesn\\'t consider himself an average player. His fastest play-through of the game was a mere two hours, three minutes and 19 seconds. Image: Ryan Schude/Guinness World Records 9. First Video Game in Space The Russians beat us to this one, too. The first game in space was the Game Boy version of Tetris, packed by Cosmonaut Aleksander A. Sererbrov for his trip to the MIR Space Station. Serebov’s copy of the game sold for $1,220 in 2011.  10. Rarest Achievement in Portal 2  PC users had an extra challenge with Portal 2\\'s “Talent Show” achievement, which has been labeled as the most difficult achievement to gain in the beloved puzzle game. Co-op players must complete the sixth chamber of the Mobility Gels co-op course without dropping a single cube. Only 1.5% of Portal 2 PC gamers had accomplished the feat as of June 2013.

       " '  If your car was powered by thorium, you would never need to refuel it. The vehicle would burn out long before the chemical did. The thorium would last so long, in fact, it would probably outlive you. That\\'s why a company called Laser Power Systems has created a concept for a thorium-powered car engine. The element is radioactive, and the team uses bits of it to build a laserbeam that heats water, produces steam, and powers an energy-producing turbine.  Thorium is one of the most dense materials on the planet. A small sample of it packs 20 million times more energy than a similarly-sized sample of coal, making it an ideal energy source. See also: Scientists Use Lego Technology to Make More Efficient Solar Panels The thing is, Dr. Charles Stevens, the CEO of Laser Power Systems, told Mashable that thorium engines won\\'t be in cars anytime soon. \"Cars are not our primary interest,\" Stevens said.\\xa0\"The automakers don\\'t want to buy them.\" He said too much of the automobile industry is focused on making money off of gas engines, and it will take at least a couple decades for thorium technology to be used enough in other industries that vehicle manufacturers will begin to consider revamping the way they think about engines. \"We\\'re building this to power the rest of the world,\" Stevens said. He believes a thorium turbine about the size of an air conditioning unit could more provide cheap power for whole restaurants, hotels, office buildings, even small towns in areas of the world without electricity. At some point, thorium could power individual homes. Stevens understands that people may be wary of Thorium because it is radioactive — but any such worry would be unfounded. \"The radiation that we develop off of one of these things can be shielded by a single sheet off of aluminum foil,\" Stevens said.\"\\xa0\"You will get more radiation from one of those dental X-rays than this.\" Image: Flickr, Gordon McDowell ',\n",

Launched on October 25, 2001, Windows XP is one of the most successful Microsoft products ever; its successor, Windows Vista, was quickly replaced with Windows 7, and it took as long as September 2012 for Windows 7 to overtake XP as the most popular desktop operating system.  Microsoft released three Service Packs for Windows XP; the last one, SP3, was launched in May 2008. In April 2009, Microsoft ended Mainstream Support for the OS, meaning it stopped providing free technical support and accepting warranty claims. Up until today, the company provided Extended Support, which included paid technical support and security updates.  What does it mean for the end user? Simply put, you can continue to use Windows XP and Office 2003, but as time goes on, they will be more and more vulnerable to malware and other security risks.

       " ' This question originally appeared on Quora. What reply does the interviewer expect when he asks, \"Do you have any questions for us?\" I am a penultimate-year student and will be appearing for my interviews very soon. How should one tackle such questions? Answer by Ambra Benjamin, engineering recruiter at Facebook, previously LivingSocial, Google and Expedia. I think it\\'s important to note both now and throughout your entire career that when you interview for a job, you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you. Having well thought-out questions to ask during your interview is part of the research process, and helps increase your understanding of if this company and role is a good fit for you. I can think of a few times in my career that I completed my interview with a company and thought, \"This is not going to be a good fit,\" and completely withdrew my name. See also: 8 Things Recruiters Notice About Your Resume at First Glance (and 4 Things That Don\\'t Matter) I presume that in preparation for your interview you will do a lot of research on the industry, the position, the company, and if you\\'re able, even the person with whom you are meeting. While some people are able to think on their feet and come up with questions during the interview itself, it\\'s highly advisable that you come with two or three pre-prepared questions for your interviewer. This shows diligence, preparation and seriousness. Only you know what you want out of a job, but here are a few questions I\\'d suggest you ask a potential employer.  \"What does success in this role look like to you?\" or, \"How will success in this role be measured?\" \"Why did you join this company, and what keeps you here?\" \"What\\'s your favorite and least favorite thing about working here?\" \"What are the biggest challenges for the person who takes on this role?\" \"What are this company\\'s top three priorities over the next year?  Answer below by Corrie Hausman, HR specialist and recruiter. Ask questions that show you have really thought about the job/company. These could be questions about the duties, the best parts of the job/company/culture, the funding stream, the direction in which the business is headed, etc. These types of questions are great because they allow you to demonstrate in an informal and natural way that you\\'ve researched the company in advance.  Ask questions that show that you\\'ve been attentively listening and processing what the interviewer has said. Ask the interviewer how long he or she has been at the company, and what he or she likes best. This is flattering to the interviewer, and — even more importantly — you may learn things about the company culture that you\\'d never hear otherwise. Ask what the next steps are (if you haven\\'t already been told, of course). Ask when you will hear from the company again. Ask who will be contacting you, and if it will be by email or phone. Ask when the next round of interviews will be, and who will be conducting them. You have every right to want to know these details, and interviewers sometimes forget to tell you. Finally, don\\'t ask about information that you should already know from the job listing.  More Q&A on Quora: the best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from the experts and get insider knowledge.  What are the most common mistakes that candidates make in job interviews that cost them offers? How can these be avoided?

       " '     The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a boatload of features, but is extra durability one of them? Its predecessor, the Galaxy S III, lost a few drop tests to its chief rival, Apple\\'s iPhone 5. How will the brand-new flagship do? Someone decided to find out. Dropping the GS4 and iPhone 5 from various heights onto concrete, a gentleman from TechSmartt recorded his extensive test from three different cameras: One trained on him, a GoPro cam on the ground for capturing the impacts, and each phone\\'s own camera. So how did they do? As expected, both phones successfully endured drops from pocket and chest height with minor scuffs. Things got interesting when they fell from over-the-head height and above, however. Falling from a seven-foot drop, the Galaxy S4 began to show its limits. After hitting the ground on a corner edge, a spiderweb crack appeared on the screen. It didn\\'t cover the whole screen and the phone continued to function, but it was much more damage than the iPhone 5 exhibited after an identical drop, which again had only minor scuffs. SEE ALSO: BlackBerry Z10 Fails Sidewalk Drop Test  The iPhone 5 scored a knockout punch after both phones were subjected to 10-foot drops. The GS4 had to throw in the towel with an almost completely shattered screen and broken camera — the phone also stopped working shortly after the fall. The iPhone, on the other hand, once again survived with relatively minor damage — just the aforementioned scuffs and a small notch on the top right of the screen. Exploring what it would take to seriously damage the iPhone, the tester then dropped the iPhone 5 again, this time face first, but it still came out okay. Finally, he drove over the phone at slow speed with his car, but again the phone came out unshattered and functional. The video creator, Matthew Jones, says in the video\\'s notes that he produced the video without bias, examining only how each phone holds up to \"physical abuse.\" Both phones were \"bare naked,\" with no screen protectors, he wrote. The Galaxy S4 may be less durable than the iPhone 5, but from the test it appears to hold up to punishment better than the Galaxy S III, whose screen would often shatter when dropped on concrete from ear height or higher. How much do drop tests and durability matter to you when buying a new phone? Let us know in the comments.

       " \" After wearing the Jawbone UP for two months, entrepreneur Luke Sherwin says his quest to find out whether exercise during the day affected sleep at night was inconclusive. Tracking movement was not enough. But as one of the cofounders of Casper, a digitally-savvy mattress company, optimizing sleep is high on his priority list when it comes to trying new connected gadgets.  See also: Peek Inside This Entrepreneur's Zen Home His team is looking into a sleep tracker released at CES this year that measures heart rate and other variables beyond of movement, as well as outside factors that can be controlled in one's home, such as lighting and temperature. In his own space, the digital lives alongside what Luke calls an anti-minimalist aesthetic in his Brooklyn apartment. Mashable dropped by Luke's apartment to see how he's becoming more connected, during both waking and sleeping hours. Q&A With Luke Sherwin, Creative Director and Cofounder of Casper  Image:  Mashable,  Will FenstermakerHow did Casper start out? We discussed why there isn't a single mattress co that we care about or that resonates with us. What if we got something to resonate in a similar way that other brands are doing online in typically boring industries such as razorblades?  We came together with the idea, and pitched it after another investor meeting and the investor was like, oh thats a crazy good idea, can you put us in touch with the person doing it, and none of us were doing it, so we talked about it a little bit more and slowly Casper started to come to life. How would you define your neighborhood, and what appeals to you about your space? This is technically Prospect Heights, it's on the border of Park Slope. I'm right next to the 7th Avenue Q and B trains, so I can get anywhere in Manhattan in 15 minutes. It's nice because we're slightly elevated on a hill so if you go on the roof of this building, there's not another high structure looking toward the Statue of Liberty, so you see church steeples interspersed with other buildings across three miles in that direction.  Image:  Mashable,  Will Fenstermaker Image:  Mashable,  Will FenstermakerWhat do you show off first when people come over? It would be some site or project on Creative Suite on the iMac. I invested in a 27-inch screen iMac, and a lot of it is just for displaying things that I am proud of. How do you discover new home products, and what features or aesthetics are you looking for? Uncrate, product reviews on Mashable and on Gizmodo sometimes. Kickstarter is a massive one, but I've been disillusioned lately with the lead times. Walk us through a typical day. I wake up at 6:45 a.m. and spend an hour at my computer catching up on emails. I often make lemonade (it's my morning thing). I bike over the manhattan bridge to NoHo about 10% of the time right now, or I just get the B or the Q train to work. Then I'm in and out of NoHo for meetings, and sometimes at our creative agency in DUMBO, until 9:30 at night when I come back home, often for a drink with my roommates on the roof.  Image:  Mashable,  Will FenstermakerHow do you describe your personal style, when it comes to your home. I definitely like to mix early 20th century art that one can buy for very little from sites like liveauctioneers.com. When everyone else is getting contemporary prints I can get the original paintings, so I like to mix that with things like a massive iMac.  Image:  Mashable,  Will Fenstermaker Image:  Mashable,  Will FenstermakerDo you see your home getting more connected? What's next for you? For me, the interesting part of connected is quantified self. You learn things over a very short period of time and then you can wait for another aspect of your life you want to learn about. There's a lot of cool sleep tracking technology that was released at CES this year so we're testing a bed sleep tracker that measures all kinds of things — like heart rate — that none of these movement oriented apps do.

       " ' To be a female football fan is an uneasy bargain. Often women can participate in the camaraderie with little thought to gender, politics or power. Other times the National Football League makes a controversial decision that forces women to question their loyalty. The latest example? It punished Ray Rice, a Baltimore Ravens player accused of domestic violence, with a two-day game suspension. Last February, police arrested the talented and well-liked Baltimore Ravens running back for assaulting his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City  casino elevator. Rice, 27, allegedly punched and knocked out Janay Palmer during an altercation; she was also arrested. Rice pleaded not-guilty and his wife did not want to pursue the case. But a surveillance camera recorded the aftermath — Rice trying to move her limp body into the hallway, standing over her as she lay facedown on the floor.  See also: Sports Media Misogyny: What Is Fans\\' Problem With Female Commentators? It\\'s an agonizing scene, and many predicted the NFL would harshly sanction Rice, particularly since the league has worked hard to transform its female fans into fanatics. But when the league recently delivered Rice\\'s punishment — the two-game suspension at the cost of a half million dollars — it sparked a weeklong outcry.  It sent a message to fans, particularly women, about the NFL\\'s priorities and values — and it was far from pretty.   Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, second from left, speaks with team president Dick Cass, left, owner Steve Bisciotti, second from right, and Kevin Byrne, senior vice president for public and community relations, after a training camp practice, Thursday, July 24, 2014, at the team\\'s practice facility in Owings Mills, Maryland.Image: AP Photo/Associated PressWhile the NFL and the Ravens may see Rice as a good-hearted friend and brother who made a terrible decision, women who watch football are wondering what the lenient sentence says about their place in the league.  The NFL has increasingly come to see women as more than a niche audience. They account for 40% of all fans, a third of the crowd at games, and nearly half of the consumers who purchase licensed apparel, according to Experian Marketing Services. Women are arguably more valuable during the Super Bowl, when the viewing audience becomes almost evenly split between women and men, according to Nielsen.  In recent years, the NFL has catered to these customers with products designed for them, including fitted jerseys in team colors — not just a shade of pink. It also launched a savvy marketing campaign during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which includes a screening and fundraising campaign.   The statistics alone should call for special attention to Rice\\'s penalty. Yet, the Ravens actively supported Rice following the suspension, publishing a piece about the quality of his character and a post about how fans gave him a standing ovation at a recent practice. The latter acknowledged Rice has \"been in the court of public opinion,\" but did not identify why. All this after the the team posted a widely criticized tweet in May noting that Rice\\'s wife, who admitted to striking Rice, \"deeply regrets\" her role in the assault.  The Ravens\\' PR strategy proved boorish.  Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident. — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) May 23, 2014  On Friday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell publicly addressed the criticism around Rice\\'s suspension, unequivocally condemning the athlete\\'s behavior. \"We have a very firm policy that domestic violence is not acceptable in the NFL and that there will be consequences for that,\" he said. But he also empathized with Rice: \"He recognizes he made a horrible mistake, that it is unacceptable, by his standards and by our standards. And he’s got to work to re-establish himself.\"  Coming from the NFL, a multi-billion dollar organization known for bungling past accusations against players involving abuse and assault, the tender treatment of Rice felt tone-deaf.  Last year a reported 21 of 32 NFL team rosters had a player previously charged with domestic or sexual violence, according to an analysis of data collected by the San Diego Union-Tribune. Data journalism website FiveThirtyEight found that while domestic violence arrests in the NFL are lower than the national average, they still account for 48% of all arrests for violent crimes in the league.  Observers pointed out that players who use drugs routinely receive stricter discipline than Rice did. Last year, for example, the NFL suspended Jacksonville wide receiver Justin Blackmon for four games without pay after he violated the league\\'s substance abuse policy. Commissioner Goodell explained on Friday that the substance abuse policy is dictated by a collective bargaining agreement, whereas other violations are not.  \"We have dealt with it in a serious manner, and we’re very confident that this young man understands where he is and what he needs to do going forward,\" he said of Rice\\'s case. The NFL would not comment further when asked by Mashable about whether or not Rice\\'s controversial punishment has any bearing on its female fans and their relationship with the league. The Baltimore Ravens also declined to comment on the matter. A poll conducted by Huffington Post and YouGov indicates a more stringent penalty would have been well-received by the American public. Of the 1,000 respondents, nearly a quarter said assaulting a partner should result in a lifetime ban from the NFL, and almost a third endorsed a season-long suspension. Indeed, the NFL and the Ravens may be blinded by their personal admiration of and relationship with Rice, who has spoken out against bullying and appeared remorseful in a press conference on Thursday. Though Rice was not tried in court, he was placed in a diversionary program and is receiving counseling.  Jacob Simpson, a 29-year-old Baltimore native and Ravens fan, wrote an impassioned op-ed for the Baltimore Sun decrying how both the NFL and the team handled Rice\\'s sanction. A pastor and self-described \"advocate against domestic violence and rape culture,\" Simpson told Mashable that while Rice may genuinely be a good person who made an awful choice, now is not the time to talk at length about his redemption.  \"They are promoting him like he’s a fallen hero who needs to lifted up,\" Simpson said. \"If the Ravens wanted to do something about this [they could] put a story up there that a survivor is willing to share. They could make an effort to change the conversation for the better instead of circling the wagons and trying to plug the proverbial leaks.\" It\\'s not clear yet whether female fans are satisfied with the NFL\\'s response or if some will turn on the league. The Ravens have the fourth largest local fan base in the country, according to Nielsen, and it\\'s possible they will forgive Rice and forget, regardless of dissenters like Simpson.  On a Facebook page for \"Purple Ladies,\" a Ravens\\' fan group for women with more than 30,000 \"likes,\" Rice\\'s name hadn\\'t come up all week. The conversation on the team\\'s official Facebook page, though, quickly became heated; at least one woman said she\\'d never watch a game in which Rice played while another said his punishment was sufficient. What they\\'ll all be watching, to be sure, is how the NFL disciplines the next player accused of abusing a woman.

Mascot on Rollerblades Fail What happens when you put an inflatable dinosaur on rollerblades and ask it to skate down a flight of stairs? Amazingness, that\\'s what.          4. Flopping Fail In sports, to \"flop\" is to exaggerate the force of contact in hopes of drawing a favorable call from officials. But you\\'ve got to time it much, much better than this guy does.          5. Hockey Celebration Fail Apparently, if you hug a member of the opposite team after scoring a goal in hockey, you will get punched in the face.          6. Innocent Bystander Fail This kid is just in the wrong place at the wrong time...to the benefit of the rest of us.          7. Representing Your School Fail  College football mascots are supposed to represent their schools in a fun, positive light — which doesn\\'t typically include picking fights. Here, the University of Oregon\\'s duck slams the University of Houston\\'s cougar. Bonus points for the sick elbow drop, though.           8. Weightlifting Fail  Not saying we could successfully lift 432 pounds above our heads, but dang, that looks painful.

Paying Attention Fail After what could best be described as an \"optimistic\" shot attempt in a game last season, NBA center JaVale McGee showed some nice hustle getting back on defense. Only problem? His team still had the ball.          12. Judgment Fail But that wasn\\'t McGee\\'s only legendary moment. Here, he shows why it\\'s not a good idea to try dunking from the free throw line mid-game.          13. Olympic Promo Fail  For some reason, London\\'s Olympic promotions this summer involved hanging Mayor Boris Johnson on a zipline while waving a pair of tiny flags. Then he got stuck halfway through and it was pretty much the best, funniest, awkwardest thing that could have happened.           14. Grand Slam Celebration Fail Major Leaguer Kendry Morales broke his lower left leg while celebrating a game-winning grand slam in 2010. This edited video provides the before, during and after rundown.          15. Slam Dunk Fail See? White guys can jump? It\\'s just the landing that\\'s the hard part.          16. High Dive Fail The announcer here sums it up perfectly. She calls this attempt from the 1992 Olympics \"an absolute failed dive.\"          17. Piggyback Ride Fail What begins as an innocent enough piggyback ride atop a fuzzy mascot turns into a pretty epic collision — and YouTube gold.          18. Long Jump Fail Dude! If you\\'re gonna pump up the crowd like that, you can\\'t just faceplant into the sand.          19. Touchdown Celebration Fail When you think about it, is there any better way to celebrate a touchdown than by pegging an unsuspecting spectator in the face? Bonus points for originality, at least.          20. Pro Golfer Fail You\\'d think a professional golfer could put the ball in the hole with less than 16 strokes. Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open.          21. Head-First Slide Fail Well, that\\'s one way of doing it...right?          22. Time Management Fail  Tie game, clock winding down — it\\'s always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. This classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut\\'s Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011.           23. Boogie Boarding Fail Its veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack.          24. Sportsmanship Fail  The summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. So it makes perfect sense that he\\'d let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That\\'s what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video.           25.

       " '    Microsoft Surface 2 Hands On        The Surface Evolves The Surface 2 takes the original Surface RT idea and upgrades it with a better display, a faster processor and a more versatile kickstand. It goes on sale Oct. 22 for $449.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Kickstand, High Position The kickstand can still prop the tablet up at the \"ideal\" angle of 22 degrees.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Kickstand, Low Position If you\\'re tall, you\\'ll appreciate that the kickstand can go a little further down when necessary.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Compared with Surface RT The Surface 2 (top) has a full HD (1,920 x 1,080) screen while the Surface RT\\'s is 1,366 x 768.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Side View The new Surface looks very similar to the old one from the side.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         SD Card Slot Moves The SD card slot moves a little bit down.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         New Camera The Surface 2\\'s camera is improved (note the new holes for sensors/microphones).  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Altered Bevel The edge of the Surface 2 no longer has a beveled edge on the display side.  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani         Side Ports Compared with the original Surface RT (left).  Image:  Mashable, Christina Ascani       The Surface 2 is a pretty tablet. With its new light-gray finish, the second-generation Surface at least looks the part of a premium tablet. But does it make a more convincing case as an iPad or Android alternative? Microsoft would bristle at the Surface 2 being labeled an \"iPad alternative.\" In the company\\'s narrative, the Surface 2 is its own category: a tablet that also serves as a versatile PC when it needs to — something tablets on other ecosystems don\\'t do. See also: The Problem With Windows 8 That\\'s only kind of half-true since the Surface 2 won\\'t run older Windows apps, but it\\'s certainly a well-designed tablet. It\\'s even lighter than the first model, and when you fold up the attached Touch/Type Cover, it\\'s a natural to tuck it under your arm.  Feeling Good The biggest physical change to the Surface exterior, however, is the new kickstand. Previously limited to just one angle, which made it harder to use for taller users, the stand can now lean back further. It\\'s easy to switch between the angles, and the hinge feels very solid in either; it won\\'t suddenly become flatter just because you press the screen too hard. But check again two years from now. The biggest change internally is the device\\'s Nvidia Tegra 4 processor, a step up from the Tegra 3 in the original Surface RT. Using the device for a few minutes on Monday, I wasn\\'t impressed by any particular performance feat on the Surface 2, but it did a great job keeping up with me, as I sped through various tablet tasks. Launching apps was quick, web pages appeared in moments and the screen responded instantly to my finger when I, for example, drew a basic picture in Fresh Paint. Powered by Tegra 4, the Surface 2 easily makes the jump to a full HD screen, and it\\'s a beauty. Colors pop (even when viewed from the side), and although the display is glossy, there\\'s virtually no glare. Sliding your finger across it has just the right amount of friction — you really end up thinking, \"This is how a tablet is supposed to feel.\"  Microsoft says the new Touch Cover is equipped with many more sensors than the first one, giving it greater reliability and accuracy. I found that to be the case, responding well to key presses even when the keyboard was dangling. Two-finger gestures — a challenge for any trackpad — worked well on the Surface 2\\'s, letting me scroll horizontally through apps and the home screen easily.  Surface Perks Running the Windows RT version of Windows 8.1, the Surface 2 has some new software features, including tighter integration with SkyDrive (Microsoft\\'s cloud service), an enhanced Snap ability that lets two apps run on the screen simultaneously in different-sized windows and the full version of Office pre-loaded, among other things. SkyDrive is a big deal in Windows 8.1 and the new Surfaces. Microsoft is giving away a massive 200 GB of storage (for two years) with every Surface sold, enabling the company to control costs by keepings the device storage more or less the same. Windows 8.1 treats SkyDrive storage just like any other drive, and it has special technological tricks to make those files respond faster. I tried out the improved Snap on the Surface 2. For the 10.6-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 screen, all Windows would let me fit was two windows, but the sizes were flexible. I could position the separator bar anywhere from a 50-50 split to where the original Snap would default: about 75-25. The gestures to engage Snap are still a little awkward, but still works as advertised. And let\\'s not forget Office, which comes free on Windows RT devices, and now includes Outlook. This finally makes good on the promise of the original launch of the Surface and other RT devices — giving them the full version of Office — although it may be too late to make any difference. The Tablet/PC Conundrum The Surface 2 makes a good case to be your tablet. It\\'s fast, gorgeous and that 200 GB of SkyDrive storage (about $200 value) really sweetens the deal. It almost makes you forget that there are only 100,000 apps in the Windows Store (in comparison, the iOS App Store has 350,000 iPad-optimized apps). It\\'s also worth remembering that the Surface 2 doesn\\'t run older Windows apps. Even as many more apps start to appear in the Windows store, the smaller, plug-in-style apps don\\'t and probably never will. For anyone who likes to customize their PC with dozens of these little \"tweakers\" (I happen to be one of them), the Surface 2 is a tough sell. But the Surface isn\\'t looking to be your go-to PC. While it can do many of the things a PC can, the Surface primarily aims to be what you reach for specifically when you don\\'t want a PC. For your tablet needs, the Surface 2 definitely has the goods. Still, that\\'s not enough — the Surface 2 needs to show why it\\'s worth buying over an iPad. It\\'s a question that we\\'ll answer in our review. Stay tuned.  Images: Mashable, Christina Ascani ',\n",
       " ' An Antares rocket, one of two launchers developed with NASA backing to fly cargo capsules to the International Space Station, blasted off on its debut mission on Sunday, successfully depositing a dummy spacecraft into orbit. Launch from a new commercial spaceport on Wallops Islands, Virginia, had been delayed from last week by a technical problem and two days of bad weather. SEE ALSO: Private Rocket Ready for Critical Launch Test  By Sunday, the skies had cleared and the 13-story rocket — the biggest ever to fly from the Wallops Flight Facility — lifted off its seaside launch pad precisely at 5 p.m. EDT. An onboard camera showed the rocket riding a bright pillar of flame  as it hurtled over the Atlantic Ocean, heading toward an orbit 158 miles above Earth. With the 4-ton dummy Cygnus capsule safely deposited into orbit, the Orbital Sciences mission control team broke into cheers and applause. They will regroup for a second and final Antares test flight slated for late June or early July when a real Cygnus capsule will attempt to fly itself to the station. NASA hired Orbital Sciences and startup Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. SEE ALSO: Poor Weather Keeps Antares Rocket Grounded  SpaceX completed three test flights and last year began the first of 12 supply runs to the station under a $1.6 billion contract.  NASA also contributed $396 million toward development and testing of the company’s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon cargo capsule. Orbital has one more test flight under its $288 million development contract before it is clear to begin the first of eight planned cargo runs under a $1.9-billion NASA contract. (Orbital’s Cygnus capsule is larger and can carry more cargo than SpaceX’s Dragon, hence the price difference.) “It’s been a long slog,” NASA administrator Charlie Bolden told the Orbital Sciences launch team after the mission. “It’s absolutely incredible what this team has done.” NASA radioed the space station crew about the successful test flight. SEE ALSO: Astronaut Guide: How to Train Your Dragon  “Wahoo, that’s super, that’s great news,” said station commander Chris Hadfield. “Good for them. Congratulations to all concerned. That bodes well for all of our futures.” The dummy capsule is expected to remain in orbit for about two weeks before it will be pulled back into the atmosphere by Earth’s gravity and incinerate.

       " ' Some may have thought a $5,000 Apple Watch was a bit extravagant. That\\'s chump change compared to this. Mervis Diamond Importers is planning a diamond-encrusted Apple Watch that costs more than some cars: $30,150.  It\\'s not a real thing yet — the Apple Watch isn\\'t even available for purchase, and the designers are waiting to make sure that buyers are out there. Still, the extremely luxurious Apple product is up for preorder on Mervis\\' website, where the company released a concept image on Tuesday.  See also: Apple Watch\\'s high-priced fashion focus on the mark, study says There will probably be five to 10 limited edition models, Jonathan Mervis, a spokesman for the diamond retailer, told Mashable.  The product is in no way being pushed by Apple. Mervis is planning on decking out the Apple Watches on its own. That might seem a bit outrageous to some people — heck, even the $350 Apple Watch is steep for some of us. But that\\'s also sort of the point. \"Yes, diamonds are stunning and they’re also natural and eternal, but what really sets the price apart from other pretty things is rarity,\" Mervis said. \"Luxury shoppers want to know that they have something special.\" The watch is supposed to have eight rows of round diamonds. The concept image shows the rose gold model, but Mervis will also offer it in platinum or white gold; pricing may vary. This isn\\'t the company\\'s first attempt at blinging out an Apple product. Before the iPad launched, Mervis put a $20,000 diamond version up for sale.  The one interested buyer eventually backed out, so the obscenely expensive iPad never saw the light of day.

       " ' As cooler weather settles in and the season for sniffles and sore throats looms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention won\\'t be tracking the pattern of this year\\'s flu. The government shutdown has furloughed much of the CDC staff, and FluView, the department\\'s weekly Influenza surveillance reports, is frozen. See also: Space-Loving Twitter Users Cover for NASA During Shutdown In the shadow of the shutdown, a few online flu trackers — which usually serve as supplements to the CDC\\'s official reports — continue to monitor the illness when the agency cannot. Flu Near You, a health site that tracks the flu through user-submitted symptoms, has seen a 100% rise in activity, according to Clark Freifeld and John Brownstein, who cofounded HealthMap, the program that started Flu Near You.  Sickweather, an online social health network, has also seen an increase in use, founder Graham Dodge told Mashable. The website scans social media for public, geo-tagged posts that reveal illness. When someone posts \"I\\'m sick,\" Sickweather adds it to its map. A 2011 report from Johns Hopkins University suggested that illness trends pulled from Twitter and official CDC reports tracked nearly identical patterns. The only difference: Twitter\\'s results came about two weeks earlier since it tracks in real time without the delay of collection and qualification from an official agency.     But while alternative means of flu tracking exist, they are not a perfect substitute for the CDC, said Susan Polan, associate executive director of public affairs and advocacy at American Public Health Association.  APHA partnered with HealthMap to launch Flu Near You, and Polan helped the team develop the website. While she believes it\\'s a trustworthy service and a useful way to stay informed, she said it is not a replacement for the CDC\\'s weekly flu reports. \"Flu Near You is a great tool, but it doesn\\'t have the reach,\" she said.  With a strong national presence, the CDC has the capacity to uniformly survey nationwide. On the other hand, Flu Near You relies on self reporting, which could attract \"people predisposed to getting a flu shot,\" and people \"already thinking ahead about their health,\" she said, leading to a potentially biased sample.  Polan also emphasized that the CDC\\'s flu work isn\\'t just about tracking — it\\'s also about prevention of and solutions to outbreaks. \"They can focus on the next step,\" she said. \"They can quickly look at the situation and take action.\" While the CDC\\'s FluView has been sidelined during the shutdown, not all of the center has gone dark. Following a Monday public health alert from the USDA about the salmonella outbreak, the CDC allowed nearly a full staff of furloughed foodborne illness specialists to return to work Tuesday, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News. Additionally, many state and local health organizations are still up and running.  \"We continue to provide federally funded services including flu surveillance, vaccine distribution and HIV services,\" the New York City Health Department said in an emailed statement. The department said it won\\'t see an impact on its federally funded programs unless the shutdown continues into next year. Image: Flickr, Michael Verhoef ',\n",
       " '  Finding difficulty using that iPad or Kindle? Don\\'t worry, ladies. There\\'s finally an easy-to-use tablet just for us.  It\\'s called the ePad Femme, and the Middle East–based Eurostar Group, who developed the product, are describing it as the \"world\\'s first tablet made exclusively for women.\" It\\'s already going over about as well as the Bic \"Cristal for Her\" Ball Pen on Amazon. The eight-inch tablet comes preloaded with a pink background and a number of apps (so we don\\'t have to stress over the difficulty of doing it ourselves) that revolve around yoga, grocery shopping, weight loss and cooking, writes Ars Technica. If a 5-year-old can figure it out, we probably can too, right? It\\'s also Wi-Fi-accessible, runs on Android 4.0, and has 16GB of internal storage. But if we can\\'t download our own apps, we certainly don\\'t need to know what those numbers mean for the tablet or what we\\'re able to do with an SD card slot. The ePad Femme was first announced in October, but it was touted as a Valentine\\'s Day gift idea.  \"The Tablet comes preloaded with applications so you can just turn it on and log in to cooking recipes or yoga,\" Mani Nair, Associate Vice President for Marketing at Eurostar Group, told the Jerusalem Post. \"It makes a perfect gadget for a woman who might find difficulties in terms of downloading these applications and it is a quick reference.\" Nair insists that the ePad Femme isn\\'t sexist and explained that Eurostar Group is focusing on pre-loaded applications for many of their products. However, Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi feminist blogger, feels that this is just another way to give women information targeted at pleasing their husbands. She explained that many women are tech-savvy, and in countries like Saudi Arabia, women spend a lot of time online since they are not allowed to drive or travel without a male relative. \"Whoever made this tablet doesn\\'t understand us very well,\" Al Nafjan said. \"We are home all the time and we are extremely tech-savvy.\" The ePad Femme is going for about $190, and EUROSTAR had only sold about 7,000 units as of mid-February. Whether people want to go with an ePad or another tablet, there are plenty of other non-gender-specific options available that are a lot less polarizing. I\\'m sure we can figure it out on our own.

       " ' In the roughy 35 hours since a leaked video showed the world something everyone already knew happened — NFL star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancée in a casino elevator last February — the running back has been ditched by all his endorsement partners, most significantly Nike. The five-year, $35 million deal he signed in 2012 has been terminated by the Baltimore Ravens. The NFL has suspended him indefinitely. His now-wife Janay Rice has blasted media attention over her personal life with \"the man I love\" — and been roundly criticized for doing so by total strangers. See also: NFL Football Is Coming: The Good, the Bad and the Comedy Ray Rice is now a man without a country. The only question is: For how long? A quick look back through history shows that, time and again, talented athletes rebound from terrible scandals to go on earning millions — if they\\'re talented enough on the field, that is. So if he never sees an NFL locker room again — something many seem to gleefully hope is the case — don\\'t credit ethics or morals or lines in the sand. Blame the NFL\\'s image control and his declining production while running the football. Violent game, violent history  Ray Lewis is now an NFL analyst for ESPN. Image: David Goldman/Associated PressIn 2012, Rice won a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens and teammate Ray Lewis. Lewis was charged with murder in 2000 after he and a group of friends got in an altercation with another group. Two men from the other group were stabbed to death and blood from one of them was found in Lewis\\' limo. Lewis was one of the NFL\\'s biggest stars at the time. In a deal for reduced charges, he ended up testifying against two men he was with the night of the killings and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. The Ravens\\' AFC North division rivals are the Pittsburgh Steelers. They\\'re quarterbacked by Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger has won two Super Bowls and been accused of sexual assault twice. After the second accusation, he was suspended by the NFL for six games — a ban that was later reduced to four games. Roethlisberger was never arrested, nor was he formally charged after hiring the same lawyer who helped Lewis through his murder issue. Today Roethlisberger is still Pittsburgh\\'s starting quarterback. Back in 1996, Lawrence Phillips was picked sixth overall in the NFL Draft despite beating up a girlfriend and dragging her down three flights of stairs by her hair as she screamed, according to police. His college coach, Tom Osborne, described the incident in 1995: \"Lawrence and I have agreed on what happened and there\\'s no question, I wouldn\\'t call it a beating, but he certainly did inflict some damage to the young lady. She was dragged down some stairs and there were some injuries.\"  A.J. Jefferson plays for the Seattle Seahawks now. A.J. Jefferson was cut by the Minnesota Vikings last November after being arrested for allegedly strangling his girlfriend. Ten months later, he\\'s on the Seattle Seahawks. The list of football pros with checkered pasts goes on, including Michael Vick  and Josh Brent. The NFL isn\\'t always a league for good men; it\\'s a league for athletically talented men. Whether or not this is OK is a separate discussion, but that\\'s simply the way it is. It\\'s not just a football phenomenon either. Ron Artest came back to the NBA after brawling with fans in the stands. Floyd Mayweather is a megastar boxer with a long and troubling history of abusing women. Let\\'s even look at an example from from the NFL right now. Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers is a Pro Bowler who racked up 15 sacks last year. He was also convicted in July of assaulting and threatening his girlfriend. Two days ago, Hardy registered a sack and forced a fumble in the Panthers\\' first game of the season. A brave stand against (videotaped) domestic violence Hardy is appealing, so punishment may be yet to come, but Rice\\'s case never even went to trial. Yet there\\'s Hardy on the field, and here\\'s Rice banished to the hinterlands. What gives? Video. Rice\\'s assault was caught on tape. Even before the explosive footage of his actual hit was leaked Monday, a different video that didn\\'t show any punches — but did show him dragging his then-fiancée from the elevator — had been seared into fans\\' minds months ago. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was ripped for suspending Rice for just two games in July, so he imposed a formal set of domestic violence punishments for the league: Six games for a first offense, a lifetime ban for doing it twice. Which only makes Rice\\'s indefinite suspension for a first offense more confusing.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has not had a great last few weeks. Image:  Mashable,  Christina AscaniAgain: What gives? Again: Video. Leave it to The Onion to provide perhaps more clarity on the situation than any real press outlet. Its Tuesday headline: \"NFL Announces New Zero-Tolerance Policy On Videotaped Domestic Violence.\" “I can assure you that any member of this league who strikes a woman in front of a live camera will face swift and heavy consequences,\" The Onion fictitiously quotes Goodell as saying. \"I also want to stress that this utterly reprehensible behavior is something we will in no way tolerate as long as the footage is completely uninterrupted and the entirety of the assault takes place within frame.” Right or wrong, the video that emerged Monday changed everything for Rice, for Goodell and for the NFL. Rice landed one actual blow (that we know of), but it was caught on video. Can you imagine where Chris Brown would be now if his beating Rihanna\\'s face into a bruised mess back in 2009 had been caught on tape? Probably not on the cover of the latest issue of Billboard, that\\'s for sure. What Rice did was awful and there\\'s no question he deserved more than the initial two-game ban handed down by Goodell. But the visceral power of it being caught on video is remarkable. It\\'s what makes Rice \"radioactive,\" as one NFL general manager described him to Bleacher Report\\'s Mike Freeman this week. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said on Tuesday that he doesn\\'t think Rice \"will play another NFL game. I would be shocked if some team would pick him up.\" Have the NFL\\'s billionaire oligarchs suddenly found the fountain of righteous morality? Of course not. Hardy, Phillips, Lewis, Roethlisberger, Jefferson and any number of characters from the past and present prove this beyond a doubt. But, like that one general manager told Freeman, Rice\\'s public image — and that video — make him \"radioactive.\" If Goodell\\'s waffling on Rice\\'s suspension shows anything, it\\'s that the NFL is more image-conscious than ever. A comeback? The elephant in the room There\\'s another layer to the Rice saga that hasn\\'t gotten much attention: It\\'s much more convenient for him to be \"radioactive\" now than it would have been four years ago.  Image: GoogleBack in 2009, you see, Rice averaged 5.3 yards per carry. That\\'s about as good as it gets in the NFL. In 2011, he averaged 4.7 yards per carry and racked up 12 touchdowns to boot. Last year? Rice carried the ball fewer times than any season since his rookie year and averaged a lowly 3.1 yards each time he did so, ranking just 45th in the NFL among regular rushers. He\\'s also 27 years old — the exact age at which research shows NFL running backs\\' production falls off a cliff. If this was 2009 and Rice was 23 years old averaging a gaudy 5.3 yards per rush, we\\'re having a much different conversation about whether he makes it back to the NFL — video or no video. Just 3.1 yards per carry? Talk about radioactive. \"I mean, from a production standpoint, [Rice] really wasn\\'t doing much recently anyway,\" one Ravens fan told USA Today on Monday.  Ray Rice, in happier times, celebrates winning Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens on Feb. 3, 2013. Image: Matt Slocum/Associated PressRice\\'s indefinite suspension from the league means by definition he can be reinstated. Who knows — maybe he will be, and maybe some team will take a chance on him. Like the Seahawks with Jefferson, or the Panthers with Hardy, or so many other teams with so many other players over the years. Goodell already laid the first groundwork for a comeback in his Tuesday night interview with CBS. \"I don\\'t rule that out,\" he said of Rice re-entering the league, \"but he would have to make sure that we are fully confident that he is addressing this issue clearly.\" Does Rice even deserve a lifetime ban? Many think so, but according to the NFL\\'s new rules that Rice himself catalyzed, he doesn\\'t. If Rice never makes it back, don\\'t credit some righteous moral stance from the league. Blame billionaire owners who don\\'t want to ruffle the feathers of monied fans and a league that\\'s happy to discard a running back entering the distinct downside of his career. Of course, looking at the bigger picture, perhaps it\\'s time to break this habit of looking at pro sports as some sort of national moral arbiter. To expect much more than crass public relations worries and cold-blooded bottom-line calculations is simply naive.

       " ' AUSTIN, Texas — Mason Endres hugs a plush toy and closes her eyes Saturday in a hospital bed, days after an intoxicated driver crashed through barricades and struck her and others while fleeing police during South by Southwest. The bruised and broken 18-year-old hears music that isn\\'t coming from a radio, television or laptop. It\\'s live from her bedside courtesy of Jared & The Mill — one of her favorite bands.  See also: 2 Dead, 23 Injured After Car Runs Through Crowd at SXSW She requests \"Just for Now,\" a ballad with emotional lyrics: \"But for the record, you reminded me, reminded me that I\\'m not here alone ...\" The Phoenix-based band, in Austin for SXSW, visited Endres at St. David’s Medical Center to give her a private concert, since she couldn\\'t physically attend the band\\'s SXSW show on Friday. She\\'s recovering from a broken nose and leg as well as a fractured neck.   \"We played the songs she wanted to hear,\" the band\\'s singer, Jared Kolesar, 23, told Mashable. \"It was a very heavy feeling in the room because of everything she has been through — heavy and inspiring. Her parents were really emotional. She\\'s just as much our friend as she is our fan. \" Kolesar met Endres at SXSW in 2013 when the band was performing on the street. They mingled then and have been in contact ever since. When the band played in Austin in September, Endres attended the show with friends.  Kolesar was down the road early Thursday morning when the crash happened downtown on Red River Street, so he quickly heard that the incident ended with two people dead and 23 others injured.  Endres\\' friends alerted the band to her injuries, and the band immediately decided to play a set for her at the hospital.  \"It\\'s always very humbling to see the effect your music has on the people who love it,\" he said. \"She\\'s doing good. She had to go into surgery a few times, but she\\'s in pretty good spirits. She\\'s on the road to a speedy recovery and we\\'re very thankful for that.\"           How good are her spirits? Well, she did take a selfie (pictured, below) Friday, with the caption, \"Still killing that selfie game hospital style ya\\'ll.\"  Mason Endres, 18, took this selfie in her hospital bed and posted it to Twitter on Friday, a day after the South by Southwest crash. Image: Mason EndresThe band played \"Just for Now,\" \"Love to Be Found,\" \"Ides of Fall\" and \"Western Expansion,\" all of which you can listen to below:  The Austin Police Department confirmed to Mashable that the driver at fault was 21-year-old Rashad Charjuan Owens from Killeen, Texas, who was previously charged with driving under the influence in 2011.  A man and a woman, riding on a bike and a moped, respectively, were killed when Owens\\' vehicle struck them at 11th and Red River streets.  ',\n",
       " ' Email is not sexy. That is to say, the design and functionality of electronic mail, since its inception, have remained fundamentally consistent and relatively unexciting— we type out messages, send them to our contacts and wait for a reply. In 10 years, that foundation will still exist, but we\\'ll likely have a lot more options. See also: 10 Chain Emails That Haunted Your Youth According to experts, such as Yesware founder Matthew Bellows, the time for email to expand and innovate is now. \"There was an idea that email was dead a few years ago,\" Bellows tells Mashable. \"That\\'s just not true, obviously.\" Though competing messaging platforms and other options have come and gone, email has remained perhaps the primary use of the Internet since it began. When Gmail entered the mix 10 years ago, the seeds of evolution were planted. Now, email seems due for another great change. We reached out to developers and designers like Bellows to see what those changes will look like, and how they\\'ll affect the way we send and receive email.  1. The dawn of third-party applications Currently, most major email providers do not expressly support third-party applications. This makes it challenging for other companies, beyond the provider, to increase the usefulness of email as a whole for users with niche needs. For Bellows and the team at Yesware, whose tool is built on top of preexisting email providers to allow users simpler solutions to common business problems, this fact makes it difficult to grow. \"We\\'re kind of hacked in right now,\" Bellows says. \"Every time Gmail changes, we have to change.\" According to Bellows, email providers would be wise to encourage more and easier third-party programming. He believes that when Facebook launched its \"Facebook Platform\" for third-party development in 2007, the value of its service exploded. Users could go to Facebook for niche interests such as gaming, and all Facebook had to do was open the door. Users stayed on Facebook longer, third-party developers had an easier time reaching customers and your over-sharing aunt was able to play Farmville to her heart\\'s content.   The Email Game - Conquer your Email from Baydin Inc. on Vimeo. In 10 years, Bellows sees third-party development exploding on email services like Gmail. \"I don\\'t think [Gmail is] against it, I think it\\'s a matter of priority for them,\" says Bellows. \"I think it says something that in the meantime, they haven\\'t shut us down.\" Gmail Product Manager Alex Gawley doesn\\'t disagree with Bellows prediction, but sees third-party development happening in different ways. \"It\\'s less about third-party devs building on top of Gmail than building within the emails that they send,\" Gawley tells Mashable. To him, the future will be about senders putting richer information within emails — package tracking data, surveys, etc. — rather than building apps to improve the service itself.  2. Smarter input, history and management \"What\\'s going to be constant is this: We will be sending each other electronic messages and we will have way too many of them,\" Bellows says. According to him, the usefulness of speech recognition tools such as the iPhone\\'s Siri have yet to be fully developed. In the future, he believes more of us will send emails through voice input programs rather than keyboards. Pointing to Google Glass as an example, Bellows sees email adjusting and adapting to innovative new tech in ways that, for now, remain largely speculative. Augmented intelligence, Bellows says, will help us figure out what to say, along with whom to say it to. And our conversation histories will more adequately inform us about whom we speak to and and how we know them. All of this, it seems, will help to increase the productivity of the ever-increasing pool of digital workers. 3. Personalized design Kevin Fox, former user experience design lead at Google and the original creator of the Gmail interface, sees the future of email design evolving on a similar path to that of the greater web. \"Email is so much the lowest common denominator in terms of design,\" Fox tells Mashable. \"Lots of communication that would\\'ve been done through email 10 years ago is now being done through chat, social networks and texting.\" More than ever, there is reason for email providers to start thinking seriously about design. To Fox, this means a greater focus on message building. Similar to Twitter bios or Facebook cover photos, Fox believes the emails you compose in the future will have more user personality included. According to Fox, message composing could adapt a system somewhat similar to pre-built template documents, creating greater ease in messaging, depending on whom you\\'re communicating with. 4. Large user growth through mobile Approximately 6 billion people will be using email in 10 years, according to Bellows. As more of the world\\'s population gets connected, the need for innovation and structural changes will only grow. Experts agree that most of those users will come from mobile. \"Mobile usage is growing very fast — that\\'s why we\\'ve invested so heavily in it,\" Gawley says. \"That\\'s certainly where we see a lot of growth.\" According to Fox, the increase in mobile use will likely lead to more ways users can send emails. \"Email on mobile devices is more of a reading tool,\" he says. \"You\\'ll compose a message if you have to, but it\\'ll be shorter and there\\'ll be mistakes.\" Fox believes more and more emails will be created in ways other than through simply opening a compose window typing up a message. While the future of email is largely hypothetical at this point in time, it seems clear that it will finally get a bit more exciting.   The Many Faces of Gmail: A 10-Year Retrospective        2004: Launch According to Google lore, a user \"kvetched about spending all her time filing messages or trying to find them,\" and asked Google to solve her email woes. This led an engineer to start working on the service as a \"20% time\" project, company-slang for employees\\' passion projects. Gmail would famously stay in beta until 2009, five years after launch.   Image:  Screenshot, Google         2006: Chat and Calendar 2006 was a year of rapid expansion for Gmail. Google launched chat in February, Gmail for domains three days later and Google Calendar in April.  Image:  Screenshot, Google         2010: Priority Inbox The August 2010 launch of Priority Inbox separated incoming mail into three folders: \"Important and unread,\" \"Starred\" and \"Everything else.\" The service intended to help users bogged down by subscription emails   Image:  Screenshot, Google         2011: Visual Upheaval The massive design update in 2011 was Google\\'s first real attempt at reducing visual clutter. Profile pictures were added to conversations, HD themes were added and the option to display your inbox as \"comfortable,\" \"cozy\" or \"compact\" helped users with different screen sizes.   Image:  Screenshot, Google         2013: Categories The latest visual update separates incoming emails into separate tabs, further reducing inbox clutter and sparing users the stress caused by an endless stream of email notifications from social networks.

Today, the app has been downloaded on Google Play close to a billion times.

       " ' In her lecture “Hacking Healthcare: How Makers can Save Medicine” at the 2013 Bay Area Maker Faire, Dr. Amy Baxter, an Atlanta-based pediatrician and pain researcher, told the story of taking her 4-year-old son in for a routine vaccination. Like many people, her son Max was scared of needles, so she came armed with topical anesthetic cream to numb the pain, books for distraction and a juice box for a soothing sensation. But a gruff nurse came in, discredited the numbing cream by saying it didn’t work, then proceeded to tell Max to “sit there, don’t move, this is going to hurt.” SEE ALSO: Power Wheels Resurrected In Racing League  Max was so traumatized, he began vomiting. In fact, from then on, he did so every time he heard he was scheduled for a doctor’s appointment, regardless if he needed a shot. That’s when Baxter came up with the idea for Buzzy, a device that takes the sting out of getting stuck by a needle. The device consists of a vibrating motor and a wing-shaped ice pack to confuse the body’s nerves and distract attention away from a needle’s poke. In the same way that running a burn under cold water reduces the pain, Buzzy uses the gate theory to stimulate cold receptors in the nervous system to block sharp pain. Baxter first came up with the idea when, after driving home from a late shift at the hospital, she noticed her hands were numb from gripping the vibrating steering wheel for an extended period of time. She eventually tested her idea using a Turboflex vibrator and a bag of frozen peas. In 2006, Baxter established MMJ Labs to further develop her prototypes and find other solutions for relieving sharp pain. Through a series of grants and awards, Buzzy was officially launched in 2009, and since then Baxter has been promoting the device and even conducting academic research that showed Buzzy significantly reduces pain by around 50% in children and 80% in adults. Those needing weekly or daily injections, such a patients afflicted with rheumatism and diabetes, are expected to benefit from the device, but Baxter says Buzzy works just as well for shots, bee stings, boo-boos and injected medicines. For bee stings or splinters, Buzzy comes with Bee-Stractors, cards that fit into notches on the device to shield tweezers as they do their digging. SEE ALSO: Video Game Without Video Blasts Off  The original Buzzy can be ordered online for $39.95, along with a variety of accessories. Sure, fear of needles may sound like small potatoes next to bigger medical issues like cancer and $500 co-pays, but the sheer fact that Baxter identified a problem and hacked a solution truly embodies the Maker Faire spirit.

Shoppers who purchased items received a cancellation email and refund. The email contains no additional information as to why the shop is no longer online. Society6 did not immediately respond to our request for comment.  Our story in its original form appears below.  American art enthusiasts, pull out your wallets.  Earlier this month, George W.

Due to the unclear nature of art appropriation laws, however, the artist behind this project could potentially argue that printing these images on household items qualifies as creating \"new\" art.  In April 2013, a ruling in Cariou v. Prince stated that artist Richard Prince’s pieces made fair use of photographs taken by Patrick Cariou. The ruling overturned an earlier court decision that determined Prince infringed on Cariou\\'s copyrighted work.  Copyright infringement is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and this ruling didn\\'t provide any hard-and-fast rules for determining infringement. It did, however, suggest that remixing an original work of art can create new art. Only a court can decide if housewares featuring Bush\\'s paintings count as new, original artwork.

The minifigure cast even discuss their real-life voice actors, including a not-so-humble Morgan Freeman, who jokes, \"That man could read the phone book and make it sound interesting.\" With such a star-studded cast featuring the voices of Cobie Smulders, Channing Tatum, Liam Neeson, Jonah Hill, Alison Brie, Charlie Day and more, we\\'re counting down the days until The Lego Movie hits theaters. BONUS: 15 Cool Lego Minifigure Facts to Build Into Your Brain    LEGO Minifigure Facts        1. In 1976, a team of early LEGO designers sawed and filed lego bricks into the tiny human form, creating the first ever minifigure prototype.  It took three years and 51 prototypes before they arrived at what would become the modern-day minifigure.  Image: Flickr, bfishadow         2. A minifigure stands at exactly four LEGO bricks high, without a hat or hair piece. This makes it easy for minifigures to fit inside LEGO structures.  Image: Flickr, Sip Khoon         3. The female minifigure went through many concept stages before it was decided that she would have two standard legs like the male minifigure.   Image: Flickr, mac_filko         4. LEGO designers chose the color yellow to best represent all races and ethnicities.   Image: Flickr, mac_filko         5. All male minifigures wore hats until 1979 when the LEGO designers created the first hair pieces.   Image: Flickr, bfishadow         6. The total number of minifigures produced could fill about 170 standard-sized swimming pools.   Image: Flickr, Joe Shlabotnik         7. About 12 minifigures are produced every second.   Image: Flickr, mac_filko         8. The reason most minifigures heads have holes in their studs is to prevent choking if they are accidentally swallowed by small children.   Image: Flickr, dangoodwin         9. Minifigure designers rarely give characters printed noses so as to keep the graphics as neat as possible.   Image: Flickr, Sunfox         10. In 1999, LEGO Star Wars became the toy company\\'s first ever licensed theme set.   Image: Flickr, Rob Young         11. In 2007, LEGO created 10,000 gold chrome C-3PO minifigures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Wars, as well as two 14-carat gold versions. The toy company randomly packaged these special edition minifigures in LEGO Star Wars toy sets.  Image: Flickr, CJ Isherwood         12. Boba Fett from the Star Wars Cloud City LEGO set is one of rarest and most collectable minifigures ever created.   Image: Flickr, Spielbrick Films         13. In 2003, NBA Basketball minifigures were the first figures to feature spring-loaded legs and arms and hands constructed to hold and slam dunk a mini basketball. NBA minifigures were also the first to be based on real people, including Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol.  Image: Flickr, chrisjtse         14. To celebrate the 10th series of LEGO Minifigures, 5,000 Mr. Gold minifigures were packaged in cases at random. Mr. Gold is the only character to date who cannot be found in every box of Minifigure bags.  Image: Flickr, betsyweber         15.

       " ' In the coming decades, NASA has big plans for Mars, including intentions to blast a fifth rover onto the planet’s surface by 2020 and send a manned mission by 2030. But long before humans step onto Mars’ barren terrain, scientists and researchers from around the world want to understand more about its potential to support human life. See also: The Stray Rover on the Far Side of Mars They\\'re especially interested in the possibility of growing plants on Mars, a more efficient process that would partially remove the need to ship expensive freeze-dried rations to the planet. Allowing crops to grow there that produce oxygen and scrub carbon dioxide there would make Mars a more livable environment. “For a long-term settlement, there is probably no other option than growing food on Mars,” says Angelo Vermeulen, a Belgian artist and scientist who was the crew commander of the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation Site (HI-SEAS), a six-person, NASA-funded team that spent four months last year on the hills of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii to study and experiment with ways to prepare foods on Mars.  The HI-SEAS habitat was located on in an abandoned quarry of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.Image:  Angelo Vermeulen/ HI-SEASWhy we need plants on Mars The HI-SEAS team selected Mauna Loa because they believe the mineralogy of its basaltic, volcanic soil is similar to that of Mars. Vermeulen says one of the team\\'s main concerns was combating what\\'s known as \"menu fatigue\" in astronauts. \"It\\'s a psychological phenomenon also found in the military that you develop when you eat the same foods over and over again,\"\\xa0he tells Mashable. \"After a while you start eating less and your physical condition goes down. The last thing you want is a skinny, underfed astronaut.\" While the HI-SEAS team\\'s primary research goal was to compare pre-packaged foods and meals astronauts could make with a limited supply of shelf-stable ingredients, members were also encouraged to devise their own studies on the Mars mock-up. Vermeulen chose to research food growth and remote-operated, robotic farming. Along with Simon Engler, a scientific programmer specializing in robotics, Vermeulen set out to grow crops in a distant location that could not be readily accessed by the crew. To do so, he and Engler devised a spiral hydroponics garden system with a central robotic arm.  Eventually, Vermeulen says, he was able to germinate the seeds of a host of crops, including arugula, two types of lettuce, two types of chard and spinach. While many of the plants were underdeveloped due to factors like not enough LED lighting, Vermeulen says he\\'s encouraged by the results of his first prototype.  \"The goal is to develop a system where robotics can take over part of the maintenance and food growing tasks, and, as such, free up time for the astronauts,\" he says. Vermeulen also experimented with growing sprouts to give the HI-SEAS team a change of pace from shelf food. He used commercially available sprouting systems, built his own system by hacking plastic containers and even used a\\xa03D-printed\\xa0sprouting system, reflecting the resourcefulness and creativity required during a mission. Eventually, Vermeulen adds, the sprouting project yielded\\xa0alfalfa, broccoli, clover, radish and mung bean. He says the mung beans were used in a curry dish consumed by the astronauts, and the alfalfa were added to a sushi recipe. The prospect of successful food growth on Mars is promising in part because plant waste there could be composted and mixed with Martian soil to make more effective crops, a similar process to what occurs in lava fields when plant species slowly colonize a basaltic landscape and lend their organic materials to it. Martian soil Ecologist Dr. Wieger Wamelink of the Alterra Institute in the Netherlands also recently studied the possibility of food growth on Mars. Wamelink planted seeds of 14 plants on artificial Martian soil provided by NASA and compared those crops to a control group that used soil from the nearby banks of the Rhine River.  Dr. Wieger Wamelink arranges pots of faux Mars and Moon soils.Image:  Joep FrisselSurprisingly, Wamelink says, all 14 plants species germinated in the Martian soil and many even outgrew their counterparts in the Rhine soil. Wamelink also observed that the Martian soil contained more nitrogen and held water better than he originally believed it would. \"The germination was quite good,\" he says. \"Rye and cress germinated within 24 hours and after about a month, the rye, cress and a wild plant — field mustard — started growing flowers.\" Wamelink says he was especially pleased that he was able to fertilize a few plants by hand with a brush. Eventually, he says, the cress and field mustard plants grew seeds, which is a welcome sign to ecologists hoping to reproduce plants in Martian soil. If astronauts are able to continually grow fresh food on Mars through reproduction, it would bode well for them both physically and mentally — growing and then sharing food is a source of psychological well-being. \"You enjoy little gestures.\" ',\n",
       " ' Thirty years ago this week, Apple aired its \"1984\" commercial during the Super Bowl, teasing the Macintosh personal computer. Two days later on Jan. 24, cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs officially unveiled the device at the Flint Center near Apple\\'s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.  Both of these are now considered pivotal moments in Apple\\'s history and the history of personal-computing technology. Far less well-known, however, is that six days after the Flint Center appearance, Jobs did a public demonstration of the Mac on the other side of the country in front of the Boston Computer Society.  See also: Thank You, Macintosh OS, for Changing the World Footage of that appearance, along with the backstory of how it happened and how the event almost fell apart, are now online for the first time courtesy of Harry McCracken, TIME magazine\\'s editor-at-large.  \"I would have been there, if I hadn’t blown it,\" McCracken writes. \"What I was doing the night that Steve Jobs came to Boston I don’t remember, but I’ve been wincing about my misplaced priorities ever since.\" McCracken reached out to people involved with the event, and discovered that there were analog recordings, but nothing else. Recently, though, three of the people with the Boston Computer Society partnered with another organization and a venture capitalist to digitize the video.  The end result, as you can see below, is more than 90 minutes of footage showing Jobs giving a theatrical introduction to the Mac, demoing it to the audience and answering questions on stage along with other Apple employees. The video shows clear flashes of the Steve Jobs that people would come to know at Apple keynotes in the following decades.          ',\n",

       " ' Samsung will announce its next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S IV, next month on March 14. We know this because the company said so — an act simultaneously like and unlike the approach by its chief mobile rival, Apple. Apply typically doesn\\'t say anything about what it\\'s going to unveil, preferring instead to shroud its events with false mystery — false because everyone always knows what Apple products are coming through rumors and leaks, even if they don\\'t know the details. And Apple may tease (it did so with the iPhone 5, sending invites with a large \"5\" on them), but almost never pre-announces anything. That\\'s why Samsung giving the name of the product in advance isn\\'t like Apple, but the fact that it\\'s choosing to unveil a major product at its own marquee event is very Apple-like. Samsung is now the top smartphone maker worldwide, and its unveilings rightly command attention comparable to Apple\\'s. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S III: Not So Human After All [REVIEW]  Even though Samsung\\'s Galaxy phones lead all other Android models, the iPhone 5 is still the single most popular phone in the world. Samsung has come a long way since it was primarily known for appliances, but it\\'s still in second place. Nevertheless, there\\'s no question it has the momentum. With the Galaxy S IV, it has an opportunity to do what seemed impossible less than a year ago: Overtake the iPhone as the No. 1 smartphone in the world (something it briefly did last year). Samsung can actually beat Apple at its own game. However, Apple didn\\'t rise to the top of the mobile world by accident. The iPhone still delivers one of the best experiences in smartphones, with a well-rounded ecosystem, and the hardware is beautiful. Samsung\\'s Galaxy line doesn\\'t have quite have all the pieces of the puzzle, but it could get there with the S IV. Here\\'s how. 1. Bring on the Magic Apple likes to toss around the word \"magical\" to describe its products, and although that\\'s mostly Kool-Aid, there\\'s some justification for it. Apple has done a good job of injecting the \"wow\" factor into its mobile products for the past six years, and although Android has caught up to a large extent in the last year with Jelly Bean, Apple was the one who pioneered many of the things that we take for granted in a mobile experience, such as fluid animation that responds instantly to touch. Although it\\'s harder to wow mobile users today, a few people are doing it. The screen of the new BlackBerry Z10, for example, uses sensors to detect finger swipes even in sleep mode, letting you wake it up without touching any physical buttons. That\\'s the kind of magical thing that Samsung is bordering on already with its Smart Stay feature, which uses the front-facing camera to detect if you\\'re looking at the phone, keeping the screen from timing out. If the Galaxy S IV toook that to the next level by, say, letting you actually turn on the phone just by looking at it, or speaking to it, would be a good start to laying claim to some of that Apple \"magic.\"  2. A Better Ecosystem The fact that the iPhone is tied to iTunes — both the software and the store — has been a key part of its success. iCloud, along with its seamless backing up of photos and other content, has taken it a step further. Samsung\\'s ecosystem is comparatively weak. The company has a jumble of multiple digital storefronts (called \"hubs\"), its horribly named \"AllShare\" cloud-storage system, plus some partnerships with third parties including Dropbox and SugarSync. Compared to Apple\\'s single-storefront, set-up-once system, Samsung\\'s is a mess. Samsung would do itself a world a good if, with the Galaxy S IV, it would finally offer a clear ecosystem. It should either cut away the partnerships and go all-in on its own system, or just use Google\\'s, which isn\\'t perfect either but at least Google Play is relatively consistent. 3. Fewer Tricks, More Features Samsung\\'s approach to the feature set on its smartphones — particularly the Galaxy S III — has been the shotgun approach: Blast a bunch of features at consumers with questionable usefulness, and something will hit. Smart Stay was a good idea; Share Shot (which lets a group of people share pictures at an event), not so much.  In addition, some of these functions aren\\'t very well thought out. Having the GSIII\\'s camera automatically suggest tags based on people\\'s faces is good, but since those tags don\\'t work with Facebook, it\\'s not as useful as it could be. While any feature will find its share of fans, giving users a grab bag of trinkets isn\\'t nearly as good as giving a big gift they didn\\'t even know they wanted. Apple\\'s done this a few times with the iPhone, introducing major features features such as the Retina display, FaceTime, iCloud and Siri Think about the Galaxy S III: What\\'s it\\'s standout feature, other than just being a Samsung Galaxy? With its successor, Samsung would benefit from focusing on one or two big features instead of inundating users with stupid gadget tricks. Quality over quantity. 4. Improved Durability One of the sad truths about Samsung\\'s phones is that they just kind of feel cheap. Recently, Samsung went with plastic backs for most of its mobile devices to cut down on weight (and probably production costs), but they\\'ve also had the effect of making the device appear low-end when you put it next to, say, the aluminium-unibody HTC One. On top of that, the Galaxy S III has failed its share of drop tests that have left the iPhone 5 still ticking. It\\'s not the world\\'s most durable phone, partly because a its large (4.8-inch) screen is harder to protect than a smaller display. At the same time, competitors such as Sony (whose new devices are waterproof) have found that durability is a differentiator that consumers care about. Phones get dropped, phones get dinged and phones get submerged — if it hasn\\'t happened to you, it has to someone you know. If the Galaxy S IV actually ends up beating the iPhone 5 in stress tests, that\\'s a headline that will be written over and over again. 5. Mobile Payments, for Real Mobile payments on Samsung phones are already almost certainly in the works, and it represents a ball that Samsung has picked up because Apple left it lying on the ground. Mobile payments in many countries — especially the U.S. — is a big fat boondoggle because there are so many cooks in the kitchen, from wireless carriers to hardware manufacturers to merchants to ecosystem managers. Getting all those stars to align is something only a multibillion-dollar company with a lot of market and mindshare could actually do. So far Apple has been reluctant to advance in mobile payments, leaving near-field communication (NFC) out of the iPhone 5 and instead offering its slow-to-catch-on Passbook app. At Mobile World Congress, Samsung announced it was partnering with Visa to include NFC mobile payments on its phones. Since Visa works closely with merchants and is a partner in Isis (the carrier-blessed partnership for mobile payments in the U.S.), Samsung could finally be the company to take NFC payments mainstream in America. All IV Nothing? About a year ago, Samsung had just launched a marketing campaign specifically targeting Apple, painting its adherents as uncool and Samsung products as the \"Next Big Thing.\" But when its commercial for the Galaxy Note (with a stylus!) debuted during Super Bowl 2012, many laughed Samsung off as the one that was out of touch. No one\\'s laughing anymore. Samsung\\'s market share has skyrocketed, it\\'s due to release it\\'s second major smartphone since the iPhone 5 debuted, and Google is reportedly worried about how powerful it\\'s getting. Some major developers are even building versions of their apps specifically for Samsung\\'s products. To keep the momentum going, however, Samsung needs to take the most important play from the Apple playbook: Deliver an outstanding product.

Temple Run creator Imangi Studios announced the game Tuesday morning, shortly after Samsung announced its own virtual reality headset that harnessed the power of the upcoming Galaxy Note 4. In this all-new Temple Run VR, players run across a frozen landscape from an \"Arctic Demon Monkey.\" See also: 10 Nearly Impossible Mobile Games The virtual reality Temple Run switches the groundbreaking mobile endless runner from third person to first person. Players move across icy bridges, jump across mountaintops and dodge slippery sections, all while being chased by a new, scary foe. The first-person action means the only way players can see their pursuer is by actually looking over their shoulder. The Temple Run franchise, created by a husband and wife team, has been downloaded over a billion times on mobile devices.  Temple Run VR has no release date, but will be a launch title for the Gear VR headset when it does come to market. ',\n",
       " ' In the early hours of Aug. 24,  a 6.0 magnitude earthquake jolted Californians awake in terror across the Bay Area. But one UC Berkeley professor received five seconds of warning from a $110 homemade device. Now, Josh Bloom has gone public with his invention to drive investment in a statewide early earthquake warning system.  California already has a warning system network called Shake Alert, but lacks the political will to fund the five-year process of building it out into a robust public warning system.  See also: Satellite Maps Use Stunning Colors to Show Napa Quake\\'s Impact Nobody can predict when an earthquake will occur. However, an earthquake\\'s shockwaves move at the speed of sound, whereas digital messages move at the speed of light. When seismographs detect an earthquake\\'s early, imperceptible waves they can warn the areas around the epicenter before the more dangerous waves hit. Both Mexico and Japan have warning systems like this - Tokyo received an estimated 80 seconds of warning before the 2011 quake.  California\\'s Shake Alert uses data from the California Integrated Seismological Network. Both were developed by a consortium that includes Caltech, UC Berkeley, the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Governor\\'s Office of Emergency Services and the California Geological Survey.  In September 2013, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law compelling the California Office of Emergency Services to build it out for the public. But since then, Shake Alert has received just $10 million of the $80 million it needs, according to The Verge.  “It’s a political question, not a financial question,\" Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom told attendees at a warning system conference last week, according to KQED. He pledged the money would come.  Bloom can access Shake Alert because he sits on the board of the Berkeley Seismology Lab. When his device receives a notification of an incoming quake by Wi-Fi, it blares \"Earthquake! Earthquake!\" and begins a countdown.  The five seconds warning Bloom received might not sound like much, but according to Shake Alert, it only takes seconds to turn off stoves, move away from heavy furniture and take cover under a sturdy table. Outside, gas lines can be shut off and trains can be slowed, possibly saving thousands of lives.  \"If you\\'re a neurosurgeon, you can put the knife away\" during that time, Bloom said.  Bloom emphasizes to Mashable that his device couldn\\'t help anyone right now. Even if someone built their own, they wouldn\\'t be able to connect to Shake Alert, which he said isn\\'t \"robust\" enough for public use. He compares his device to a beta version of an app.  As an astronomy professor, Bloom might seem an unlikely candidate to build an warning system, but he likes tinkering with electronics. His realization that seismologists deal with the same \"noisy dirty streaming sensor data\" as astrophysicists do, helped encourage him to build his warning system. He built the device mostly for fun, he said, but after the Napa quake, he thought people should know about it. He deliberately built the sensor from easily available materials such as Raspberry Pi commercial board, an SD card and a powerful speaker.  Once it\\'s known how easy these devices are to construct, Bloom hopes that the government and private foundations will find the money.  \"$800 million is a no-brainer,” he said   ',\n",
       " '     The main title sequence for Showtime\\'s new series The Affair will feature music from a familiar voice: Grammy-winning Fiona Apple. Apple\\'s \"Container\" is an unreleased song she resurrected and revamped for The Affair after show creator Sarah Treem approached her to provide the theme music. See also: Listen to Lorde\\'s Haunting \\'Hunger Games\\' Song \\'Yellow Flicker Beat\\' The final rendition of \"Container,\" an eerie tune with dark lyrics, is inspired by the show’s narrative, which is about the complexities of an extramarital relationship. \"I was screaming into the canyon at the moment of my death; the echo I created outlasted my last breath,\" Apple sings. \"My voice it made an avalanche and buried a man I never knew, and when he died his widowed bride met his daddy and they made you. I have only one thing to do and that\\'s to be the wave that I am and then sink back into the ocean.\" The Affair stars Dominic West, Ruth Wilson, Maura Tierney and Joshua Jackson.  Showtime describes the series, which premieres Oct. 12, as such:  Noah is a New York City schoolteacher and novelist who is happily married, but resents his dependence on his wealthy father-in-law. Alison is a young waitress trying to piece her life and marriage back together in the wake of a tragedy. Set in Montauk at the end of Long Island, the provocative drama unfolds separately from both the male and female perspectives, using the distinct memory biases of both to tell the story. Treem said she\\'s honored and humbled that Apple lent her song to the show.  \"If our show can approach one tenth of the depth and complexity of her song, I\\'ll be very happy,\" Treem said in a statement.

       " ' LAS VEGAS — To monitor and surveil suspected criminals, the Federal Bureau of Investigation hacks into their computers and smartphones, installing malware and so-called spyware on those devices. For these operations, the FBI uses the services of contracting companies; information that has come to light mainly due to research performed on LinkedIn.   The feds are increasingly using these tactics, which are typically employed by cybercriminals, to access a target\\'s communication when they don\\'t have another lawful way of doing it, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. It\\'s the FBI\\'s answer to what they call \"going dark\" — when certain communications can\\'t be easily wiretapped.  See also: Is It the Dawn of the Encryption App? \"There will always be very sophisticated criminals who use communications modalities that are virtually impossible to intercept through traditional means,\" FBI\\'s Valerie Caproni said at a congressional hearing in 2011. \"The government understands that it must develop individually tailored solutions for those sorts of targets.\" For Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, when Caproni says \"tailored solutions,\" she actually means something else.  \"What she means is hacking and malware,\" Soghoian said in a presentation on the topic at the hacking conference Def Con on Friday.  The arm of the FBI responsible for these kind of operations is the Remote Operations Unit (ROU). And to get access to a potential criminal\\'s computer, the unit develops its own hacking and spying tools, but sometimes it gets them from contracting companies, who send employees to help the feds in their operations.  It was Soghoian himself who noticed the name of that that unit in a heavily redacted document (.PDF) obtained by the digital rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation. That unit piqued his curiosity and he spent six months researching it online, mainly using open source intelligence, i.e., Google and LinkedIn. His online research is what led to the WSJ scoop. \"What I found is that the FBI is in the hacking business too,\" Soghoian said.  Soghoian first found materials on training seminars for prosecutors that listed the ROU\\'s Unit Chief as a speaker. His name is Eric Chuang. Just by googling his name, Soghoian found a Zoominfo page that described Chuang\\'s job as \"lawful computer collection capabilities in support of FBI investigations.\" His LinkedIn research also led to more information. Specifically, Soghoian found who else is in the hacking business along with the FBI: \"A couple\" of companies claim to supply people to the FBI for these operations.  \"Contractors, like everyone else, they want to keep their resume up to date, in case they get a new job,\" explained Soghoian to a large crowd packed inside the Penn and Teller Theater at the Rio Hotel. \"And they list things in their resume, maybe things they shouldn\\'t be listing, revealing what they did at their old job.\" Soghoian quoted from the profiles (that appear to have been removed or hidden) of two employees of James Bimen Associates, a government contractor based in Virginia. \"Worked with FBI case agents with our surveillance imagery software that is currently installed on criminal subject machines in the field,\" read one, according to Soghoian.  It\\'s with the help of these contractors that the FBI gets access to computers. Access that is sometimes gained via email phishing attacks that lead a suspect to install malware on their computer. That malicious software then allows the FBI to turn on the microphone or camera on his or her smartphone and laptop. Other times, according to officials who spoke to the WSJ, they use zero-day exploits, security holes that haven\\'t been patched yet. Mark Eckenwiler, a former federal prosecutor and surveillance law expert, told the WSJ that these techniques might be illegal without a search warrant, unless they only concerned metadata, in which case a lower standard court order might be enough. Regardless of the current law, Soghoian notes that the hacking operations have been performed in the dark, without public discussion. \"There hasn\\'t been a debate in Congress about the FBI getting into the hacking business, there hasn\\'t been any legislation giving this power, this just sort of happened out of nowhere,\" Soghoian said. \"Had it not been for the sloppy actions of a few contractors eagerly updating their LinkedIn profiles, we would\\'ve never known about this.\" Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images ',\n",

He then pointed the finger at the Ukrainians for downing the doomed jetliner, saying, \"The Ukrainians had the technical capabilities and the motives to do it,” before producing the missing black boxes (which are actually orange in color). Representatives for the Malaysian delegation then signed a document to formalize the handover.  #MH17 black boxes now in hands Malaysia delegation. pic.twitter.com/lFL5Wm4wWi — Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) July 21, 2014   Earlier coverage: TOREZ, Ukraine — The train cars loaded with the bodies of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 passengers pulled away from the Torez station at 7 p.m. local time on Monday, leaving behind a pile of possessions on the platform.

Borodai also pledged to hand over the black boxes to the Malaysian team and grant them unfettered access to the crash site.  2: At approx 9pm tonight Ukraine time, the 2 black boxes will be handed over to a M\\'sian team in Donetsk who will take custody of them. — Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) July 21, 2014  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko confirmed the news in a statement on his official website, saying the train was headed toward Kharkiv through the embattled city of Donetsk. Poroshenko said he had commanded his armed forces to “take all the necessary steps to ensure the security of the train until its arrival to the destination point.” The deal came as a result of backroom negotiations between the Malaysian team and the pro-Russian rebels in charge of the crash site in eastern Ukraine. \"In recent days, we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the MH17 crash site,\" Razak said Monday night as a team of Malaysian investigators arrived in the area. \"That contact has now been made,\" he said. \"Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all: securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation, and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.\" Razak made his announcement as President Barack Obama called reports that the rebels were removing bodies from the crash site “the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations.” “They have repeatedly prevented international investigators from gaining full access to the wreckage,\" Obama said. \"As investigators approached, they fired their weapons into the air. These separatists are removing evidence from the crash site, all of which begs the question: What exactly are they trying to hide?” Obama said the burden was on Russia to insist that the separatists \"stop tampering with the evidence\" and \"grant investigators who are already on the ground immediate, full and unimpeded access to the crash site.\"  But Razak, seemingly, had already taken the lead. The prominent role of the Malaysian prime minister was unexpected. It comes four months after his government was widely criticized for its slow response in the wake of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which was lost and presumed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. There was little chance the rebels would work with Kiev in brokering a deal, so perhaps it was not all that surprising. \"At times I wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that we feel,\" Razak said. \"But sometimes, we must work quietly in service of a better outcome.\" Over the weekend, Ukrainian authorities asked that the bodies be taken to Kharkiv, about 185 miles north, where some of the country\\'s best forensics facilities are located, and where a crisis center has been set up to accommodate families of the victims. But the rebels have not been cooperating with the central government in Kiev, which has launched an \"anti-terror operation\" to root them out of the territory they have occupied since April. The nearly four-month bloody conflict has cost hundreds of lives and displaced tens of thousands from the eastern regions of Ukraine.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' LONDON — In the lead up to D-Day, close to 2 million American troops had been stationed in the United Kingdom, and in May of 1944, Hyde Park was often dominated by American soldiers. Some played softball, some rowed on the Serpentine, but many simply spent time with their (usually newly acquired) British girlfriends. In only a few weeks, thousands would face the carnage of Omaha Beach. These photographs of American soldiers enjoying the pleasures of London’s Hyde Park were taken by LIFE staff photographer Ralph Morse and published in the May 29 edition of the magazine. See also: \\'Full Victory — Nothing Else\\': Iconic D-Day Images for Its 70th Anniversary One photograph shows some sheep grazing in Kensington Gardens, which adjoins Hyde Park. Flocks of sheep had been used since the 1920s to manage grass growth in several London parks — Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Clapham Common and Hampstead Heath. The fattened sheep were driven to Smithfield Meat Market to be sold. Another photograph shows a pair of soldiers demonstrating Jitterbug dancing to British girls. The term “Jitterbug” had originally meant an alcoholic - someone with \"the jitters” - but by 1944 it had come to mean dancing in an uninhibited, unrestricted way. 1944 was the year that the United States introduced a 30 percent tax (later reduced to 20 percent) on night clubs with dancing, and the troops stationed in Britain had brought their semi-prohibited dancing across the Atlantic to a country tired and bored of war - and also largely free of men. November 1945’s Billboard magazine reported that “A campaign to stop the \\'rude American dancing,\\' known as jitterbugging, has been started in London.” With the end of the war, GIs stationed in Britain had largely returned to America by the end of 1945, yet “English couples are carrying on in the jitterbug style — much against the wishes of the ruling class.” New Yorker Ralph Morse was 37 when he took these photographs. He was the youngest war correspondent when LIFE first sent him to the European theater of war in 1942.   D-Day Romance in Hyde Park         Kissing under a tree in Hyde Park.

She was also known for several scandals throughout her life, including an affair with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, for whom she left her husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini.

       " ' During a massive bombardment this week, Israel hit Gaza\\'s only power plant, effectively shutting it down for good.  With one of the main sources of electricity in the Gaza Strip knocked out, the population now faces severe blackouts that will affect the distribution of water and force already overcrowded and over-stretched hospitals and shelters to run on generators.  See also: \\'Shocking and Disappointing\\': U.S. Pushes Back Against Israeli Media Reports And it\\'s not just the power plant that\\'s been hit. Power lines running from Israel have also ben damaged in the more than three weeks of conflict, leaving residents with very little power. \"There\\'s no electricity at all in Gaza City,\" Sara Badiei, a water engineer for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, told Mashable. \"They are completely, absolutely in the dark.\" The whole Gaza Strip normally receives around 210 megawatts of electricity: 60 from the power plant, 120 from power lines that run from Israel, and 28 from lines coming from Egypt. With the power plant offline, nine out of 10 lines from Israel also damaged, and only the lines from Egypt running almost at full capacity, more than 80% of the usual electrical energy supply has been knocked out, Biadei said, basing her estimate on information she gathered from the Gaza power company.   Blackout for the 2nd day. Everything is getting darker, louder & closer. Panic & fear everywhere #Gaza #GazaUnderAttack — dalia lababidi-Gaza (@daliaZLababidi) July 30, 2014  Even before the war started, Gaza had issues with the supply of electricity, which only supported 50% of the demand, according to Biadei.  \"What they had to do pre-war was a distribution scheme where people got eight hours on, eight hours off,\" she said. Now, only certain pockets in the Gaza strip get electricity at all, and when they do, they get one or two hours a day.  With so little power, everyone is trying to cope as well as they can. Hospitals run on generators. For Biadei, the most potentially dangerous issue is water distribution. Without power, water can\\'t be pumped through the pipes which means people will have no drinking water and no water to bathe. There\\'s an additional risk that the sewage systems could flood the streets, adding to the health concerns. \"When you have populations living in...high density, that\\'s when contagious diseases can break out,\" she added.  2nd day of power cut: food in the fridge rotted, water on th verge of force bc we can not run the motor, Mobile Charge almost finished#Gaza — Guess what (@Farah_Gazan) July 29, 2014  Some noted that the blackout could also weaken the flow of information coming out of the strip.   So few in #Gaza tweeting tonight. No live feed either. Todays power plant bombing was essentially a social media blackout. Now they\\'re alone — Nadeem Muaddi (@nmuaddi) July 30, 2014   Israel\\'s destroying power plant was meant to silence eyewitnesses: Most people not tweeting in Gaza bc electricity is out #GazaUnderAttack” — Laila El-Haddad (@gazamom) July 30, 2014  And it\\'s probably not going to get better.  Biadei said some damaged power lines are hard to reach because they\\'re located in areas at risk of bombing. Fathi Sheik Khalil of the Gaza energy authority told the Guardian that it will take a year to repair the power plant.  \"It\\'s not just immediate destruction,\" Biadei said in a phone interview. \"The long term effects after the war are going to be absolutely devastating, absolutely devastating. You basically are going to have to rebuild the whole strip.\"        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' As a writer by trade, it\\'s not easy for me to utter these words, but I\\'m not going to lie: On social media, a picture is worth a thousand words.It\\'s true. Content may be king, but visuals rule. All the latest studies and statistics suggest that images on social media command more attention than text alone. If you want more likes, comments, shares, retweets, and clicks, you want to include pictures with your social media posts. You want to be more visual.As Carla Gates says here on her 3 to 5 Marketing Blog... \"Images used in your social media (and by definition, your blog content) are far more attention-grabbing than text or plain old links, more likely to be shared, evoke emotional reactions in viewers (and emotion SELLS), and can portray a lot of information quickly and more efficiently than text.\"  Not to mention the fact that both Facebook and Twitter have redesigned their platforms recently to place much more emphasis on images. So you really have no excuse whatsoever not to be going picture crazy on social media right about now. Chalk it up to the Pinterest effect. In the process of optimizing your social media presence with visuals, of course, you need to be mindful of choosing the right sizes and dimensions. Other than those specifications, though, you actually have a lot of great options. For example... 1. The Product Shot. Every business and brand has a product to display. Whether you\\'re selling ice cream or insurance, software or footwear, you have something tangible to exhibit in your social media stream. Don\\'t just talk about what it is you have to offer your audience. Show it off in pictures. The more, the better.Image: Best Buy on Facebook  2. The Team Picture. Did you play organized sports growing up? How many team pictures do you have from back in the day? That\\'s the idea here. Only, don\\'t feel you have to wait for a special occasion. Take pictures of your colleagues on a regular basis and share them with your audience. People do business with people, so do everything you can to humanize your brand.  Are you ready to hear some killer \\'80s performances & vote for your fave contestants, West Coast? #idol is on NOW! pic.twitter.com/5gGE8b9HB0 — American Idol (@americanidol) April 9, 2014  3. The Spotlight on Your Fans. Everybody likes attention, especially from someone they look up to and admire. Shine the spotlight on your followers and fans. Give their photos a much bigger stage by repurposing them on your own social channels. Retweet them. Tag them. Make it all about them, not you. Give them their 15 minutes of fame and they\\'ll give you more loyalty in return.  Our first \"Fan of the Homestand\" is Cory from Boston. We return 4/18. Get your tix now & you could claim the honor. pic.twitter.com/eUHPXx2fJC — Boston Red Sox (@RedSox) April 10, 2014  4. The Peek Behind the Scenes. Provide your constituents with something they can\\'t get anywhere else, whether it\\'s exclusive photos, a big reveal, or something they wouldn\\'t see otherwise. Take them backstage. Invite them into your inner sanctum. Show them how your products are built. Give them a look at what goes on behind closed doors. You get the picture.Image: Downton Abbey on Pinterest  5. The Action Shot. While a team picture may be posed, your action shots are of you and your fellow team members actually doing what you do best. It\\'s doesn\\'t matter whether you\\'re speaking at a podium, swinging a baseball bat, or sitting in front of a computer writing the great American novel, it\\'s still a performance. Capture your people in the act of doing their jobs and share it with your audience. 6. The Graphic. Creating your own visuals from scratch is a great way to add variety to your stream and call more attention to your posts. Use PowerPoint, Photoshop, PicMonkey, and other such tools to add special effects and text to the images you share. You could even go so far as to create your own infographics. A combination of data, words, and pictures is one of the best ways to increase your engagement and reach on social media.Image: Nordstrom on Facebook  7. The Spontaneous Shot. One of the best benefits of using social media for marketing is the power it gives you to connect with your constituents in real time. In fact, it\\'s expected of you. Capitalize on the extemporaneous nature of these channels by sharing impromptu, candid shots of you and your team in the moment. What\\'s happening now is far more credible and commanding on social media than old news or posed pictures.Image: MTV on Facebook  8. The Moving Picture. No, I didn\\'t forget about video. In fact, most businesses and brands consider it a must-have ingredient in their content marketing mix. YouTube, Vine, Instagram — each of these channels presents an abundance of opportunities for creating original footage which can eventually be cross-promoted across the social landscape. Don\\'t worry about going viral. Worry about one watch at a time. If people like it, they will share it. And you\\'ll have a hit on your hands.  In pursuit of all things “awesome,” “amazing” and “that’s epic, bro,” we’ve forgotten just how good Good is. http://youtu.be/yQl2V11cUw0  — Maxwell House (@AGoodCoffee) April 14, 2014  9. The Collage. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a small handful of them is, well, perhaps priceless. Take advantage of Twitter\\'s new mobile feature and upload up to four photos in a single tweet. Or you can use one of many good photo-editing tools available — such as the aforementioned PicMonkey — to cobble together the quintessential collage.  True brilliance is remembered by its effect on people, not things. pic.twitter.com/wQjjNEF2nH — General Electric (@generalelectric) March 28, 2014  10. The Selfie. Last, but certainly not least, there\\'s the type of visual made famous by Ellen DeGeneres at this year\\'s Oscars ceremony and most recently Boston Red Sox superstar David Ortiz at the White House. There\\'s the selfie. Thanks to these two celebrities, the ubiquity of the front-facing camera on smartphones, and people\\'s seemingly insatiable desire for attention, the selfie is an incredibly hot trend you don\\'t want to ignore.        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\");    This article originally published at ClickZ here  ',\n",
       " ' Before the celebration of a resurrection on Easter, Christians pay respect and remember sacrifice. In the Christian faith, Good Friday — the Friday before Easter Sunday — marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the last day of Holy Week, or Jesus\\' last week of earthly life. See also: President Obama Meets Pope Francis for the First Time From Palestine to Port-au-Prince, Christians commemorated the life of Jesus by taking to the streets in parades on Friday, some more solemn in their remembrance and others more joyous celebrations of the resurrection. In Rome, Pope Francis led a torch-lit procession of tens of thousands at the Colosseum, known as the Way of the Cross — remembering \"desperate migrants, suicidal failed business owners, battered women, torture victims and all people suffering in the world.\"  Thousands of Christian pilgrims also took to the streets of Jerusalem in a procession known as Via Dolorosa. In cities such as London, Manila and Gauhati, India, devotees re-enacted the crucifixion, in a visceral and startling representation of the event told in the New Testament of the Bible.

       " ' For those in tech in the Bay Area, Silicon Valley doesn\\'t just hit home — it is home.  Season one is set to wrap up on June 1, and the similarities between Mike Judge\\'s version and the real thing are piling up. From the man behind satire like Idiocracy and Office Space, Silicon Valley follows a group of young entrepreneurs trying to build the next big tech startup with a ridiculous name: Pied Piper. And it\\'s pretty spot on. Stanford grads galore, sky-high-paid Googlers (and Facebookers and Applers), and startups that come and go faster than your springtime allergies. See also: 15 Celebrities Before They Were Famous With one season (almost) in the books, and season two already on the docket, we took a look at the moments in Silicon Valley that we\\'ve actually experienced in Silicon Valley. They weren\\'t too difficult to find.  1. Robot boss In a scene from episode five, Big Head, a former employees of Pied Piper, has an \"in-person\" meeting with Gavin Belson, the big-time tech executive at a fictitious Google lookalike, Hooli. Belson appears in hologram form in order to be \"present\" while talking to Big Head, and the technology used for the call is, of course, state of the art and cost \"20 million f*cking dollars.\"   It also fails miserably. The connection is bad, no one can hear, and ultimately, the meeting continues via cell phone (where the call is ultimately dropped). A clear example of the limitations of telecommuting in the age of technical innovation.  We went through a phase at Mashable where the communication method of choice was video robot. It inspired the parody below, where our robot boss can be seen zooming around the office, inspiring resentment wherever he goes.  Big Head: we know your pain.   2. Actually explaining your startup to other people By the time most startups get off the ground, they\\'re prepared (at least somewhat) to explain to an outsider what their company actually does. This does not mean it was an easy question to prep for. Most of the time, that description involves a bigger, more established company as an anchor point. \"We\\'re like Airbnb, but for parking spaces,\" \"We\\'re Uber for dogs,\" or even, \"We\\'re Yelp — for weed.\"  Startups that are built around great technology don\\'t always have it figured out right away. Others that do have it figured out may not have a CEO with the social skills to convey it. The fictional guys on the show seem to be suffering from a little bit of both.  There\\'s also mention of a company \"pivot,\" a fancy way of saying they scrapped their initial business strategy to start over in another direction. Yeah, we\\'ve heard that one before.   3. The parties are ... awkward If most tech parties didn\\'t have free booze and food, we\\'re not sure anyone would attend. In the pilot, the guys from the show take advantage of both at a Kid Rock concert at a house party. Pretty wild, right?  In real life, people will line up for hours to see a bunch of tech veterans talk about the garage that birthed their startup, but a musical artist that sells out arenas goes unnoticed.  At the Crunchies in 2013, Gza from the Wu Tang Clan rapped while most of the audience checked their phones to find out who Gza actually was. At Facebook\\'s F8 developer conference in April, I captured the crowd\\'s befuddlement as rock music blared from the stage. (In the Valley\\'s defense, the crowd got more excited for DJ Diplo\\'s performance later that night, so perhaps the drumming was just too hardcore.)  4. Leering at women? There\\'s an app for that Before joining the fictitious company Pied Piper, Big Head\\'s claim to fame was an app that \"shows you the location of a woman with erect nipples.\" The sad part? It sounds a lot like something we\\'ve heard before.  At TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013, two guys presented an app called Titstare, \"an app where you take photos of yourself staring at tits.” This actually happened. At a tech conference. The duo later claimed it was a joke, but the fact that they were invited on stage at a major tech event before people realized it was offensive sheds some light on the generally dude-centric mindset that permeates the tech world.  In October, one tech community center hosted a Hackers and Hookers Halloween party. The assumption: men are the tech minds, women are the eye candy.

       " \" Walt Disney Co., the world’s biggest entertainment company, plans to buy back $6 billion to $8 billion of stock starting next year, stepping up efforts to increase investor returns as capital spending winds down. Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., will borrow to finance some of the repurchases, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said Thursday at an investor conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., sponsored by Bank of America Corp. The company intends to maintain its debt ratings, he said. The buyback comes as outlays shrink from a peak of $3.78 billion in fiscal 2012. In recent years, Disney has expanded parks in California and Florida, built cruise ships and developed a resort in Hawaii. A new destination in Shanghai is scheduled to open at the end of 2015. “Based on the investment we have been doing, we will see an increase in cash flow,” Rasulo said. “We just worked our way through a huge capital cycle.” Disney will continue spending on projects and make acquisitions, Rasulo said, citing as examples Marvel, Lucasfilm and purchases in games and international TV networks. The company is interested in acquisitions that increase its distribution capability. “We want to invest in our businesses either through organic growth initiatives or to grow our company through acquisitions,” Rasulo said. Disney rose 3.4% to $66.11 at 2:57 p.m. in New York. The stock had gained 28% this year before the day. Buyback History Disney is a regular buyer of its stock. The company repurchased $800 million of shares in the recently completed third quarter and $3.2 billion for the year to date, Rasulo said on an Aug. 6 conference call. Disney also spent $1.81 billion on its parks, resorts and other properties during that period, according to the latest quarterly report. The company has also increased its dividend, with the 2012 annual payout boosted by 25% to $0.75 a share. Debt totaled $15 billion as of June 29, according to a filing. After a summer movie season that saw one of its biggest financial flops ever, the Jerry Bruckheimer-Johnny Depp film The Lone Ranger, Rasulo said Disney plans to limit the budgets on motion pictures to limit risks. The curbs will apply to major films that aren’t part of movie series, he said. “We feel very, very good about the direction our slate is headed in,” Rasulo said. “We’ve also learned that there needs to be a cap on tentpole, nonfranchise films.” Disney said on Aug. 6 it expects to record a loss of as much as $190 million from The Lone Ranger.

       " ' In the NX Mini, Samsung introduced a camera for the selfie-obsessed, including an LCD that flips a full 180 degrees and special settings for self portraits. Now that feature is getting a second home in the NX3000. Whereas the NX Mini prioritized a slim form factor and speed over all else, the NX3000 is a more \"traditional\" mirrorless camera. Its APS-C sensor captures the same 20 megapixels as the NX Mini\\'s, but its larger size will give image quality a boost, plus it makes the camera compatible with the diverse NX line of lenses (the Mini\\'s 1-inch sensor requires different optics). See also: 12 Most Cliché Photos on Instagram The marquee feature is the flip-up LCD, which gives selfie lovers the perfect way to set up a high-quality shot of themselves. Not only will you benefit from the NX3000\\'s lens and sensor, but the camera\\'s Self Shot mode will also automatically airbrush your selfies by default (you can turn the feature off for the \"natural\" look). You can also set it up to snap your selfie either after a 3-second countdown, when you smile or when you wink at the camera. The NX3000 has a shutter speed that maxes out at 1/4,000 of a second and can capture up to six RAW photos per second. ISO is adjustable from 100 to 25,600. Just like the NX Mini, it saves to microSD cards instead of full-size ones, both to cut down on space and make them quickly swappable into a smartphone. Image:  Samsung There\\'s a micro USB port for data and charging (it has the same battery as in many Galaxy smartphones) as well as a micro HDMI port for displaying photos and videos on a TV. The body comes in brown, black and white, and it ships with a 16-50mm power-zoom lens that includes optical image stabilization. A detachable flash is included. The NX300 will be available June 1 for the tidy sum of $529 (with 16-50mm OIS Power Zoom and a SEF-8 Flash), or about as much as the NX Mini (depending on the lens). A version with a 20-50mm lens and SEF-8 flash will also be available for the price of $479.  Whichever you choose is a question of how much you prioritize lens compatibility, overall slimness and that potential extra bump in image quality.

       " ' For the first time, researchers have teleported 10,000 bits of information per second from point A to point B across a distance of about six millimeters and inside a solid state circuit, similar to a computer chip. Although the accomplishment differs from teleporting mass, like a person — such as that seen on science fiction shows like Star Trek — the remarkable feat demonstrates what could be possible with a quantum computer. The scientists, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, report their findings in this week\\'s issue of Nature. In their experiment, the team spaced three micron-sized electronic circuits on a seven-by-seven-millimeter computer chip. Two of the circuits worked as a sending mechanism, while the other served as the receiver. The scientists cooled the chip to near absolute zero and ran a current through the circuits. The image above depicts the size of the macroscopic electrical circuits they used in the experiment relative to that of an ant.  At that frigid temperature and small scale, the electrons in the circuit — which are the quantum bits of information, the qubits — started to behave according to the rules of quantum mechanics. The qubits became entangled. This means they become linked, sharing identical quantum states, even if physically separated from one other. Specifically, the qubits in the sender circuit became entangled with those in the receiving circuit because they exchanged photons. The ETH team encoded some information into the qubits in the sending circuits and then measured of the state of the qubits in the receiver circuit. Whatever state the qubits were in the sender was reflected instantly in the receiving circuit. The researchers had teleported the information. This is different from the way computers typically transfer information, electrons carry information along wires or through the air via radio waves. In this case, no bit of data physically traveled along a route — instead the information disappeared from one location and reappeared at another. Other experimenters have teleported quantum bits, too, and have done so across a larger distance. But those teams only got the teleportation to work once in a while, perhaps a few percent of the time. The ETH team was also able to teleport up to 10,000 quantum bits every second, and get it to work right consistently. That\\'s fast enough and accurate enough to build a useful computer. \"Basically we can push a button and have this teleportation work every time,\" Andreas Wallraff, professor at the Department of Physics and head of the study, told DNews.

       " \" To date, more than $680 million has been raised on Kickstarter, as crowdfunding becomes an increasingly viable option for startups to raise much-needed funds without the help of VCs, angels or banks.   For a young, bootstrapping startup, crowdfunding is often seen as fast money that will help you build out the product or app you and your team have always dreamed about. Whether or not a project ultimately reaches its funding goals, it’s still relatively quick and easy to post your pitch and see what happens. See also: How the 'Biggest Scam in Kickstarter History' Almost Worked However, amid all of the hype and excitement surrounding crowdfunding, some of the less glamorous (but extremely important) aspects of running a business often go overlooked — particularly taxes and liability.  Liability Issues With Crowdfunding When you’re raising money from any source, it’s serious business. And while a Kickstarter project may not entail the mounds of paperwork and contracts associated with commercial lenders, project creators are still entering some kind of contract — in this case, it’s with hundreds or thousands of people.  When crowdfunding turns into a platform for taking pre-orders for a yet-to-be-finished product, there are inevitable risks. We’ve all heard stories about high-profile delivery delays like the Pebble smart watch, but they’re hardly an anomaly. A report by CNN Money found that 84% of the top 50 funded projects on Kickstarter in 2012 shipped late. When excited backers expect the same smooth fulfillment process as ordering a product from a retailer like Amazon, disappointment, frustration and worse will inevitably ensue.  It's doubtful that anyone actually creates a Kickstarter campaign with the sole intention of weaseling money out of people. However, with any technology or creative project, things don’t always go as planned — and some well-intended projects fold before they’re ever brought to fruition.  For this reason, it makes sense to launch a Kickstarter campaign through a legal business structure, such as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), as opposed to posting it as an individual. An LLC or other structure offers a layer of protection that can essentially shield your own personal assets from that of the business. So, if something should happen to your project or business, the business is liable for it, and not you personally. Make sure your LLC or corporation is officially established and then conduct all business and enter contracts through the LLC or corporation.   In addition to creating a formal business structure, you should also take the following steps:   Once your LLC or corporation is established, get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This is essentially a social security number for businesses, and you’ll need it to open your business bank account. You can apply for your business’ EIN online through the IRS site. It’s fast, simple and free. Create a business bank account. Once you get an EIN, you can open a bank account for your business. This is going to be important for keeping your business and personal finances separate (thus, helping to shield your personal assets).  Crowdfunding and Taxes The tax consequences of crowdfunding campaigns can catch project creators off guard. When you raise funds for your business through other sources, it’s considered a contribution to capital and is usually not taxed. However, funds raised on Kickstarter are considered income, and creators are issued a 1099-K (at least when they raise more than $20,000 and have more than 200 transactions).  See also: Where Does $122,874 Go After Its Kickstarter Is Canceled? Project creators can often offset this income with deductible expenses related to their project. However, some people run into trouble when their Kickstarter funds fall in a different tax year than their major expenses. For example, you might need to raise money first, then you can start spending it to build the product. To counter this scenario, some project creators opt to form a C Corporation so they have more flexibility in defining their fiscal year for tax reporting purposes (and therefore, make sure their Kickstarter income and expenses occur within the same reporting year).  The bottom line is that if you’re looking to raise more money via crowdfunding than you usually earn, you should turn to a professional tax adviser or accountant for help understanding all the nuances and implications. There’s no sense in trying to navigate the murky and evolving reality of crowdfunding and taxes on your own. Most importantly, you need to approach any Kickstarter project as a serious funded business, not a side project that’s exempt from normal business rules.

       " \" In 1971, a coffee upstart called Starbucks sought a symbol to represent its brand. After poring — or pouring, for the pun-inclined — over vintage maritime texts, they discovered an eye-catching 16th century twin-tailed mermaid.

The original brown, bare-chested Siren has evolved to a less naked and more streamlined green look.

       " ' Gun-control activists are lobbying Target to prevent people from openly carrying semi-automatic weapons in its stores, turning the company into the latest battleground of the evolving debate over gun rights in America. Target has become the fight\\'s epicenter after a series of open-carry demonstrations across the U.S., but mainly Texas, have caused companies from Chipotle to Chili\\'s to ban people from toting semi-automatic weapons in their establishments.  See also: NRA: Assault Rifle Demonstrators Are \\'Downright Scary\\' Texas law allows people to carry these rifles in public, though only in a manner that doesn\\'t cause concern, according to USA Today. Open-carry activists, especially some members affiliated with a group called Open Carry Texas, say bringing these weapons into public places will make citizens more comfortable with rifles, while gun-control group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America says the displays are designed to intimidate.  Target got caught in the debate when Moms Demand Action posted a series of photos showing members of open-carry groups walking around Target with guns. Some of the photos, a few of which were taken by the group Open Carry Tarrant County, an affiliate of Open Carry Texas, are below: Members of Open Carry Tarrant County walk around a local Target on March 10. Image: Facebook/Open Carry Texas  A woman carries a rifle through the checkout line at a Target on March 10. Image: Facebook/Open Carr Texas  “Target is where your American mom shops, and where we expect to be safe with our kids,\" Erika Soto Lamb, communications director at Everytown, the organization that oversees Moms Demand Action, told Mashable. “We would expect that a company that we support, a brand that we trust, would stand with American moms and prohibit the open carry of guns in their aisles.” Target did not immediately respond to Mashable\\'s request for comment, but the company did issue a neutral statement that seemed to express some alarm over its newfound position at the center of America\\'s heated gun-control debate. \"The safety and security of our guests and team members is our highest priority,\" company spokesperson Molly Snyder said, according to USA Today. \"Target does not sell firearms or ammunition, and while I do not have information specific to [Open Carry Texas] to share, what I can tell you is that Target is committed to following all state and federal laws.\" Open Carry Texas officials have pushed back against gun-control activists\\' move to convince Target to ban guns from its stores, partly by posting to the group\\'s Facebook page. One such post says that the photos shared by Moms Demand Action are from months ago. A man carries an assault rifle in a Target store on March 10. Image: Facebook/Open Carry Texas  \"What [gun-control activists] won\\'t tell you is that this photo was taken back in March, as you can see from the time stamp,\" according to a post on Open Carry Texas\\' Facebook page. \"They want to appear as if this is some new phenomenon.\" The group also points out that Open Carry Texas has since changed its gun-toting policy to one that respects the wishes of business owners who do not want rifles in their stores. The group did not immediately respond to Mashable\\'s request for comment. However, while Open Carry Texas is correct in saying that the photos posted by Moms Demand Action are from March or much earlier, it is incorrect in its claim that the gun-control group is pretending that the photos were taken recently. The dates on which the images were taken is clearly labeled on the Moms Demand Action website. Secondly, although Open Carry Texas has amended its policy on bringing guns into public establishments, some affiliate groups have not. One such group held a demonstration in a Target parking lot as recently as May 22.  Open Carry Texas\\' Facebook post implying that these demonstrations are not new is correct, but the plethora of media attention is.  Although companies such as Costco and California Pizza Kitchen have enforced open-carry bans for some time now, the gun-control debate began to center around companies this past September, when Starbucks requested that customers no longer bring guns into its stores. Moms Demand Action had gone after Starbucks for years in an attempt to get the company to change its neutral policy toward weapons, even though Starbucks\\' policy did not differ from many other similar food and drink shops.  The Starbucks announcement got a fair amount of attention, but open-carry demonstrations continued without much notice until gun enthusiasts walked into a Jack In The Box restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, this May. They hadn\\'t warned anyone they were coming beforehand, and their weapons scared restaurant employees so much that some of them hid in a freezer among frozen hamburgers. Moms Demand Action immediately launched a campaign to get Jack In The Box to ban guns on its property. Within a week, the company said it would not allow firearms in its stores.  But the company-centric debate really shot into the national spotlight after a group affiliated with Open Carry Texas walked into a Dallas Chipotle carrying semi-automatic rifles. The Moms Demand Action campaign machine kicked into high gear again, and Chipotle quickly came out with a statement similar to that of Starbucks, banning firearms in their restaurants, The Guardian reported. Other restaurants such as Sonic and Chili\\'s have followed suit after open-carry enthusiasts held demonstrations at those restaurants, and now that media attention is focused on the issue, gun-control activists have set their sights on Target. As part of the Moms Demand Action campaign, Shannon Watts, the organization\\'s founder, posted photos of Open Carry Texas affiliates wandering around Target with rifles slung across their bodies:  What are these guys doing in @Target\\'s baby aisles?

This does not: #OffTarget pic.twitter.com/tN8txQJShR — CoCo (@cmartin002) June 4, 2014  The organization also recognizes that it can use company support as a means for political pressure. “I think if American businesses are already [supporting gun control], I think it makes it more likely that some political leaders who haven’t had the bravery to take action might take the action they need to,\" Lamb said. The media uproar even caused a brief rift between open-carry enthusiasts and the National Rifle Association, which has been a staunch advocate for the right to own and display weapons even after mass-killings involving semi-automatic weapons put gun control in the national spotlight. A statement from the NRA\\'s legal branch, the Institute for Legislative Action, on Monday called open-carry activists \"downright weird,\" and said their demonstrations were \"scary,\" before issuing an apology the next day. While Target\\'s gun policy is sure to be the subject of much media attention in the coming days, it is a small battleground in a vicious fight over the future of gun rights in America. As Lamb made clear, influencing Target\\'s decision is only a tiny part of what gun-control activists want to accomplish. “Our ultimate goals are the safety of our families and our communities,\" Lamb said. \"This is one piece of our work.”       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

See also: New York Goes to War Against Airbnb for Disrupting Hotel Business In a message to members, the American Hotel & Lodging Association identified Airbnb by name, saying short-term online rental marketplaces are \"technically illegal, but lax enforcement of existing laws has allowed these entities to grow exponentially in size.\" The association, which represents more than 52,000 properties, said it would \"highlight the bad, unfair and in some cases unlawful business practices employed by short-term online rental companies and the lack of parity between safety, security, tax, and other requirements for hotels and short-term online rentals,\" according to travel site Tnooz. In statements to Mashable, both AH&LA and Airbnb focused on promoting tourism and improving customer experiences, instead of commenting on growing tension between the two. \"Over 11 million guests have had a safe, positive experience on Airbnb. We help promote positive experiences through a global trust and safety team available 24/7, authentic reviews, verified profile information, and the $1 Million Host Guarantee,\" an Airbnb spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The data show hotels are thriving as the sharing economy grows. We can and should work together to promote travel and tourism.\" Working together, however, is not what the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA) has in mind. In her statement, AH&LA President and CEO Katherine Lugar focused on how the hotel industry is looking to improve customer experiences.  The message to members, however, identifies key areas where the association plans to fight short-term rentals. The plan includes a campaign to target cities and regions to \"engage in select tax, safety and health fights at the council level to preempt other deals being sought by short-term online rental companies.\"  AH&LA also wants to push federal government to regulate short-term online rentals the same ways hotels are regulated, and highlight innovation within the hotel sector. Airbnb is not interested in a fight, but an organized effort by hotels with public campaigns and local government lobbying will heat things up. ',\n",
       " \"  It's not a smartwatch, but it's pretty dang close. Glance is a wristband prototype accessory that can effectively turn a regular watch into a smartwatch. Designed by Kiwi Wearables, a startup based out of Toronto, Canada, Glance can be tucked in behind a regular watch band and synced with a smartphone.  See also: 9 Top Tech Breakthroughs of 2013 The device can alert the wearer to incoming calls or text messages, track movement and be used as a remote control for a smart TV, according to the device's Kickstarter page.   Unlike many smartphones, which can only survive a few hours of optimum use before needing juice, Glance's designers created it to last for a week without charging. When its power is low, the Glance's battery can easily be recharged via its USB port, just like any other mobile device.  Glance also uses a 3D motion detector to measure movement. For example, it can tell how many steps you've taken or how many miles you've biked. It also has the added benefit of being waterproof. The team behind Glance is looking to raise $150,000 by July 3 to fund the project. So far, they have nearly 500 contributors who have collectively put up just over $41,000.  \",\n",
       " ' Human trafficking victims and concerned citizens across the United States can now send quick and discreet text messages for help, thanks to a new joint initiative to end modern slavery. Polaris Project and Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children — formerly known as the Demi and Ashton (DNA) Foundation — have teamed up with communication API service Twilio and Salesforce Foundation, providing an SMS-based program that instantly connects people to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) hotline. SEE ALSO: Why Tech and New Media Can Help End Modern Slavery  As of Thursday, the new system is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through which victims or people with knowledge of a trafficking situation can text \"BeFree\" (233733), and NHTRC call specialists will respond via text to address each individual’s needs. This could include immediate crisis response, referrals to nearby shelters and emotional support. Twilio provides the BeFree shortcode and the delivery of the SMS messages for the system, while the Salesforce Service Cloud, a social customer service application, powers the NHTRC’s hotline database. The confidential hotline, operated by Polaris Project, has a network of 2,700 service providers nationwide. Since the hotline began in 2007, the NHTRC has received more than 70,000 calls, connected more than 8,300 victims to assistance and support, and reported more than 3,000 cases to law enforcement. This new initiative furthers the hotline\\'s influence by tapping into a form of communication that many victims already use — texting. \"Based on our experience working directly with survivors of human trafficking, we know that many of them regularly communicate via text,\" Sarah Jakiel, deputy director of Polaris Project, told Mashable. \"Victims are heavily controlled by their exploiters — what they wear, where they go, how much they work, what they eat — but they may be able to send a quick, discreet text message.\" It\\'s also much easier for someone in need in help to remember the shortcode rather than memorizing a 10-digit phone number to dial. With an estimated profit of $32 billion a year, human trafficking is the third largest criminal industry in the world (the first and second being illegal drugs and arms trafficking, respectively). The International Labor Organization estimates that there are 20.9 million victims of human trafficking worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of victims in the United States. The integration of text messages in crisis response has the potential to increase thousands of victims\\' chances of escaping from exploitation. \"When Thorn explained the problem and how important it would be to have texting capability with Polaris\\'s hotline, we didn\\'t hesitate in offering our support,\" Jeff Lawson, co-founder and CEO of Twilio, said. \"This is a problem that affects every level of society — whether it\\'s men or women, adults or children, foreign nationals or U.S. citizens. Anyone from any background can become a victim of trafficking. We are very pleased that we are able to make a difference against this often unmentioned problem facing our society.\" Image via iStockphoto, DougSchneiderPhoto ',\n",
       " ' BARCELONA, Spain — Among the myriad of app companies presenting at ShowStoppers, a show the accompanies Mobile World Congress, Opera had one of the most pragmatic apps.  Opera Max has one goal: to save your bandwidth. It compresses data on its servers before sending to the end user. The company already uses it in its browsers, such as the Opera Mini, but this time, it’s not only web pages that are compressed — it’s also videos, photos and other types of data.  See also: The Comparative Anatomy of the Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4 The app is extremely simple to use. Start it up, and it lingers in the background, saving your data. Unless you’re adamant about experiencing the best possible video and photo quality on your smartphone, we see no reason why you shouldn’t try it out. Opera claims it’ll shave a good 50% of your mobile bandwidth during typical use, and many of us could do well with a lower mobile data bill.  There’s one catch, though — the app is only available for Android. An Opera rep told us the company is looking into developing it for iOS devices as well, but we didn’t get the impression it’ll happen very soon.

       " ' The Twitter chat is one of the best tools for a social media professional to communicate with fans and customers, driving the conversation around the brand. Tuesday\\'s version of existing chat platform Twubs promises to make that job even easier. Twubs, the 5-year-old hashtag platform that aggregates tweets, pics and videos into a branded page, has debuted a free, Twitter API-compliant chat tool. SEE ALSO: 15 Essential Twitter Chats for Social Media Marketers The service, which may remind users of Tweetchat, streams tweets from chats to allow hosts to more effectively moderate the conversation. And because it was built within the guidelines of Twitter\\'s new update to its API, it looks like the add-on won\\'t be targeted by the San Francisco-based company. Twitter has taken issue with other third-party piggyback services in the past, like Tweetchat, which was acquired this week by Internet Media Labs, the maker of the social database site oneQube. \"We take engineering very seriously,\" says Tony Ferraro, Twubs\\' president and CEO. Ferraro told Mashable that his company\\'s proprietary technology, a system which incorporates real-time tweets and adheres to Twitter\\'s new API requirements, is the secret sauce that makes the service effective. Deployed in the Amazon Web Service cloud, Twubs\\' Twitter chat tool is built to handle the large traffic spikes these conversations create. And with chat organizers able to easily create public-branded homepages for their chats, it\\'s built to help foster relationships between hosts and participants. Once created, organizers can add their events to a global calendar to be discovered by new users. And if you\\'re concerned about keeping up with the dialogue on Twitter, the Twubs interface separates host messages from the regular feed, allowing participants to follow along more easily.  “We believe that topic relevancy is the future of social media,” says Ferraro. “Our tools will make it easier for chat participants to engage in the conversation. We have created a separate area above the feed so that host tweets can be clearly identified. This will allow any late-arriving users to immediately understand the discussion topic.\" Chat hosts can even add more than one administrator to a hashtag. And in the interest of security, the host can assign the host role without providing administrative and editing rights. Plus, optional abuse blocking is designed to keep out pesky trolls. Ferraro says the company will be releasing additional features over the next 90 days which, he speculates, will reinvent Twitter chats. Twubs is already used by more than 20,000 companies worldwide, according to Ferraro, who also said that the service processed more than 1 million tweets during the 12-12-12 Sandy Relief Concert, #121212Concert. If Twubs can deliver on its promises, and functionality, it may be the next go-to service for Twitter-using professionals. \"Having a central meeting location, like Twubs, makes community building and archiving chats seamless, discovery of new Twitter chats super simple, eliminating the rolling master Google doc and brings real-time conversations to events,\" explains Lindsay Fultz, the CEO of Middle Child New Media, a social media agency in Los Angeles. Fultz also hosts the weekly #RBChat, focusing on relationship building and networking, both of which she describes as tools to create a \"sense of community amongst the noise and connect like-minded people.\" She says because most Twitter chat moderators work full-time or freelance jobs, a tool like Twubs can help create the all important sense of community seven days per week, and save time by creating \"transcripts from third party apps of the conversations for participants and possible sponsors.\" Kelly Lux, director of social media at Syracuse University\\'s iSchool, and the co-host of #CMGRchat, agrees with Fultz that Twubs could be a hit. She says she\\'s already registered her chat and set up a page. \"I like that you can see who the contributors are, and that people who are looking for a chat can find us,\" says Lux, a fan of any service that can boost the profile of her chat and make it easier for users to follow the conversation. Right now she\\'s watching and waiting to see whether Twubs, or the new iteration of Tweetchat, delivers on promises. \"I would like something with more functionality than the old Tweetchat, and will be looking at these two new services for future chat moderation,\" she says.

       " ' Each social network has its own greatest-hits list. YouTube had \"The Evolution of Dance.\" Facebook seems to generate million-like stories about kids and puppies every other week. Many of Tumblr\\'s most-noted stories feature cats and/or GIFs.  These most-popular stories do not describe everyone\\'s individual experience on these platforms, but you have to admit, they do say something about what\\'s celebrated collectively. They represent the mass-market experience of the social network. So, on the eve of Twitter\\'s initial public offering, we took a look at what Twitter-tracker Favstar says are the most-retweeted tweets of all time (though none is more than a couple years old). This seems like the best metric for measuring Twitter success, given that the network\\'s defining feature is the rapid spread of information. And yes, we understand this list is not totally comprehensive or perfect: for example, it leaves off Barack Obama\\'s re-election tweet, which garnered more than 789,000 retweets. And there are tweets from Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian and a Green Bay football player noted here that should be on the list, but don\\'t change the analysis. So, as a caveat, let\\'s say FavStar is not canonical, but it is instructive. Notably missing from the list: political figures, revolutions, breaking-news events. While most individual Twitter accounts feature a mix of entertainment, news and interpersonal interaction, when you average out the sea of tweets, we find gray platitudes from famous people.  OK, here we go, from No. 12 to No. 1, ranging from roughly 45,000 retweets up to 110,000: 12.

The \"Boy Meets World\" sequel is officially happening! — Ben Savage (@BenSavage) November 26, 2012  As a sophisticated information consumer, this list might not exactly give you hope for the information-sharing potential of social media.  Let\\'s walk through it. Fully half of the tweets are from musicians. Then, we\\'ve got the king of the nerds (Tyson), a footballer (Ronaldo), a former teen icon (Savage), an Instagram parody account (?!), a chain letter in Twitter form and an interesting outlier (the Dropbox ad).  There are a couple things we can say about this list. One, teens dominate the mass movements on Twitter. Their interests (pop music, soccer), concerns (boys/girls) and modes of communication (chain letters) are all over this list. Two, there is an advertisement on this list that was retweeted 56,000 times. That\\'s got to be exciting for marketers, who can imagine duplicating that success at smaller scales and with more targeted audiences.  Since the beginning, Twitter has felt like a hardcore information experience. There is a code to the language (character limits, @-signs, hashtags, retweeting, favoriting, etc). Facebook silences the noisiness of the stream for you; Twitter can\\'t escape it. And even done right, it\\'s felt more like an information-dense utility than entertainment.  Seeing this as a problem, Twitter actively reached out to friendly brands and celebrities. They made the pitch that Twitter was for everyone. Twitter was a way to meet Shaquille O\\'Neal, not just follow a revolution in Tunisia. They added blue lines to make it easier to follow conversations and a discover tab that tries to emulate Facebook\\'s more curated timeline. The whole message has been: Twitter is fun! And easy!  But the more I look at the list above, the more I see that even at this most mass-market level (which is still small relative to Facebook or YouTube), Twitter is for obsessives. Teenage fans, though they might not be Web developers or social media marketers, define obsessive when it comes to learning and talking about the idols they worship. Bieber fever, anyone? Maybe Twitter is made for obsessives, but the content of their obsessions doesn\\'t matter. Maybe instead of casting itself as a simple, fun, easy tool, Twitter should bow to the pressures of its own tool and rebrand for the hardcore experience. Here\\'s the new, more accurate tagline: Twitter: Find Your Obsession.

Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         Hub Since the Shape can function as a normal wireless speaker, the hub is sold separately for $49.99.  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         App Screen An app available on iOS, Android and the web controls the multiple speakers in your house. You can fee different or the same song to various speakers, changing the volume of each independently if you wish.  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         Controls The top of the speaker has controls for wireless connections, outputting sound from a TV and circular touch volume control. There\\'s also an NFC chip on the left for instant pairing with a smartphone.  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         Vertical Placement When the speaker is vertical, it can be used as either a left or right stereo speaker.  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         Connectors The Shape has an Ethernet jack if you prefer a hard-wire connection and a USB port for manual firmware updates (although those can come in wirelessly, too).  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani         Wall Mounting Gear Wall-mounting hardware is sold separately.  Image: Mashable Christina Ascani       Wi-fi connected speakers are finally going mainstream. Samsung\\'s Wi-Fi Shape speaker ($399.99) takes the idea two steps further: It allows for both a multi-room experience (if you have more than one), and it supports Bluetooth and NFC for even more flexibility.  It\\'s a versatile system that sounds and looks great, though the user experience isn\\'t quite as exemplary. Setup is easy enough, particularly with the optional Hub, which sells for an extra $49.99. Without the Hub, an M7 speaker can still be set up on a Wi-Fi network fairly painlessly — though the router needs a Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button to sync up (missing on older Apple AirPorts). See also: 14 iPhone 5 Cases You\\'ll Love Once the speaker is on your network, you control it via smartphone with the downloadable Samsung Multiroom app (Android and iOS). For wired connections, there\\'s an Ethernet port on the back. A USB port is there, too, but it\\'s just for firmware updates. Get Appy The smartphone app functions decently with drag-and-drop ease of use, though it has some rough edges. There\\'s sometimes a delay in response, and there are a few typos (\"To create a new group.Choose some speakers\"). Currently the system supports streaming Internet radio as well as from Amazon Cloud Player, Pandora and Rhapsody. You can also play music from your phone or tablet or your networked PC\\'s music library, the last option powere by Samsung Link.  With the Hub, you can network multiple M7 speakers to allow for all-room synchronized music. You can also have each speaker play songs independently, all controlled via the app. Volume, EQ and mute can also be accessed for each speaker. Touch-sensitive controls glow atop the Shape\\'s mirrored top surface, which also houses the NFC touch point, a mute/power key, and a silver-fringed volume knob.  When connected via Wi-Fi, the speakers sound full and rich, with appropriately deep bass and clear highs. The sound is less impressive when streaming music via Bluetooth, however: the midrange is good, but that\\'s about all. Vocals and rock sound great, but anything with big bass or true highs will be lacking.  Sounds Pretty The M7 speakers are attractively wedge-shaped — the shapes makes them good for sticking in a corner — and can be positioned horizontally or vertically. In the vertical position, a pair of Shapes can serve up stereo sound (again controlled via the app). If you\\'ve got other Samsung gear, the stereo option is especially appealing when you pair the Shapes with a compatible Samsung TV. At nearly 11 pounds, they\\'re light enough to move from room to room, though too bulky to be considered in any way portable. As long as you stick to Wi-Fi listening, the Samsung Shape will give you great sound, but its real power is unlocked when you connect more than one on the same network. That gives you complete control of what you\\'re listening across multiple rooms, all managed from your phone, assuming you can tolerate a couple of app hiccups. With each Shape costing $400, that\\'s not a cheap system, but it\\'s about as convenient as whole-house audio gets. The Lowdown What\\'s Good  Sleek design Polished sound Easy to set up  What\\'s Bad  Wonky app Bluetooth sound is noticeably compressed  Bottom LineSamsung\\'s Shape is a great option for multiroom wireless audio, and although the added flexibility of Bluetooth connectivity detracts from sound quality, it\\'s nice to have the option.

       " ' In an increasingly divisive U.S. political climate, there\\'s at least one cause that has found support on both sides of the aisle — computer science education. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor both stressed the importance of learning to to code, or write computer programs, in videos uploaded Sunday to YouTube by Code.org, a non-profit advocacy group. The joint call to action comes at the start of Computer Science Education Week, which began Monday. See also: Coding the Curriculum: How High Schools Are Reprogramming Their Classes \"If we want America to stay on the cutting edge, we need young Americans like you to master the tools and technology that will change how we do just about everything,\" Obama says in a short video. \"Don\\'t just buy a new video game, make one. Don\\'t just download the latest app, help design it. Don\\'t just play on your phone, program it.\"  Cantor, who often plays the role of political adversary to Obama, backed the President\\'s sentiment. \"America is the land of opportunity. We have so much before us — so many challenges to overcome and problems to solve,\" Cantor says. \"Coding is the necessary tool of this century to best do that.\" Cantor goes on to say that learning to code is as important as learning language and math: \"It is the only way for you to prepare for the future.\"   Additionally, 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich appears in a Code.org video promoting the Hour of Code campaign as \"a great, free, voluntary opportunity\" to \"make sure that every American understands a lot more about computing.\" In October, Code.org announced its \"Hour of Code\" campaign, which aimed to \"demystify computer science\" for 10 million grade school students by exposing them to introductory concepts for at least an hour during Computer Science Education Week. Hadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, told Mashable in an email that some 35,000 teachers and 5 million students from around the world signed up to participate. \"Today is when 5 million students begin learning to code, with support from athletes, celebrities, politicians, world leaders and all the top websites of the world,\" Partovi wrote. In addition to the political attention, Code.org has garnered support from celebrities and tech industry leaders. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Miami Heat player Chris Bosh, actor Ashton Kutcher and pop singers Shakira and Will.I.Am are among the prominent figures who have appeared in Code.org videos endorsing computer science education.  U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan explains the significance of Computer Science Education Week in another video uploaded to Code.org\\'s YouTube page on Sunday. The initiative is timed to correspond with the birthdate of computing pioneer Grace Murray Hopper (subject of Monday\\'s Google Doodle), who was born on Dec. 9, 1906, and died in 1992.  Image: U.S. Navy Hopper earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Yale University and served in the U.S. Navy, helping to develop the earliest computers and design programming languages. After joining the Naval Reserves in 1943, Hopper eventually reached the rank of Rear Admiral in 1985. Duncan also discusses why he believes computer science education is important for U.S. students. \"Our children will need computer science so that they can learn how to use that knowledge in problem solving,\" Duncan says. \"They will need to be able to code and they will need some understanding of algorithms, software engineering, big data, cyber security and the limits of what computers can do.\" Economics appears to be the driving force behind politicians\\' unified support of computer programming education. A Code.org report suggests the demand for computer science employees in the U.S. could exceed the number of students who take up the subject by 1 million by 2020.

       " ' UPDATE: Congress has approved a bill to reopen the U.S. government, and avoid default, raising the debt ceiling until Feb. 7, according to the Associated Press Senate leadership announced a bipartisan deal to reopen the government and avoid default on Wednesday — day 16 of the government shutdown and the eve of the debt ceiling deadline. The deal isn\\'t yet official as the U.S. House of Representatives still must vote on the Senate-approved plan, but a Democratic aide told Reuters that both parties are confident it will pass. See also: 21 Reliable Sources to Follow on Twitter for Debt Ceiling News What does this deal mean for the nation\\'s economy, furloughed workers — and the Panda Cam?  1. What is the debt ceiling? The United States debt ceiling, also know as the debit limit, is the maximum amount of money the government may borrow. It\\'s a legislative mechanism designed to cap the amount of debt the Treasury can issue.  Congress set its first debt ceiling in 1917 leading up to World War I. Prior to that, the government issued debt limits for specific purposes, such as building the Panama Canal, but a war with unknowable costs called for a general limit: $5 billion limit for all new bonds. At the beginning of 2013, the limit was $16.394 trillion, but a 3-month suspension of the limit allowed it to climb to $16.699 trillion in May.  2. What does this latest deal in Congress mean? The U.S. actually reached the debt limit on May 19. Since then, the Treasury used \"extraordinary measures,\" such as suspending some investments, to make sure it didn\\'t surpass the limit. The Treasury estimated those measures would have been exhausted this week. Wednesday\\'s deal gives the U.S. borrowing authority until Feb. 7. Of course, that\\'s also not a doomsday deadline — much like how the Treasury used alternative measures to avoid a default since May, they could use those extraordinary measures again if Congress fails to act next year. 3. Did the deal end the government shutdown? Wednesday\\'s deal also provides funding for all government operations through Jan. 15. There is no timeline, but with funding available, it\\'s possible for workers to get back on the job, for national parks to reopen and for the National Zoo\\'s Panda Cam to go live again. 4. What does all of this mean for \"Obamacare\"? In his remarks on the deal, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — who made headlines for his 21-hour filibuster before a vote on a government spending bill which would defund Obamacare — said the plan does not affect the Affordable Care Act. (\"Obamacare\" and the Affordable Care Act are one and the same.) 5. Is there a new debt ceiling deadline? Yes. Congress must act before Feb. 7 to avoid the possibility of defaulting again. 6. Why does this keep happening? U.S. debt is issued when the revenue coming into the country isn\\'t enough to pay for what we\\'ve purchased. Since the nation\\'s income continues to be less than its spending, debt increases, and new debt ceilings are forever encroached upon.  You never hear about this happening in other developed nations because the vast majority of countries don\\'t have debt ceilings. 7. What happens if we default? Simply put, defaulting means that the government doesn\\'t have money to pay its bills. Without the authority to borrow, some domestic payments could go unfunded, possibly affecting Social Security benefits, Medicare reimbursements and military pay. Tony James, president and chief operating officer of the Blackstone Group, told CBS News that a default would be \"Armageddon,\" predicting that the U.S. stock market would plummet. The value of the dollar would likely decrease, and global markets could be impacted, especially ones with a large stake in the U.S. Treasury, such as China, which holds $1.28 trillion in securities.  8. Wouldn\\'t cutting spending fix the problem? In short, no. The money the U.S. owes is for items already purchased, so cuts to spending would not reduce anything.  In Wednesday\\'s deal, Republicans got Democrats to agree to \"have spending in one area of the budget decline for two years in a row,\" according to the Associated Press. However, that was just part of the larger negotiation to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling and will serve as a means to curb future debt.

       " '  Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder and co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will host an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit today, beginning at 1:45 p.m. Eastern Time. Gates gave Reddit a heads-up a little early today, announcing the AMA at about 12:40 p.m. EST, including a photo of him holding a stick-drawn figure of himself next to the Reddit icon. He also posted a short YouTube video with his answers to \"popular\" Reddit questions. His publicist confirmed that Gates would begin answering questions around 1:45 p.m.  Gates kicked things off by answering a question about the open Internet at recent pushes against it, such as SOPA, the long-dead Stop Online Piracy Act:  The Internet has benefited from having lots of free stuff and lots of commercial software. It has been interesting see people inventing hybrid models. Even stuff that is pretty commercial often has free versions for some audiences. Even the most open stuff often have services people choose to pay for. The second thing is the anonymous versus identified tension. This is another one where both will probably thrive since you want anonymity for some things and full identity for others. I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.  Gates, who still ranks among the world\\'s richest people, talked about the \"cheapest\" thing that gives him the most pleasure: Kids. Cheap cheeseburgers. Open Course Ware courses... On where he gets the \"cheap kids\" from: The stork. On the Microsoft project that got away: We had a rich database as the client/cloud store that was part of a Windows release that was before its time. This is an idea that will remerge since your cloud store will be rich with schema rather than just a bunch of files and the client will be a partial replica of it with rich schema understanding. (Gates also confirmed it was called WinFS.) On his relationship with Steve Jobs: He and I respected each other. Our biggest joint project was the Mac where Microsoft had more people on the project than Apple did as we wrote a lot of applications. I saw Steve regularly over the years including spending an afternoon with him a few months before he tragically passed away... On what emerging technology he sees as potentially disruptive as the PC: Robots, pervasive screens, speech interaction will all change the way we look at \"computers\". Once seeing, hearing, and reading (including handwriting) work very well you will interact in new ways... On Bing vs. Google search: Seriously Bing is the better product at this point. Try the challenge. I am biased but the work to make Bing better has been amazing. On leaving his children \"only\" $10 million: I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them. Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him and it made me think about it and decide he was right. Some people disagree with this but Melinda and I feel good about it. On what world problem needs solving, but not with money: It would be nice if all governments were as rational as the Nordic governments - reaching compromise and providing services broadly. The Economist had a nice special section on this last week. Africa governments have often been weak but you can\\'t write a check to change that. Fortunately the average quality is going up. Mo Ibrahim tracks this in a great way. On whether or not he still codes: Not as much as I would like to. I write some C, C# and some Basic. I am surprised new languages have not made more progress in simplifying programming. It would be great if most high school kids were exposed to programming... About the computer he\\'s using right now: I just got my Surface Pro a week ago and it is very nice. I am using a Perceptive Pixel display right now - huge Windows 8 touch whiteboard. These will come down in price over time and be pervasive... On what people give him for his birthday: Free software. Just kidding. Books actually. On his favorite book: My favorite of the last decade in Pinker\\'s Better Angels of our Nature. It is long but profound look at the reduction in violence and discrimination over time. I review a lot of the books I read at gatesnotes.com (is that too self-promotional?) On whether he still jumps over chairs, which he once demonstrated he can do from a standing position: Less than I used to. It was part of exercise for snow skiing. I still ski but I am not as hard core... On what he would have done if Microsoft hadn\\'t worked out: If the microprocessor had NOT come along I am not sure what I would have done. Maybe medicine or theoretical math but it is hard to say. On with worldwide health problems are most immediately solvable: Polio is the first thing to get done since we are close. Within 6 years we will have the last case. After that we will go after malaria and measles. Malaria kills over 500,000 kids every year mostly in Africa and did not get enough attention until the last decade. We also need vaccines to prevent HIV and TB which are making progress... On violence against health care workers in parts of Asia and Africa: The violence against the vaccinators in both Pakistan and Nigeria is a terrible thing. However both countries are committed to finishing the eradication. This is the project I spent most of my time on. We should be able to finish by 2018 although that will require raising funds and some great execution. We have some innovations like the way we use satellite maps to find all the villages and GPS tracking to make sure the teams go to every hut that are helping out. Polio is a harder disease than smallpox was but it is doable. (I discuss this more at www.billsletter.com) On other philanthropists: I have enjoyed meeting other philanthropists and talking about what they work on. I think there is a movement to do more, start sooner and be smarter about giving. Philanthropy is mostly about a broad set of people giving but it helps if the most wealthy set a strong example... On how he measures success of his foundation: Our goals are focused on helping the poorest (globally) and improving education (in the US). We spend half of our money on global health. One metric to look at is reducing the number of children (under 5) who die. My annual letter talks about the amazing progress that has been made on this. Amazingly as health improves families choose to have less kids so paradoxically population growth goes DOWN as you improve health helping with almost every issue — from stability to the environment. On his favorite band: Weezer.... Actually U2 is a favorite.. I keep waiting for Spinal Tap to go back on tour... On his foundation\\'s greatest achievement: So far our biggest impact has been getting vaccines for things like diarrhea and pneumonia out which has saved millions of lives. Polio will be a great achievement along with key partners when that gets done. On the anti-vaccine movement in the U.S.: Vaccines are very important in all countries. Some of the bad rumors have lead to kids dying of measles and pertussis. We have backed some information campaigns on the importance of vaccination even in the US. On his worst fear for the future:  Hopefully we won\\'t have terrorists using nuclear weapons or biological weapons. We should make sure that stays hard. I am disappointed more isn\\'t being done to reduce carbon emissions. Governments need to spend more on basic energy R&D to make sure we get cheap non-CO2 emitting sources as soon as possible.Overall I am pretty optimistic. Things are a lot better than they were 200 years ago...  On what he does for fun: I love playing tennis. I am an avid bridge player (a card game if you have not heard of it - it was more popular in the past!). I like to tour interesting things with my kids like power plants, garbage dumps, the Large Hadron Collider, Antarctica, missile Silos (Arizona)... I read a lot and watch courses (online or the Learning Company)... On how he feels about his portrayal in Pirates of Silicon Valley: That portrayal was reasonably accurate... On what\\'s left on his bucket list: Don\\'t die... On health challenges in India: India is making progress but there is still a lot to do particularly up in the North. They still need to add some of the vaccines that poorer countries are already using and saving lots of lives. India did a great job on polio and is increasing the health budget. We work closely with the federal and state governments to help out... On Windows 7 vs. Windows 8: Higher is better. On the world\\'s dependence on oil: I did a TED talk about the climate crisis. Over time we have to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions so using fossil fuels will require us to do carbon capture and sequestration. There has been far too little work on this.

       " ' What started with a disturbing revelation has turned into full-blown scandal for the Obama administration and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Last month, reports emerged from the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System that 40 veterans died while waiting on a secret list for appointments that was designed to hide the length of the official waiting list. The dominos then began to fall.\\xa0The Daily Beast reported on severely long waiting lists for patients at a New Mexico facility, where in some cases veterans suffering from cardiac-related illnesses were waiting eight months to get ultrasounds. See also: 5 Things to Know About the Most Powerful Woman in Health Care* Then an audit team from the VA\\'s Office of Inspector General went to Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida, only to discover a similar list of patients that were kept on paper instead of on the VA\\'s computer system. Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin revealed 10 new wait-time incidents and problems at veteran healthcare facilities during a Senate committee meeting last week, and now\\xa0a spokeswoman from the inspector general\\'s office confirmed that a new total of 26 facilities are being investigated nationwide. During a Wednesday press conference on the growing VA scandal, President Barack Obama addressed the accusations that some VA workers had manipulated data to make it appear as though wait times were better than the reality. \"If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it, period,\" Obama said. “That’s the thing that most disturbs me about the report, the fact that folks intentionally withheld information that could have helped us fix the problem. Problems can be fixed, but folks have to let the people they’re reporting to know that there is a problem.”  This is Obama’s \\'Mad Face\\' -> pic.twitter.com/TNnq8ucNHX — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) May 21, 2014  The White House has launched multiple investigations into the backlog coverup, and has aimed the investigations at the VA as a whole, not just the facilities in Arizona, Florida and New Mexico where there are already reported problems. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors will conduct a review of the VA\\'s healthcare system as a whole, while the inspector general\\'s office will look into whether other facilities have cooked the books with regard to VA backlogs. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki will conduct a similar investigation. Many have called for Shinseki\\'s resignation, but Obama stood by him at the press conference. “Nobody cares more about our veterans than Eric Shinseki,\" Obama said, using the retired general\\'s nickname. “He has put his heart and soul in this thing and he has taken it very seriously.” Obama acknowledged that many people have called for a quick and decisive response to the allegations, but said investigations take time. He also said people should keep in mind that VA backlogs have been an issue for years. The preliminary results of Shinseki\\'s investigation are due next week, according to the president. “I want to know what’s working, I want to know what is not working and I want specific recommendations on how the VA can up their game,\" Obama said.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' Google said Thursday it will shut down its Google News service in Spain to prevent publishers\\' content from appearing on it — ahead of a new law requiring the Internet search company to pay Spanish news organizations for linked content or snippets of news. The move marks the first time globally that Google will shutter Google News and comes ahead of a new Spanish intellectual property law going into effect Jan. 1 nicknamed the \"Google Tax.\" See also: Spain May Require Aggregators to Pay for Using Article Links The company\\'s News product for Spain will stop linking content from Spanish publishers and close on Dec. 16, Google said in a statement. The law did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google. Spain\\'s AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law nicknamed the \"Google Tax\" and Google said publishers would be forced to charge the company \"for showing even the smallest snippets of their content — whether they want to charge or not.\" \"As Google News shows no ads and makes no revenue, this approach is simply unsustainable,\" Google said. Google News has long rankled newspaper publishers and other content providers who contend the service tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites. Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts. Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services. The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads. After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did. Europe\\'s highest court this year ruled that people have a right to scrub unflattering or outdated information from Google\\'s search engine. That case started in Spain. ',\n",
       " ' When OS X Yosemite ships this fall, Apple will stop development of Aperture, its photo editing program aimed and professionals and advanced users. Instead, the company will work with users to transition to Photos, an application previewed at WWDC 2014. See also: With OS X Yosemite, the Mac Comes of Age The news of Aperture\\'s imminent demise first appeared on Tech Crunch. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the development to Mashable: \"With the introduction of the new Photos app and iCloud Photo Library, enabling you to safely store all of your photos in iCloud and access them from anywhere, there will be no new development of Aperture. When Photos for OS X ships next year, users will be able to migrate their existing Aperture libraries to Photos for OS X.\" Current Aperture users don\\'t need to worry, the program will get updates to work under OS X Yosemite. Still, active development of the app will end. Introduced in 2005, Aperture\\'s original audience was professional or advanced photographers. With Aperture, DSLR users gained support for raw image support from a variety of camera vendors, the ability to do tethered-shooting and a variety of non-destructive image editing tools. If Final Cut Pro was the professional version of iMovie, Aperture was the professional version of iPhoto. Aperture was released at a time when the professional and prosumer DSLR market was really starting to heat up. Originally priced at $499, Aperture gained a loyal early audience because it was a tool built for digital photographers. Unlike Photoshop — which had evolved into a robust graphics package, Aperture allowed photographers to just focus on photos.  Aperture 2.0 was released in 2008 for $199 and it went head-to-head with Adobe\\'s competing Lightroom application.  In 2010, Apple released Aperture 3.0. Since then, the application has received numerous updates, including support for iCloud, Facebook and Flickr.  With the introduction of the Mac App Store in 2011, Apple reduced the price of Aperture to $79.99. It should be noted that Apple has continued to update RAW support for various cameras for Aperture and iPhoto, but Aperture itself hasn\\'t received any significant user-interface updates since 2010.  Adobe steps in for advanced users At the same time, Adobe\\'s Lightroom — which battled Aperture during the Aperture 2/early Aperture 3 era — has surpassed Aperture in terms of both update frequency and features. Aperture 3.0 and Lightroom 3.0 were both released in 2010. Since then, however, Adobe has continued to update Lightroom. Lightroom 5.0 was released in 2013 and is available to users as part of Adobe\\'s Creative Cloud or as a stand-alone product. Adobe also released versions of Lightroom Mobile for iPad and iPhone earlier this spring. Every photographer I know who used to swear by Aperture, switched to Adobe around the time Lightroom 3.0 was released. For its part, Adobe says it is committed to making Lightroom better and better. On a blog post responding to Apple\\'s decision to retire Aperture, the company wrote: Put simply, we\\'re doubling down on our investments in Lightroom and the new Creative Cloud Photography plan and you can expect to see a rich roadmap of rapid innovation for desktop, web and device workflows in the coming weeks, months and years. We also continue to invest actively on the iOS and OSX platforms, and are committed to helping interested iPhoto and Aperture customers migrate to our rich solution across desktop, device and web workflows. Adobe offers a special Creative Cloud subscription bundle for Photographers for $10 a month. That bundle includes access to both Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, as well as cloud-storage and sync between desktop and mobile apps. iPhoto also gets the boot The new Photos app for OS X Yosemite will also replace iPhoto. iPhoto has received more updates and significant user overhauls over the last few years (unlike Aperture), but it makes little sense to have Photos and iPhoto. Based on the preview shown at WWDC, Photos for OS X will be more of a hybrid between iPhoto and Aperture, but with an added focus on working well with the iCloud Photo Library. So what does that mean for iPhoto for iOS? Apple hasn\\'t made any announcements about the app — but its incompatibility with iOS 8 (for now) makes us think it is likely the app will be replaced with something else later this fall. iPhoto for iOS has always struck me as an app that was more professional than iPhoto for Mac, but not quite as powerful as something like Aperture. It\\'s a good app — great at times even — but in recent years, I\\'ve found myself using other photo apps on iOS rather than iPhoto, simply because they have better workflow management and (ironically) faster cloud support. Aperture users have options Although I feel bad for any Aperture user who just purchased the application — this news shouldn\\'t come as a surprise to any longtime user. Apple has overhauled its professional apps, namely Final Cut Pro and Logic in recent years, but Aperture hasn\\'t had an under-the-hood update in years. Moreover, as more and more users turn to the iPhone as their primary camera, and not a DSLR, it doesn\\'t necessarily makes sense for Apple to focus on the professional imaging market. Especially when competitors such as Capture One and Lightroom exist. Making Aperture even more redundant, those applications support importing from Aperture/iPhoto libraries. Plus, Apple will make it possible to use and access edits using Photos for OS X, in the event that you don\\'t want to move nine years worth of photos to a new program. I wrote about Aperture 3\\'s release (in the Apple Store — not to be confused with the Mac App Store) back in February 2010. I paid $99 to upgrade from version 2.0.  As someone who shifted to Lightroom in 2012, I can\\'t say I don\\'t feel as if I got my money\\'s worth for nearly five years of updates. Frankly, the photo book I created in 2008 for Mother\\'s Day using Aperture 2.0 was worth the price ten times over. It\\'s understandable that veteran users will be upset by the news, but the good news is the app will work under Yosemite. It just won\\'t get future development. Hopefully in time, users can find a replacement that works for them. I use Lightroom and it fills my needs and then some. I look forward to using Photos for my iPhone-related photo tasks. If you\\'re an Aperture or former-Aperture user, let us know what you plan to do in the comments. ',\n",

       " '     Let me repeat: I drove a 3D printed car. It wasn’t for long, and it wasn’t far, but it was a singularly awesome experience. The car, known as the Strati, is perhaps the world’s fully drivable, almost completely 3D printer-manufactured automobile.  Local Motors used crowd-sourced design and a custom-built 3D printer to create the one-of-a-kind (for now) 3D printed car and assembled it over six days at the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) in Chicago, Illinois a few weeks ago.  See also: Three Robots Built This 3D-Printed Hut The company brought the two-seater to New York on Tuesday and I took it for a tiny, yet memorable, test drive. In person Clad in a black-and-white leather racing jacket, perfectly worn jeans, and with chiseled features that would look equally at home in a race car or box of Wheaties (at one point I accidentally called him “Steve Rogers” – look it up), Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers greets me with a wide grin and a firm handshake. Behind him is the car.  The all-gray Strati is somewhat larger than I expected. It sits low to the ground like a race car and features just two custom leather seats. On parts of the body, you can clearly see the printed layers, in others, the Strati has been milled to smooth perfection. The body feels, well, like plastic, but also extremely solid. It has race-car lines, but also a custom-built quality. Rogers tells me that there are 227 printed layers in the chassis and the only limit was the 3D printer. Eventually, Local Motors expects to use larger 3D printers to print even bigger cars (can you say “3D-printed SUV?).

Getting Ready to Drive 3D Printed Car           3D Printed Car Under the Hood We peel back the flap to get a good look at the \"engine.\"          3D Printed Car Motor The Strati motor is pretty small.          3D Printed Car Battery It weighs 120 lbs.          Local Motors Strati 3D Printed Car           3D Printed Car Blinkers           3D Printed Car Seats Red and comfortable.          3D Printed Car Shock Absorbers           3D Printed Car Wiring           3D Printed Car Tire It\\'s actually a motorcycle tire.       I notice that the printing on the fender is vertical instead of horizontal. Rogers explains that Local Motors decided to print the fenders separately. This way, if they’re damaged, you don’t have to replace (read reprint) the entire chassis, he adds. Rogers gestures toward the interior of the car and points out the red leather seats, which he says Local Motors built and upholstered and noted that the ultimate goal is to provide a sort of fly net or weave-style seating that can be snapped into place on a pre-printed base.  As we’re looking at the interior, I notice two compartments in front of the passenger seat. They were, Rogers says, printed as spots for storage — just like a real car. Strike that. This is a real car. I take note of the large Bridgestone Battlax wheels, which turn out to be motorcycle tires. Then we walk around the back and Rogers unsnaps a vinyl flap to reveal a small Renault Twizy Motor. It sits behind a much larger 120 pound battery.  Hop in  When it’s time to get inside the Strati 3D printed car, Rogers guides me. “Right leg first and turn your knee to the right to get it under the steering wheel.” I seem unable to turn my leg that way, so I lift my right leg and point my knee sharply to the left to squeeze it under the small steering wheel and dash. Rogers smiles and says, “That’ll work.” Even though this is a printed car, it doesn’t give the impression of a kit or even cheaply made automobile. The leather-clad steering wheel feels solid in my hands. There’s a tiny dash display for speed and nestled to the left and somewhat behind the steering wheel is a set of three buttons with the letters DNR. D is drive, N is neutral and R is reverse. I note blinker controls on the wheel column, but not a lot else. There’s room enough for my legs, though I can’t fully stretch them out. The seat does not move back or forward. I can’t quite see it, but my right foot finds the brake and acceleration peddles.  “Put your foot on the brake,” says Rogers, sounding a lot like my first driving instructor. “Now press the D button and then put your foot on the acceleration peddle.”  I start to do this, but hesitate. There is no sound. I mean, literally, nothing coming from the Strati engine. Is this car even on? At first, I press so lightly that the car doesn’t even move. Then, with still no sound, the car starts gliding forward. The Local Motors 3D printed car can travel up to 50 miles per hour, but early models like this one, which will go on sale sometime in the next 12 months, are set to feature factory-limited motors and batteries so they can’t travel more than roughly 25 miles per hour. This will make them neighborhood safe, which also means there’s no requirement for many of the safety features you come to expect in most modern cars. So no seatbelts (at least that I could find) and no air bags.  Rogers tells me that Local Motors plans to work on making the cars street legal and if you buy one next year for roughly $18,000 and an upgrade becomes available, they’ll simply take back the fully recyclable chassis and print you a new, delimited, 3D printed car that can reach 50 miles per hour. In my short ride I barely went above 5 miles per hour, but I still noticed the ultra-smooth ride and relatively tight steering (there’s no power steering). You’re also very low to the ground. I could imagine that this is what it might feel like to cruise around New York City in a race car. For the delicate maneuver of driving the Strati 3D printed car back into the transport trailer, Rogers takes over. I sit in the passenger seat and we mount the ramp and roll inside. Even that maneuver felt smooth as butter and, to be honest, oddly thrilling. As Rogers and his crew finish securing the car inside the trailer, a small crowd gathers. People can tell there’s something different and special about this car. Rogers smiles and patiently answers questions from passersby. I watch and wonder if he’ll give me one more ride and if I could possibly borrow that awesome jacket. ',\n",
       " ' Traveling by bus is often cheap, but it can be a pain to organize trips across long distances. Wanderu, the booking service that provides travelers with bus and train itineraries across companies, is expanding its coverage to hundreds of destinations in the midwestern United States. \"The midwest is the last piece of the puzzle,\" Wanderu CEO and founder Polina Raygorodskaya told Mashable. See also: 26 weird museums to visit for the ultimate American road trip Although buses lack glamour, bus travel is often the best option for U.S. travelers on a budget. According to a recent study by DePaul University (for which Wanderu contributed data), 73% of bus travelers are between 18 and 35 years old. A roundtrip ticket on a bus from Indianapolis to Chicago can be as cheap as $56, even last minute, according to Wanderu. By contrast, roundtrip airfare between the same cities varies from $214 to $488 for the next month.  Image: Flickr, Richard BauerCheap prices aren\\'t the only reason young people choose to take a bus, according to Wanderu. \"With ground travel, the destination is only half of the experience,\" the company stated in a blog post Wednesday. \"Being able to look out the window at the great expanses of farmland and lakes is picturesque to say the least.\" Raygorodskaya and cofounder Igor Bratnikov started their company in 2012 after finding themselves stranded on a cross-country trip originally intended to be completed with ride-shares. \"We spent about an hour trying to see if we could map out our trip — we ended up having to rent a car,\" Raygorodskaya said. \"Despite the fact that buses were the most convenient way for me to travel, the booking process was a complete headache,\" she added. \"If I\\'m somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and I require more than one connection, it was impossible to figure that out.\" The various bus companies often have websites, but it can be difficult to find connections between cities and carriers, and many of the sites were impossible to use on mobile. Raygorodskaya said an easy-to-use mobile booking experience was a high priority. Wanderu includes routes with well-known bus companies like Greyhound and Megabus, in addition to smaller regional carriers like Peoria Charter Bus or Turimex — both new partners with the midwest expansion.  A search for a midwest route between two universities which requires a routed trip of two bus companies.Image:  WanderuTo find the most convenient transportation options, Raygorodskaya suggests travelers look for routed trips — with one or more connections — to find cheaper and even faster options than long-distance direct trips. Whether or not bus travel will expand beyond its budget-travel reputation remains to be seen. In the meantime, younger travelers with limited budgets will likely continue to use them to get where they need to go. ',\n",

       " ' The reason why meningitis seems to strike during the teen years may be that teens\\' bodies are more likely to carry a chemical that fuels the growth of the bacteria that cause meningitis, according to a new study. In the study, the researchers discovered that the bacteria species that causes meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, contains a cluster of genes that allows it to use a compound called propionic acid for growth. Propionic acid, in turn, is generated by other bacteria that become more common in the human body during adolescence, said James Moir, a researcher at the University of York in England and one of the researchers on the study. Meningitis is a swelling or inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord (which are called the meninges). When bacteria cause this swelling, the condition is known as bacterial meningitis. Causes of bacterial meningitis can vary depending on a person\\'s age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Neisseria meningitidis is a common cause of bacterial meningitis among teens and young adults, and infection often happens when the bacteria from a respiratory infection enter the bloodstream. About 10% of people carry Neisseria meningitidis in their nose and throats without having symptoms, and such \"colonization\" peaks in the late teen years, the researchers said. SEE ALSO: 7 Absolutely Horrible Head Infections The increase in Neisseria meningitidis in teens\\' noses and throats is often attributed to the increase in social interaction and close contact in this age group (such as living in a college dorm), the researchers said. While there is \"no doubt\" that this explanation is true, the new study provides another explanation for why colonization with Neisseria meningitidis varies with age, the researchers said.

       " ' Last year, the Internet opened up the doors on generic top level domains (gTLDs), letting anyone create their own \".anything\" space on the web — provided they pony up $185,000. Now those generic domains have passed their first big milestone. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced that there are now 100 generic TLDs that have been \"delegated,\" one of the final steps before the domains can begin taking registrations. Among the new domains are .rich, .sexy, .ninja, .pink, .email, .buzz, .coffee and .domains. ICANN has posted the full list, along with the names of all the registrants. See also: iOS 7 Apps: Download These Now Many of the registrants are relatively new registry companies created specifically to harvest and manage gTLDs. United TLD Holdco, for example, registered seven domains; United is part of Rightside, which plans to roll out a \"domain name services platform.\" Another domain registry called Donuts bought some of the domains, such as .cab, via subsidiaries. Donuts says it has raised more then $100 million from various investors to create new business around the domains. Although none of the company names are well-known, Google is represented by its domain-name registrar company, Charleston Road Registry. The sole domain it has on the list of 100 is a Japanese-character name, the Japanese word for \"everyone.\" Google (through Charleston) actually has several gTLD applications pending, including .google, .android, .youtube and even .tech, although those haven\\'t reached the delegation stage yet. By comparison, Apple has just one application, for .apple. Microsoft has applied for .microsoft, .bing, .skype and .docs, among others.

       " ' One of the world\\'s most solemn institutions recently met one of the web\\'s silliest sites — seriously. Justices and GIFs came together when, for the first time, a Tumblr page featured prominently in a brief presented to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Harvard Law professor and political activist Lawrence Lessig created the “Corruption,\" originally. Tumblr as what he called the centerpiece of a brief he submitted in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case (.PDF), a challenge to current campaign contribution limits.  See also: Watch Interns Sprint to Deliver Supreme Court Decisions Lessig used the Tumblr page to aggregate his survey of how the framers of the U.S. Constitution used the word \"corruption.\" The page catalogues 325 uses of the word by figures such as George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Mason and Patrick Henry.   \"The basic argument of the brief is that the Framers of the Constitution used the word \\'corruption\\' in a different, more inclusive way, than we do today,\" Lessig blogged earlier this week. In the same post, Lessig called this the first ever use of Tumblr in an argument submitted to the Supreme Court. In the case, Shaun McCutcheon, an Alabama businessman, and the Republican National Committee argue that current aggregate limits on campaign contribution from individuals are unconstitutionally low, in violation of the First Amendment.  McCutcheon\\'s argument is that individuals should be able to contribute more in total — not necessarily to individual candidates but to various campaigns, political party committees and political action committees. And since contribution limits to individual candidates and groups would remain intact,  increasing the limit for aggregate donations would not increase corruption in the form of people paying politicians for favors.   Lessig, an avid advocate for campaign finance reform, takes issue with McCutcheon\\'s assertion. \"McCutcheon’s argument, however, depends upon a modern understanding of the term \\'corruption,\\' in sharp conflict with the term’s original meaning,\" reads Lessig\\'s brief. \"The Framers viewed corruption as one of the greatest threats to government.\" The modern focus of corruption, according to Lessing, is what he calls \"quid pro quo\" corruption, which focuses on the direct exchange of resources for favors between individuals and groups.  Lessig, who founded the campaign finance reform-focused Rootstrikers movement, is attempting to prove that aggregate campaign contribution limits protect against \"institutional corruption,\" a chief concern among the framers. He made his case in the aforementioned blog post. And one prominent example of the institutional corruption they were concerned about was an institution developing an improper dependence. Like — to pick just one totally random example — a Congress developing a dependence upon its funders, rather than the dependence the framers intended — “on the People alone.” By using the exact words of the founding fathers of the constitution, Lessig is appealing to the \"textualist\" or \"originalist\" justices — those who base their decisions strictly on its text. The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case on Oct. 8. It\\'s worth noting that Lessig\\'s Tumblr eschews GIF use altogether, in fact the entire page is absent of images. Perhaps he doesn\\'t understand how to unlock the full power of the medium, or maybe he thought the Supreme Court just isn\\'t ready for that yet. The jury\\'s still out.

Since it\\'s difficult to tell when someone is recording a video or taking pictures with Google Glass, it makes sense that club owners would preemptively ban the gadget. Image via iStockphoto, BreatheFitness           3. Movie Theaters  Bootlegging is a big issue in movie theaters, and Google Glass would only exacerbate copyright issues. That\\'s why, under Regal Entertainment Group\\'s admittance procedures, the device is already banned. Besides, how would you wear your 3D glasses? Image via iStockphoto, Deklofenak           4.

Certain Bars and Businesses  Soon after Google Glass was announced, a Seattle bar declared it would ban the device on its premises, with other businesses possibly following suit.

While Google Glass is only available to a limited number of Explorers, you\\'re not supposed to let uncertified people use it. Google has officially banned lending and reselling the gadget.

       " ' \"Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.\" That line, often misattributed to Mark Twain, used to mean something in the glory days of newspapers. Ink was a scarce commodity, as were presses and trucks; you couldn\\'t very well print or distribute as many copies of your version of the facts as the New York Times could.  Electrons, however, are the opposite of scarce. In the era of social media, you have just as many potential listeners for your argument as those ink-slinging hacks, especially if you\\'re futuristic entrepreneur extraordinaire. And so it was that Elon Musk, normally a very cautious interviewee, decided to fire indiscriminately at the New York Times when it published an account of breaking down in a Tesla Model S between charging stations. In particular, Musk threw a word that is kryptonite to any self-respecting journalist: \"fake.\" The Grey Lady was never going to stand for that, especially not when the memory of Jayson Blair still rankles.  Battle broke out in earnest when Tesla published a post revealing logs from the writer\\'s journey. It reached fever pitch on Thursday, with the Times publishing multiple reasoned responses to Tesla\\'s logs — proving that the sheer weight of its words can still beat those of a corporate opponent, even if the price of ink is no longer the main reason. It is unclear at this stage how Tesla can win this he-said-they-said battle, not to mention the larger PR war. Musk has made a number of unforced errors. The logs he published were no knockout punch and the Times is responding methodically to each charge. And at every step, potential customers are receiving constant reminders of a single undisputed moment in the story: a Tesla Model S in the bitter cold, out of juice, on the back of a flatbed truck. Tesla\\'s Troubles This is a precarious time for Tesla. The electric car maker badly needs a hit product. It ran out of parts to build the Roadster in 2012. The Model S is an undeniably awesome award-winning car, and most of its users rave about how it gives you a real 21st century thrill to drive it. But among would-be buyers, questions persist about charging stations: how easy they are to find; how fast they are to use.  Disproportionately, those would-be buyers are among the above average income-earning, left-leaning readers of the New York Times. And for non-readers — well, the Grey Lady\\'s word on something can still become a national story, even in this age of electrons.  You can see why Musk felt he had to fire back, even at the risk of making it a larger story. The reputation of the Model S, which only started rolling off the factory floor in June, is at stake. This is the kind of defining moment that consumers remember.  Musk was also once-bitten, twice-angry. The UK TV show Top Gear filmed a segment in 2008 that left the impression a Tesla Roadster had lost its charge after 55 miles. It hadn\\'t, and the presenter Jeremy Clarkson is an over-the-top character full of anti-electric car opinions, so Musk sued. And lost, largely because Top Gear is an entertainment show.  Musk\\'s first unforced error, therefore, was conflating Top Gear and the New York Times. As far as standards, ethics and outlook go, they couldn\\'t be further apart. Big Tesla is Watching You The second error flows from the first:   Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 11, 2013  Would you buy a computer if you knew the manufacturer could keep tabs on exactly how you used it? What about if they said they needed your permission first? How would you feel if you read a story where the reviewer didn\\'t like the machine, and then the company revealed they\\'d been tracking how the reviewer used it all along? Even those of us who don\\'t have so many concerns about privacy in a world that\\'s full of high-tech trails — myself included — have to admit the situation doesn\\'t look good for Tesla. There\\'s a certain Big Brother vengefulness to this behavior. It has already become a meme on Twitter. Take this Back to the Future joke:  Doc Brown says Tesla ran out of charge before he could hit 88 mph; Tesla posts data disputing claim. — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 15, 2013  In any case, the Times has seized the moral high ground again by calling for Tesla to release the full unedited logs of the journey. The company thus far appears reticent to do so.  The Human Factor I remember reviewing a short-lived desktop computer from Apple in 2000, called the Cube. It was a gorgeous-looking machine, a brushed-metal brain in a clear perspex box. Just one problem: brushing my hand against the touch-sensitive power button on the top would switch it off. Was that my bad? Absolutely. Should the designer have accounted for such potential mistakes? You\\'re darn right. In my review, I wrote that the Cube \"seems to be asking for a perfect human to operate it.\" The more this back-and-forth between the Times and Tesla focuses on the small stuff the writer did outside the scope of the review — he took a two-mile detour into Manhattan, he drove above the speed limit once, he didn\\'t charge for a full hour, he didn\\'t turn down the in-car temperature to save the battery — the more sympathetic the reviewer becomes. Who here hasn\\'t ever broken the speed limit or taken a detour?  If the Model S only works if you drive below the speed limit between charging stations, if you have to charge it all the way every time, if you need to follow the advice of Tesla PR reps to the letter at every juncture — whether or not the writer did — then it is a car that is asking for a perfect human to operate it. Electric Dreams I write all of this with a heavy heart. I\\'m no Jeremy Clarkson. I really want Tesla to succeed, and if I could replace every gas-guzzling sedan on the planet with a Model S tomorrow, I would. Electric cars have far faster acceleration, far quieter engines, and they\\'re about a million times better for the planet (even though their electricity is largely generated by coal-fired power stations).  That\\'s exactly why Tesla has to put the Times story behind it as fast as possible. I implore Musk: release the full logs and be done. Focus instead on putting more reviewers behind the wheel of a Model S. Don\\'t leave it to one or two lucky journalists; flood the market with reviews. Accept that one or two might have bad experiences; that\\'s okay. Let them. What matters is making it appear that the Model S is everywhere, on every road, in every publication; not unimpeachable, just impossible to ignore. In the age of the electron, what really matters — what wins every time — is opinion in aggregate.

       " ' Frequent travelers who constantly fly across multiple time zones know how hard it is to even maintain a semblance of a \"normal\" sleep schedule. A new device from an Australian-based sleep research company might help out, and all you have to do is wear it like a pair of glasses. The Re-Timer wearable light device can help you catch some z\\'s by working to regulate your body\\'s internal clock. The device emits a soft green light, which is supposed to mimic natural sunlight. “Photoreceptors in our eyes detect sunlight, signal our brain to be awake, and set our rhythms accordingly,” Leon Lack, chief inventor and psychology professor at Flinders University in South Australia, said in a news release.  SEE ALSO: Website Offers Customized Jet Lag Reduction Plans So if you need to fall asleep earlier one night, you would need to wear the Re-Timer for 50 minutes after waking up that day. Conversely, if you need to stay up later and delay your body\\'s clock, you\\'d wear the device for 50 minutes before going to bed. The company recommends user wear Re-Timer three times a week, for the body to re-adjust. “These rhythms vary regularly over a 24-hour cycle, however, this process is often impaired by staying indoors, traveling to other time zones, working irregular hours, or a lack of sunlight during the winter months,\" Lack said. Re-Timer can be worn with reading glasses, and its battery is rechargeable via USB. The gadget is available in the U.S. and Australia for $273.90. Share your own tips for battling jet lag in the comments below. Thumbnail and images courtesy of Re-Timer BONUS: 10 Soothing Videos to Help You Sleep   10 Videos That\\'ll Put You to Sleep -- Literally        1. Forest and Nature Sounds  The sounds of nature have long been used to help people sleep. There\\'s something about the natural world that\\'s so soothing -- perhaps it\\'s the rarity of getting away from civilization. This video plays for 10 hours, ensuring that nothing will interrupt your deep sleep.           2. Relaxing Ambient Music and Calming Nature Sounds Why settle for the forest? This video has three hours of several nature sounds, featuring the ever-relaxing ocean, with ambient music to help you sleep.          3. Soft Whispering and Soothing Music  In all honesty, this video will probably creep you out at first. The narrator\\'s soft whispers are a little unsettling, but once you get used to it, you\\'ll find yourself weirdly relaxed. It has 50,000 views, and most of the commenters agree that it helped them drift off. Positive comments on YouTube? It must be true.           4. Night Crickets Remember those summer nights of your childhood, falling asleep to the sound of crickets outside your window? In this video, crickets chirp as you fall asleep to your own nostalgia.          5. Guided Meditation YouTube user Jody Whiteley has several videos in which she guides you toward meditation, relaxation or a deep sleep. It\\'s reminiscent of instructional yoga videos.           6. Thunderstorms Ever notice how tired you get on cloudy days? Recreate that experience with the sound of falling raindrops and soft thunder.          7. Music to Induce Delta Waves Delta waves are deep, slow brain waves emitted during deep sleep. This video claims to increase these waves to help you relax. Whether or not that\\'s true, the ambient music is soothing.          8. Tips for Falling Asleep Quickly This video won\\'t make you fall asleep by itself, but the various tips -- keeping your room clean and dark, turning off electronic devices, etc. -- can help revamp your sleeping ritual.          9. Samuel L. Jackson Reading \\'Go the Fuck to Sleep\\' [NSFW]  What happens when you combine a cheeky children\\'s book and Samuel L. Jackson\\'s baritone voice? Extreme relaxation, that\\'s what. There\\'s NSFW language in this video, but if you\\'re playing a video out loud at work, you have other problems.           10. Celestial White Noise White noise is a very neutral sound to maintain focus and block out distractions, but it can be very annoying. This video features \"celestial white noise\" -- it\\'s a little bit deeper, lower and less staticky.          BONUS: Goodnight, Mr. Bean If there\\'s one person with whom you can commiserate, it\\'s Mr. Bean. The British character, played by Rowan Atkinson, tries several ways to fall asleep in this video,  but it\\'s watching two men playing chess that really does the trick.       ',\n",
       " \" Apple's stock collapsed below $400 during midday trading Wednesday, a decline of more than 6% on the day and the first time that the stock has fallen below that milestone since December 2011. The stock was hit by multiple pieces of bad news on Wednesday. Cirrus Logic, one of Apple's suppliers for the iPhone and iPad, reported a lower-than-expected revenue forecast, which investors took to be a sign of weaker demand for Apple's products. Peter Misek, an analyst with Jefferies, reported hearing that Apple is having production issues that could delay its next iPhone models and Digitimes, a publication with a mixed track record on rumors, reported hearing from supply chain sources that iPad Mini shipments are expected to decline by as much as 30% in the second quarter of this year.  Last week, Hon Hai Precision Technology — the manufacturer better known as Foxconn — reported that its first-quarter sales had declined 19% year-over-year, which one analysts pinned on disappointing iPhone sales.   Apple is set to report its earnings for the March quarter next week and investors seem to be preparing for the possibility of disappointing iPhone sales and profits.  AAPL data by YCharts Apple's stock has suffered a steep drop in the past six months. It hit an intraday trading high of $705 in late September after the release of the iPhone 5, but then started to decline on concerns about supply constraints, executive shakeups at the company, increasing competition from Samsung and Google and a growing skepticism that Apple has another breakthrough product up its sleeve.  Apple's market cap has now dropped to around $380 billion, falling just below that of Exxon Mobil, which is now the most valuable corporation in the world. The stock went as low as $398 a share, but as of publication it was hovering right below the $400 mark. Image courtesy of Getty, Justin Sullivan \",\n",
       " ' Google is adopting a number of tech hubs across North America, and the locations may surprise you.  As part of the company\\'s two-year-old Google for Entrepreneurs effort to empower startups and their founders worldwide, Google announced a new Tech Hub Network on Wednesday in an effort to connect entrepreneurs across the continent. See also: 20 Searches Made Ridiculous by Google Autocomplete A tech hub is a physical space where entrepreneurs gather to build their companies, explained John Lyman, head of partnerships for Google for Entrepreneurs. The new network will include seven initial partners, none of which operate in traditional tech hotspots like San Francisco, New York or Austin, Texas. Instead, the founding members of Google\\'s new Tech Hub Network include 1871 (Chicago, Ill.), American Underground (Durham, N.C.), Coco (Minneapolis, Minn.), Communitech (Waterloo, Ontario), Galvanize (Denver, Colo.), Grand Circus (Detroit, Mich.) and Nashville Entrepreneur Center (Nashville, Tenn.). \"We think entrepreneurship has really changed in the last four or five years,\" Lyman said. \"People are coming together now more collectively as they start companies. Instead of going off in a garage and starting a company with a few people, you go to a co-working space or a tech hub or an accelerator where you\\'re with a larger community. We really want to help support that.\" As part of the network, the tech hubs will receive a number of Google benefits, including funding, discounts on products and software, and access to Google mentors. The different hubs will come together once each quarter in a mass conference call, and there will also be one in-person function per year, Lyman said. Google isn\\'t sharing any financial details, but Lyman said the money given to the hubs is not an investment — it\\'s sponsorship money. This means Google won\\'t automatically become an equity holder in any of the hubs\\' startups.  But there\\'s still something in it for Google. The tech giant will further develop relationships with startups all across the country and its Android products will be readily available for startups\\' use. (Imagine deciding between building your app for iOS or Android when you have Google Android engineers nearby for guidance.)    Google has helped support more then 30 different tech hubs in the past, most of which are located internationally. Google for Entrepreneurs sponsors a number of different programs focused on supporting startups and innovation around the world, including programs in North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

       " ' Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy face plenty of challenges in carrying out their typical duties. Moniz, who has the most unusual hairstyle of any sitting cabinet member, is in charge of revamping the country\\'s sprawling system of national laboratories, safeguarding America\\'s nuclear weapons stockpile and overseeing an expansion in next generation clean energy technologies. McCarthy is one of the Republicans\\' favorite targets on Capitol Hill since she is in charge of implementing new greenhouse gas emissions cuts nationwide.  However, tonight these two cabinet secretaries may face one of their most challenging task of all — throwing out the first pitch at the Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park.

The Energy Department released a video of Moniz practicing his pitching technique in Washington, D.C. last week, and according to the department\\'s YouTube channel, Moniz has some baseball experience.  Secretary Moniz isn\\'t new to baseball. A Boston native and longtime Red Sox fan, he played center field in his younger years — and was once invited to try out for the Detroit Tigers.

       " '  While Google Glass is a technological marvel, it isn\\'t exactly the most stylish of gadgets. Its awkward frame and chunky camera make the wearer look like they belong in a science-fiction film. So, in an effort to make Glass more stylish, software-development firm Sourcebits reimagined the device\\'s look.  See also: Top 28 Google Street View Sightings The revamped glasses, shown in the above video, have a retro appearance, complete with thick, black frames. A team of designers, illustrators and 3D-modelers envisioned frames that embrace all of Glass\\' technology, while redistributing the hardware more evenly. \"Google Glass right now has an uneven weight distribution because all the tech is packed on one side,\" said Benjamin George, the project\\'s creative director. George and his team addressed the issue by taking advantage of the arm of the glasses (which curve around the ears).  Touch sensors have been added to both sides of the frames, so that right-handed and left-handed users can easily access the technology. In February, Mashable reported that Google was in talks with eyewear designer Warby Parker to develop more stylish frames for Glass, although no concept has emerged since then.

       " \" Microsoft just appointed the third CEO in its 39-year history. Satya Nadella, who has been with the company for 22 years and currently manages the company's extensive cloud services, is now the man in charge of everything. He's also the wrong man for the job. First, disclosure: I don't know Nadella. My only contact with him has been at Microsoft's Build developer conference, and as a spectator. Nadella typically leads the Day 2 keynote — the one about servers, the cloud, SkyDrive, Office 365, Bing, Windows Azure and other insomnia-curing subjects. He always comes off as incredibly intelligent and to his credit makes the material about as interesting as it can possibly be.  See also: How to Install Windows 8 Without Ditching Windows 7 I think that he's able to do that from a real passion for what he's talking about. Nadella has degrees in electrical engineering and computer science and came to Microsoft by way of Sun Microsystems, where he was a member of the technology staff. Throughout his tenure at Microsoft, he's been knee-deep in the company's back-end services, from the cloud to servers to software clients. But passion for the back end doesn't mean Nadella has what it takes to lead Microsoft into its next era. The Return to Microsoft's Core For all the conversation around Windows 8 and Windows Phone, the stuff Nadella has been running is Microsoft's bread and butter. Those products and services are the reason the company remains incredibly profitable even as the PC market continues to significantly decline. His experience with Microsoft's infrastructure and services was obviously the main reason the board settled on him. And they definitely settled. Given how long it took Microsoft's board to choose Nadella (Steve Ballmer announced he was stepping down last August), they were clearly looking at other, external candidates. The choice facing the board was an existential dilemma: With no clear internal front-runner, they could either appoint a loyal Microsoftie to the top job or pick someone from the outside to shake things up. With Nadella, the board opted for the safe choice. It's not surprising — and he may yet be successful — but it's dismaying. For the past few years, Microsoft has been taking risks with Windows and Windows Phone to better play in the consumer markets dominated by Apple and Google. Some of those risks may have been misguided and overreaching, but it was good that Microsoft took them. Now is not the time to stop taking risks. I'm sure Nadella doesn't plan on doing so, but the CEO sets the tone for the entire company. Despite its financial success, Microsoft's mind share among consumers has shrunk over the last decade. That's because the company wasn't able to predict and get ahead of big technology trends, such as the rise of smartphones. Ballmer even said one of his regrets as CEO was that he didn't focus on Microsoft's mobile products early enough. Does anyone really think Nadella would have? If Microsoft wants to hang onto any clout in the consumer market it needs to be placing big bets on what the post-mobile world will look like. Wearables, health and fitness services, in-car experiences and on-demand content are all poised to explode. Apart from a little activity around Xbox, Microsoft hasn't led in any of these consumer-focused areas, and it's hard to see Nadella changing that. And Microsoft honestly hasn't even led the way in cloud services, supposedly Nadella's strong suit. Amazon Web Services was around for years before Windows Azure was a real alternative. Microsoft likes to brag that SkyDrive (now OneDrive) was around well before Box, Dropbox and Google Drive, but it let the service languish, unserviced and unpromoted, for years — with completely inconsistent branding. And it took the company far too long to bring services like Office 365 to iOS and Android. Nadella talks a lot about software and the cloud driving the next wave of technology, and he's right... to a point. Cloud services enable great things, but they don't capture consumer imagination. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who bought an iPhone because of iCloud. People care about design, user experience and whether or not the apps they want are available — all areas Microsoft has struggled lately. Road to Irrelevance Microsoft has recently taken steps to correct past mistakes, and its cloud offerings are now arguably stronger than competitors (SkyDrive integration with Windows 8.1 works almost exactly the same as local storage). With such resources at Nadella's disposal, the board probably saw great potential for them to flourish, and produce even greater profits. That's the dream scenario, at least. In reality, such a safe choice will probably put Microsoft on the same misguided course pursued by the likes of Sun, HP and even BlackBerry. There's no question there's money to be made by providing back-end enterprise-friendly services, but without focus on consumer, it's one wrong turn away from irrelevance. There's one asterisk beside Nadella's appointment, though, and that's the news that former CEO Bill Gates will return to an active, advisory role within Microsoft. Although Gates' first priority will always be his philanthropic endeavors, his genius and record are unquestionable. As long as Gates' new role isn't just PR spin, it's a great move for the company. Nadella's going to need him. What Microsoft needs now is someone who has a clear picture of where technology is headed, how to position the company to get there before competitors, and the willingness to take big risks to make that happen. That requires imagination and a good sense of how today's consumers interact with technology — two things Nadella has yet to show he possesses.  \",\n",

       " ' Russian President Vladimir Putin is tightening his grip on the Internet one new restriction at a time. The latest regulation is a law he signed on Monday that will require popular online bloggers to register with the government by Aug. 1. It also classifies all websites with more than 3,000 daily visitors as full-fledged media outlets, requiring them to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information they put online. See also: Russia Bans Cursing in Movies, Books and Music Once the law goes into effect, no one will be allowed to blog anonymously, and social networks and search engines will be required to keep records of all information posted on their sites dating back six months. The records must be kept within Russia\\'s borders. Punishment for breaking the law can result in a shutdown of the offending website and/or a fine of up to $142,000. Critics of the law told Reuters and the\\xa0New York Times that it was designed to stamp out political voices opposed to Putin and would give the Russian government the ability to easily decipher who was driving online conversation. Such criticism is nothing new — Russia has already tried to enact controversial controls over its Internet audience, which is the fastest-growing in Europe, according to Reuters. The Kremlin recently blocked access to the websites of Russian dissidents\\xa0Garry Kasparov and\\xa0Alexei Navalny because it claimed both sites asked Russian citizens to break the law. Kasparov is a former chess world champion who has since become an an advocate for democracy in Russia and even ran for president in 2007. Navalny has previously led demonstrations against Putin and has continued to oppose the government through his blog.  In March, the editor of the news site Lenta.ru was fired after a government agency conducted a review of the site\\'s articles and said it published extremist content. And on Monday, the same day Putin signed the new \"bloggers law,\"  he also signed another law that prohibits cursing in music, books, movies and more. Despite fear over the \"bloggers law,\" it\\'s unclear how effectively Moscow can enforce it. The law does not specify how the government will count site visitors. According to the\\xa0New York Times, blogging platforms\\xa0LiveJournal and Yandex have decided to halt their public traffic counters below the 3,000-visitor threshold, making it unclear how the government will prove those sites garner enough traffic to qualify as media outlets. The law also does not make clear whether platforms primarily run outside Russia such as Google or Facebook will also have to store data on Russian soil if they want to continue operating in the country. But the law\\'s vagueness is of little comfort to critics who see Putin building a censorship regime. ',\n",

       " \" Assassin’s Creed Unity was a game I really wanted to like. I’ve been a fan of the Assassin’s Creed series since its debut, and have always gotten a kick out of the games, despite some flaws. After last year’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag really raised the bar for the series in both scope and storytelling, I couldn't help but get excited at the prospect of another grand fight with the Templars.  However, Unity has jaded me not only to the Assassin’s Creed brand, but to Ubisoft as a whole. I can’t imagine how it will return to form after this. We’ll always have Paris Paris is the scene of most of the events of Unity, and it it’s absolutely breathtaking. Although not as varied in terrain or architecture as some of the previous locales of the series, Paris is certainly the prettiest. Textures are absolutely rich with detail, and if nothing else Ubisoft has created what may be the most graphically impressive game on next-gen consoles at this point. But graphical glitches abound, such as pop-in and characters’ facial textures disappearing at random, which detract from — and add an unexpected horror element to — the otherwise beautiful scenery and character modeling. See also: 'Dragon Age: Inquisition' is the sequel fans deserve The characters inhabiting Paris leave a bit to be desired, as I never really warmed up to the main character Arno Dorian. He’s extremely bland. He lacks the brooding and moroseness of Connor was in Assassin’s Creed III, or flair and personality of previous assassins Ezio and Kenway, or even the attitude of the original game’s Altair. There was never any opportunity to feel close to any of the characters in the game. None of the secondary characters were interesting or quirky as Black Flag’s Blackbeard and Mary Read.  Image: UbisoftA chore rather than a pleasure The game has a fantastic opening, where you’re cast as a 14th-century Templar defending his home fortress against an invading band of dastardly Assassins. The prologue is quite enticing, as it really showcases the alterations to the combat system, which feels much meatier. With each sword slash the small delay of action made each battle feel like a real swordfight, especially compared to the previous Assassin’s Creed games’ constant waiting to parry and riposte. In Unity, going on the offensive is a viable option and it feels great, unlike in previous iterations where attacking multiple enemies felt a bit like dancing on oil. Unfortunately, this new combat system is offset by a massive drop in frame rate, which takes all the fluidity and grace that the fighting may have had and transforms it into a slow-motion mess. In fact, throughout the game I experienced massive slowdown, be it running from guards through crowds or jumping from building to building. Really, almost any action could randomly cause the frame rate to plummet from the 30-fps range into the teens. This made the whole game feel like an absolute chore. Gone were the split-second decisions and tight controls of yesterday’s Assassin’s Creed titles, replaced with the chaos of speeding up and slowing down to the point where it was almost impossible to feel any kind of immersion or thrill from the game. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater Unity is supposed to be a return to form for the Assassin’s Creed series. Although some RPG leveling elements were left intact, for the most part this game returns to the style that defined the first two Assassin’s Creed games. Paris is your entire playground though; there’s no traipsing about the high seas for Arno. With the detailed exploration and crafting elements that were an integral part of the last two main series titles I couldn't help but feeling like this entry’s shallowness was a large step back. This in and of itself wouldn't be a dealbreaker if not for the rabid monetization features Ubisoft shoehorned into Unity. At quite a few points in the game I went to open a chest and was presented with a message either saying that I needed premium currency to “hack” the chest, or that I needed to join Ubisoft’s “Assassin Initiatives” program on my mobile phone to open it. This is a full-price title. Ubisoft’s expectation of anyone paying money on top of a $60 game (plus the $30 season pass) is absolutely insulting. More startling was the in-game currency could be purchased in increments up to $99.99. In addition, Ubisoft also offered packs for sale (for real money) that will instantly unlock basically an entire game’s worth of content.   Image: UbisoftWhere do we go from here? With the abundance of glitches and the lackluster gameplay, it’s obvious that Assassin’s Creed Unity was a glaring oversight on Ubisoft’s part, making it difficult to want to purchase an Assassin’s Creed title on the day of its release ever again. Although I was graciously provided a copy for this review, I cannot help but feel for those who in good faith went and bought a copy based on the series history. Black Flag did a lot to propel the series forward and ease the disappointment some felt with Assassin’s Creed III’s  erratic quality, but Unity has taken all the good faith generated by the previous title in the series and destroyed it. Ubisoft announced that a just-released patch should alleviate some of the abundant issues in the game. However, the very fundamentals of the title are flawed, and the microtransactions are abhorrent. I hope that Ubisoft takes heed to public outcry and returns the next entry in the series to the precedent set by Black Flag.  Assassin's Creed Unity   The Good Very pretty when not moving • Improvements to combat were welcome The Bad Major step back in features and gameplay for the series • Uninspired characters • An insulting amount of microtransactions • Gigantic, game-breaking glitches The Bottom Line Assassin’s Creed Unity is neither the Assassin’s Creed fans wanted or deserved. Time to go back to the drawing board, Ubisoft.    Assassin's Creed Unity was reviewed based on a copy provided by Ubisoft. The game is out for Xbox One, PC and PlayStation 4 for $59.99. \",\n",

       " ' It looks like Microsoft had a decent end to 2012. Microsoft reported earnings-per-share of $0.76 on revenue of $21.46 billion in the December quarter, beating EPS estimates by a penny but coming in just shy of Wall Street\\'s consensus estimate for revenue of $21.6 billion. Nonetheless, Microsoft\\'s revenue for the quarter set a new high. The Windows division of the company had a particularly strong quarter, generating $5.88 billion in revenue, a 24% increase from the same period a year before. Even when you factor in deferred revenue from Windows upgrade offers, Windows revenue was still up 11% year-over-year.  \"Our big, bold ambition to reimagine Windows as well as launch Surface and Windows Phone 8 has sparked growing enthusiasm with our customers and unprecedented opportunity and creativity with our partners and developers,\" Microsoft\\'s CEO Steve Ballmer said in a statement. \"With new Windows devices, including Surface Pro, and the new Office on the horizon, we’ll continue to drive excitement for the Windows ecosystem and deliver our software through devices and services people love and businesses need.\" Microsoft did not break out sales figures for its new Windows 8 products, other than to restate that it has sold more than 60 million Windows 8 licenses to date.  Microsoft\\'s stock was up down by about 1% in after hours trading following the earnings report. Image courtesy of Microsoft ',\n",
       " ' Have you ever wondered how much personal information Google or Facebook has about you? If you have, you certainly wouldn\\'t be the first one. In Europe, a student named Max Schrems requested that Facebook disclose all the information the social network had on him and he received a stack of 1,222 pages.  In the United States there is no legal requirement for companies to disclose such information to their customers. But that could be the case for just a matter of time, as a lawmaker in California is introducing a bill in the state Assembly to update the state\\'s data collection and privacy laws. The \"Right to Know Act of 2013\" would be the first law of its kind in the United States. It was introduced at the end of February by Democratic assembly member Bonnie Lowenthal, and it was amended on Monday in the California Assembly.  As it currently stands, the bill would basically compel companies to disclose, upon request, what data about a customer they hold and with whom they have shared it in the past year. The law defines \"customer\" as \"an individual who is a resident of California.\" Companies would have to send, free of charge, a copy of all that data to the customer, and they would have 30 days to comply with the request. For Lowenthal, these changes are necessary to keep the law up to date with changing times.  \"Today, our personal data is everywhere — we share it when using mobile phone apps, search engines and websites like Facebook and Twitter. Companies buy and sell it for profit,\" Lowenthal said in a press release. \"As technology advances, so should our consumer protections.\" Currently, under the law of the Golden State, a customer can request that a company disclose what data it holds on him or her — but only data used for direct marketing purposes. For example, the customer\\'s postal address or phone number which are used to send pamphlets or make telemarketing calls are subject to the disclosure requirement.  SEE ALSO Google Facing Fresh Privacy Investigations in 6 European Countries  Online rights advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation lobbied for and applauded the initiative. \"The new proposal brings California\\'s outdated transparency law into the digital age, making it possible for California consumers to request an accounting of all the ways their personal information is being trafficked —including with online advertisers, data brokers, and third-party apps,\" wrote Rainey Reitman, the EFF\\'s activism director, on a blog post.  Noting that this type of legislation already exists in Europe, the EFF argued that the law should not represent an excessive burden for big tech companies, which \"should already have systems in place to facilitate user access.\" For the group, the law is not about putting new restrictions on data sharing or data collection. Rather, the aim is to aid \"consumers, regulators, policymakers, and the world at large shine a light onto the largely hidden, highly lucrative world of the personal data economy,\" Reitman wrote. Though it would only be a state law, if passed, the legislation could have a serious ripple effect. After California passed a data breach notification law in 2002, 46 states followed suit.  When contacted, Facebook declined to comment on the legislation. Mashable also reached out to Google, but we\\'re still waiting on a response. Image via iStockphoto, Nikada ',\n",

However, since it was listed on our website it did represent an official policy.\" Read the full letter:  Post by Union Street Guest House.

UPDATE: 12:30 p.m. ET:  The Union Street Guest House posted to its Facebook wall on Monday, saying that the $500 fine for negative reviews was a joke.  The Union Street Guest House posted this message on its Facebook wall after criticism of a policy for charging for negative online reviews.Image:  FacebookSeveral commenters pointed to a Yelp review left in November 2013 from a guest who said the hotel emailed him trying to collect. The Yelp reviewer wrote:  The management of this hotel had the gall to email us twice to threaten us financially about the negative review! Here is an excerpt from their first email: \"please note that your recent on-line review of our Inn will cost the wedding party that left us a deposit $500.  This money be charged via  the deposit they have left us unless/until it is removed.  Any other or future reviews will also be charged to the wedding party (bride & groom) from the guarantee they have provided us. \" Disgusting! Instead of taking responsibility and striving to improve their customer service, they instead resort to intimidation!  Mashable will update this post with comment from the hotel if they respond to the request for comment. Our original story appears below.  A hotel in Hudson, New York, is going to new lengths to avoid bad online reviews: It\\'s fining guests who leave them. The Union Street Guest House, which hosts weddings and events, has a clause in its reservation policy stating that $500 of a couple\\'s deposit would be held for every bad review from their event\\'s attendees. See also: 10 Best Hotels in the U.S. for Foodies Online review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor are important to service providers, as more and more potential guests check reviews before booking a location. The clause in the Union Street Guest House policy reads: If you have booked the Inn for a wedding or other type of event anywhere in the region and given us a deposit of any kind for guests to stay at USGH there will be a $500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of USGH placed on any internet site by anyone in your party and/or attending your wedding or event. But if the review is taken down, all is forgiven.  The hotel\\'s website also states that the charge also applies to any guests: \"If you stay here to attend a wedding anywhere in the area and leave us a negative review on any internet site you agree to a $500. fine for each negative review.\" However, there is no clear way for the hotel to enforce this. \"Please note we will not charge this fee and/or will refund this fee once the review is taken down,\" the policy continues. The strategy isn\\'t helping the hotel\\'s Yelp score, which is currently at 1.5 stars, in part because of one-star reviews in response to the policy. The hotel says that its vintage look and \"hip\" decor are sometimes unpopular with guests. \"If your guests are looking for a Marriott type hotel, they may not like it here,\" the hotel\\'s website reads.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#appId=116628718381794&xfbml=1&status=1&cookie=1\",\"facebook_jssdk\"); ',\n",

SEE ALSO: 5 Tech Trends That Will Change Gaming Forever  \"As a result of feedback from the Xbox community, we have changed certain policies for Xbox One,\" Don Mattrick, President of the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft wrote on wrote on its blog:  So, today I am announcing the following changes to Xbox One and how you can play, share, lend, and resell your games exactly as you do today on Xbox 360. Here is what that means: An internet connection will not be required to play offline Xbox One games – After a one-time system set-up with a new Xbox One, you can play any disc based game without ever connecting online again. There is no 24 hour connection requirement and you can take your Xbox One anywhere you want and play your games, just like on Xbox 360. Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today – There will be no limitations to using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on Xbox 360. In addition to buying a disc from a retailer, you can also download games from Xbox Live on day of release. If you choose to download your games, you will be able to play them offline, just like you do today. Xbox One games will be playable on any Xbox One console — without any regional restrictions.  These changes will impact some of the scenarios we previously announced for Xbox One. Sharing games will work as it does today; you will simply share the disc. Downloaded titles cannot be shared or resold. Playing disc-based games will require the disc to be in the tray.  We appreciate your passion, support and willingness to challenge the assumptions of digital licensing and connectivity. While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content. We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds. Thank you again for your candid feedback. Our team remains committed to listening, taking feedback and delivering a great product for you later this year.  This is a huge change from Microsoft\\'s previously stated policy on games, in which it said a player could only share a purchased Xbox One game disc with one friend, and only if they had been on each other\\'s friends lists for more than 30 days. Microsoft also originally stated the Xbox One would need to connect to the internet every 24 hours to authenticate service and game data.  The news was broken by gaming site GiantBomb, causing Microsoft to release an official statement. The swift about face in policy was probably brought on by the reaction after last week\\'s E3 during which Sony attacked Microsoft\\'s DRM policies for the Xbox One. The audience at Sony\\'s E3 presentation erupted in cheers after hearing the PlayStation 4 would allow used games and not require a daily authentication check to Microsoft\\'s servers to function. Even talk show host Jimmy Fallon got into the debate during his \"Video Games Week\", where he has highlighted what\\'s new in gaming on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. \"The big story that everyone\\'s talking about is that this system is the only one where you can still play used games,\" Fallon said, pointing to the PlayStation 4.

       " ' A blistering heat wave has set in across the drought-scorched Plains, with all-time record high temperatures set in Kansas and Oklahoma during the past few days. The hot, dry weather there has sparked deadly wildfires, and it contrasts sharply with the deluge that recently struck the Gulf Coast, as well as the cooler-than-average spring in the Midwest and Northeast, where 19% of the Great Lakes are still covered in ice.  In Wichita, Kansas, the temperature hit 102 degrees Fahrenheit on May 4, which broke the record for the earliest 100 degree or higher temperature on record there, beating the old record of May 9. Records in Wichita date back to 1888. Wichita has had its driest start to the year since the Dust Bowl in 1936, with just 2.01 inches of rain falling between January 1 and April 30. See also: Tornadoes, Dust Storms and Floods: What the Hell Happened This Week? Drought conditions are contributing to the early heat wave, since more of the sun\\'s energy can go toward heating the ground and air when soils are dry compared to when they are wet, which diverts some incoming solar energy to evaporation.  According to the National Weather Service, if Wichita receives less than 0.36 inches of rain through May 8, it will officially be the driest start to a calendar year since records began, beating the Dust Bowl era when towering clouds of dust swept across the Plains, as a result of poor land management practices and a punishing multiyear drought. Here\\'s how Oklahoma state climatologist Gary McManus described the conditions in Oklahoma in an online note on May 5, which was first reported by the Capital Weather Gang blog: \"Oklahoma is burning, both literally and figuratively, as a combination of  drought, record heat, high winds and low relative humidity created the perfect wildfire conditions yesterday.\"   Departure from average of vegetation \"greenness\" for this time of year. The orange and yellow colors show areas where vegetation is drier, and less green, than average.Image:  Oklahoma State Climatologist OfficeOne wildfire in Guthrie killed one person who refused to evacuate,  and destroyed numerous properties. Other fires were visible from weather satellites orbiting the Earth. The National Weather Service in Wichita warned that ideal conditions for rapidly spreading grassland fires would continue through midweek, as high heat, low humidity, and high winds combine with record high temperatures to create a tinderbox on the prairie.  Fire weather alerts were also posted across seven other states in addition to Oklahoma, as an unusually warm and dry air mass settles in across the Plains and Southwest ahead of an approaching storm system. \"Lots of records fell where the drought is at its worst across western and northern Oklahoma,\" McManus said.  \"Of course it doesn\\'t help that the intensifying drought has kept most of the vegetation in a winter-like state, or more apt to the warm season conditions, like August. \\'Maugust?\\' Could also have been termed \\'Muly,\\' I guess,\" he continued, indicating how unusual the weather is for May. \"With so much dormant and dead vegetation leftover from winter, it still seemed like late summer to me.\"  \\'Extremely Critical\\' fire danger in parts of OK/TX/KS tomorrow. 100+ heat, gusty winds. pic.twitter.com/75glVQnHiT — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) May 5, 2014  McManus did not have much encouraging news for Oklahomans who are anxiously eyeing the rain gauge as the dry summer season approaches.  \"Once again, we\\'re in a horse race to the summer season when Mother Nature gives us that lovely mid-to-upper level ridge of high pressure that shuts off our rain and brings us a classic Oklahoma mid-June through mid-September Easy Bake Oven period. From now until mid-June is normally our wettest time of the year,\" he said.  Post by US National Weather Service Wichita Kansas. As reiterated by a report being released by the Obama administration on Tuesday, climate studies show that heat waves have already increased in their intensity and duration in many parts of the world, and this trend is expected to continue due to the buildup in manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Global warming is also expected to accentuate the differences between those areas that have an excess of precipitation and areas affected by drought.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#appId=116628718381794&xfbml=1&status=1&cookie=1\",\"facebook_jssdk\");_msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Ariel’s not the only one with gadgets and gizmos aplenty. In 16 locations across the U.S., audiences can bring their own tablets to the movie theater during the month after Sept. 20 — and actually use those devices during the film.  Disney’s latest re-release of the 1989 classic The Little Mermaid came with a twist: The company encouraged children to bring and use their iPads during the screening, provided, of course, they played along on Disney’s free iPad app, Second Screen Live: The Little Mermaid App. Audience members can play games, compete with other participants in the theater and sing along with the music as the story unfolds.  See also: Disney Princesses After the Fairy Tales End IPad in hand, I caught a showing of Second Screen Live: The Little Mermaid to test the app, the experience and to consider what second screen moviegoing means for the future of the industry.  The app is well designed. Using your iPad\\'s microphone to sync, its interactive elements match up with the film even if you have to close the app for any reason (like a potty break). The games come fast and often, and usually associate with a specific character or event in the movie. For example, when Triton comes onscreen you\\'ll be playing Triton\\'s Trivia. Most importantly, the games are appropriate for a wide range of ages — and 20-something reporters.  Video: Youtube, DisneyMovies This isn’t Disney’s first foray into the world of second screen gaming. The App Store has hosted second screen games for Real Steel, TRON Legacy, The Lion King and more for several months, as companions to the Blu-Ray DVDs.  However, bringing your second screen to the movie theater makes this version different, and it may indicate a future trend.  Disney has long supported the movie-going experience. Its classic re-releases offer new audiences a chance to see their favorite princes and princesses on the big screen — and Disney can make several million bucks or so in the process. The push for second screen is simply the next step. But does The Little Mermaid need second screens to get a second wind? The brand remains popular even after 25 years; according to Google, it\\'s the third most frequently mentioned Disney movie on the web. Does adding distracting games and new character voiceovers help a new generation fall in love with the story?  Because the games are distracting. Some moviegoers meeting Ariel and friends for the first time will find it hard to focus on the movie, with a new game every minute or two. Many games require an individual\\'s full attention, for instance, when players quickly pop bubbles or tilt the iPad to catch Ariel\\'s treasures in a chest. In fact, the games were so distracting, on multiple occasions key information was lost to gameplay.  See an example of one of the games in the video below:  Video: Youtube, Dis411 Not to mention the voiceover and inter-theater competition, where up to four characters talk over the dialogue in the film to encourage players to compete with other audience members. As someone who grew up with Ariel, sure, the games were fun. But children seeing the movie for the first time missed seeing Triton destroy Ariel\\'s treasures; Ariel meet Eric for the first time; Ariel\\'s visit with Scuttle.  The only time the iPad truly helps the audience pay attention to the movie is during a song. Following along with lyrics on your iPad not only provides good practice for young readers, it helps the audience focus on the movie\\'s plot.  Is this the future of the movie theater? While The Little Mermaid will soon return to the Disney Vault, iPads and all, Disney is releasing The Nightmare Before Christmas: Second Screen in theaters later this year. One can expect the trend will continue as long as the movies are profitable.  So, does this mark the beginning of a trend for moviegoers? And if so, could it revive the movie theater industry or drive the final nail in the coffin?  The Pros  Despite the number of \"digital detox\" vacation tips you may have read this year, we\\'re more attached to our devices than ever. Statista reports that the amount of time Americans spend consuming digital media will eclipse the amount of time spent watching television for the first time ever this year. The extension of the second screen experience into the movie theater seems like a natural progression. Adding a game element to a movie elevates it from a linear to non-linear narrative, giving audience members the chance to interact with the story and its characters. It revitalizes the almost 25-year-old animation, bringing it up to par with more recent animated creations like Monsters University or Brave. And the novelty of the experience could drive revenue for Disney in a time when many agree the the movie industry is in decline. There\\'s no telling what\\'s next for second screens. If geared towards an adult audience, second screens could provide background information, a chance to live-tweet movie reviews to friends or quiz movie buffs. For series, (like the upcoming Star Wars episode, perhaps?) audiences could get refreshers on how characters fit into the universe, family trees, etc.  The Cons  There\\'s a reason we\\'re instructed to turn off cellphones before a movie. Extra devices ruin the movie experience by providing unwanted distractions that take the viewer out of the story. Ariel walking on her shaky legs for the first time is excitement enough for young audiences. Many parents are trying to limit their children\\'s screen time, especially for children under the age of five, due to its potential link to emotional distress, anxiety and depression. As of now, you need an iPad to participate. Not an iPhone. Not an Android or Microsoft tablet. So, what about the other 50% of the tablet-wielding population?   Where do you stand on Disney\\'s second screen / silver screen experience? Let us know in the comments.  Image: Youtube, DisneyMovies ',\n",
       " ' It\\'s a Monday in March, and that means Twitter users are likely \"hungover\" and \"late to work.\" At least that\\'s what the data tells us.  Twitter compiled data published Monday that looks at when users tweet certain words and phrases like \"feel happy,\" \"feel sad,\" \"hungover,\" and \"late to work.\" The data, which is broken down by month and day of the week, looked at tweets in English from 2013 to get a feel for what users are feeling, and when.  See also: The Year in Twitter: Top Milestones of 2013 Some of the results were predictable. Users tweet \"late for work\" with more regularity during summer weekdays. Users tweet \"feeling sad\" in December more than any other month, possibly a cause of gloomy weather or being away from family for the holidays.  There are other factors that may impact tweets, of course. For example, Tuesdays in December are a common day for Twitter users to tweet that they are \"feeling happy.\" Not coincidentally, Christmas Eve and New Year\\'s Eve fell on a December Tuesday in 2013.

       " \"  In his latest video, Brooklyn-based artist j. viewz performs an electronic version of Massive Attack’s “Teardrop” using only vegetables. Well, not just vegetables, actually; with some grapes, kiwis, and strawberries thrown in, this band is 50% fruity. Regardless, his performance is captivating – certainly not your average vegetable medley. But how does it work? The key to the whole thing appears at 0:26, where Dagan shows Makey Makey, a circuit board created by MIT graduate students Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum that lets normal objects like mushrooms or eggplants take the place of keyboard keys. Dagan describes how it works in a brief interview below.  The Atlantic: Was any part of the video or sound pre-recorded, or was it actually generated live in the video?  Jonathan Dagan: All the sounds were generated live, but the actual samples that were triggered were pre-made. The processing of the sound on the Novation keyboard also happened live, of course. How does the circuit board work? The Make Makey circuit board translates signals from various media into my computer. I turned that signal into MIDI commands, making the veggies into a MIDI controller, same as the keyboard you see in the video. Both feed MIDI signals into the computer and trigger samples in [the music editing program] Ableton Live. It took me a while to understand that I needed to explain it in more detail on the video – the shape of the fruits and vegetables does not affect the sound it triggers. Technically I could have used exposed wires for all of the samples, or even a human body or a glass of water for that matter. It's simply nice to “embody” a bass drum sound with an eggplant, bells with grapes and the sweet melodic sound with strawberries. In your opinion, what's the most musical vegetable?  Well, I've been playing with MIDI controllers for a while and tested lots of drum pads, but I've never worked with a drum pad that was more comfortable and ergonomic than an eggplant, really.

       " ' The Weather Channel will return to DirecTV starting Wednesday after resolving its carriage dispute with the satellite television carrier. The deal will result in the weather-centric station cutting its reality programming during the week by half, the Weather Channel said in a press release. See also: How Tech Can Prepare You for Extreme Weather The channel had been demanding a $0.01 increase in its per-subscriber payment from DirecTV. It settled for less than that, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Weather Channel reportedly commands about $0.13 per subscriber, far less than $5.54 by ESPN or $0.60 by CNN, according to estimates from SNL Kagan. Jim Cantore, a meteorologist for the channel, issued a letter directed at DirecTV\\xa0and said the dispute put people in danger. \"I think it’s a dangerous gamble to put lives at risk for a penny,\" he wrote. The Weather Channel issued a public apology to DirecTV in a press release announcing the new deal. “Our apologies to DirecTV and their customers for the disruption of our service and for initiating a\\xa0public campaign,” said David Kenny, CEO of the Weather Company, parent to The Weather Channel, in the press release. “Our viewers deserve better than a public dispute and we pledge to reward their loyalty with exceptional programming and more weather focused news.” The dispute highlights the still lucrative place of television despite the rapid growth of online weather services and apps. The Weather Channel has experienced strong growth in its online traffic, attracting just more than 105 million unique visitors in February across its digital platforms, according to comScore. That traffic helped its digital division to account for almost half of the Weather Channel\\'s revenue.

       " \" Adobe Digital Index research indicates record playoff audiences and surging social media buzz, suggesting Super Bowl XLVIII viewership is poised to capture the title of the U.S.'s largest television audience broadcast of all time. What’s more, Fox Sports' announcement that it will live stream the game to iPads just about ensures that this year’s game at MetLife Stadium, in New Jersey, will also be the most mobile Super Bowl ever.  For marketers, however, this year's Super Bowl — which, for more than two decades, has been a showcase for the most innovative and expensive advertising of the year — has become a more complex challenge: While the worlds of digital and broadcast have merged into one from the viewer's perspective, they remain somewhat disconnected on the marketer's side. Social media marketing, online video releases and mobile optimized websites are now key to creating that trophy-winning Super Bowl marketing moment. That's why many marketers have assembled teams of digital specialists to augment their grand broadcast investments to score some big-game points. Social Media Is Off The Sidelines The opportunity to capitalize on social media marketing during the Super Bowl is massive. In fact, advertisers have already started to see large gains in their social mentions, and after a week of post play-off activity, Super Bowl advertisers have surpassed the social media mentions of their competitors.* This trend shows no signs of slowing down as we roll into the game.   Image:  AdobeThe main driver of increased social buzz appears to be television advertising. Chevrolet released an ad teaser on the 28th that helped put it to the number one spot in social media mentions.* Pepsi's big ad during the Grammy show pushed the brand above Coca-Cola for the first time in the last few weeks. Budweiser launched a series of pre-Bowl ads designed to initiate conversation on Twitter with #UpforWhatever, which saw some buzz but not enough to break into the top 5 advertisers.*  Image:  AdobeIn addition to the size of the campaign, quality creative that is humorous, altruistic or emotionally evocative factors into the results for marketers. Social Buzz Predicts Big Viewership Previous ADI reports have demonstrated that social media buzz is an accurate predictor of future viewership. This year, if the number of social media mentions of the Super Bowl, teams, coaches and key players in the week immediately following the final playoff games are any indication, viewership for this year's event should be sky-high, leading us to predict this year's Super Bowl will be the largest U.S. sporting event audience ever.  Image:  AdobeConversation about teams and quarterbacks is also growing and shows the building excitement about the game.   Image:  Adobe Image:  AdobeWeb and Mobile Traffic Playbook ADI analysis* of the past three Super Bowls demonstrates that Internet traffic starts picking up for Super Bowl advertisers prior to Sunday, with peaks increasing during the broadcast as a result of more mobile traffic. Traffic is typically up 15% during the day of the game; during the event, itself, traffic runs 20% above normal. Traffic remains higher than average for a few weeks after the game, as the lingering impact of the advertising continues.  ADI research also suggests that with more social pre-game activity, advertisers' websites will see an uptick in traffic earlier, and post-campaign activity could sustain that traffic surge longer.  Image:  AdobeMobile Is The Ticket Over 50% of viewers will have a smartphone in their hand at some point during the game. One in 3 of them will be using the phone to chat on social media.** So it's not surprising that ADI research also suggests that visits to advertiser's websites via mobile devices are expected to lead the increase in traffic on game day, and Super Bowl advertisers will see a jump in mobile traffic — 60% more than a typical day, with nearly one in three website visits coming from a mobile device during the big game.  2014's Biggest Opportunity This is the year the Super Bowl's tradition of marketing excellence will become truly digital, with the event likely generating the largest mobile and social marketing opportunities of 2014. Not only are savvy advertisers making sure their websites are optimized for mobile traffic, they are also pushing forward with incremental mobile and social supporting campaigns. Even those marketers that can't afford the $4 million TV ad price tag are poised to take advantage of the incremental mobile and social traffic to launch digital-only campaigns.  After the game, check back to find out how Super Bowl advertisers faired in social, mobile and web site traffic. *Research is based on the analysis of select, anonymous and aggregated data from over 5,000 companies worldwide that use the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, to obtain real-time data and analysis of activity on their websites.

       " \" Searchers scouring the waters of the Indian Ocean off Australia’s west coast have not yet succeeded in locating the missing Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200, but they have focused global attention on just how many pieces of manmade detritus is floating in our oceans. Search personnel have referred to the trash, which ranges in size as small as a plastic water bottle to as large as a 70-foot long shipping container, with different descriptors, from garbage to the more unfamiliar and nautical term “flotsam.” Although the search area is not located in the famous Great Pacific Ocean “garbage patch,” it is located at the edge of one of five “gyres” where ocean currents and the atmospheric circulation draws in waste like a magnet. See also: Investigators: We May Never Know What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 “At least this is letting the world know that garbage patches are not confined to the Pacific,” said Captain Charles Moore, whose work first drew the world’s attention to the Pacific garbage patch. “The ocean itself has become this plastic soup,” Moore told Mashable. “Families seeing this happen must feel terrible that they’re being told their deceased relatives and friends are in a garbage patch,” Moore said. Moore founded the Algalita Marine Research Institute that works to raise awareness and help reduce the amount of plastic pollution that goes into the world’s oceans, where it can remain for decades. Such trash harms wildlife, damages ships, and as seen in the current search for the missing plane, can frustrate urgent search and recovery operations. Studies have shown that about 90% of the trash in the ocean is plastic, Moore says, and that there are probably up to 10,000 lost shipping containers drifting along with ocean currents around the world. Pollution can magnify other challenges the oceans face. A new climate change report released this week predicts sweeping changes in marine life in the coming decades due to warming and acidifying seas, with pollution adding to the stress on marine species. According to Moore, shipping companies do not have to report lost containers when they go overboard, despite the fact that they constitute a hazard to other vessels, as was driven home in the recent Robert Redford film “All Is Lost”.  Map of the five subtropical gyres around the world.Image:  5gyres.orgAccording to Marcus Eriksen, the executive director and co-founder of the environmental advocacy group 5 Gyres, trash in such gyres usually drifts with the currents at about the same pace as a person walks. This means that if there is aircraft debris in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean Gyre, it is likely to be about 100 miles or more away from its original location. The gyres have relatively slow-moving currents because they are located in areas where high pressure systems tend to dominate the weather, leading to light winds and docile seas. This can prevent trash from escaping a gyre for months or more. For this reason, Moore likens the gyres to “a toilet that doesn’t flush.” Eriksen, who used to work with Moore but decided to set out on his own expanded effort to focus attention on all of the world’s garbage patches, rather than just the massive one in the Pacific, told Mashable that much of the waste in the five subtropical gyres consists of derelict fishing gear, in addition to plastic. “Because it’s designed to last forever it actually does,” Eriksen says. Despite what many people think, he says, plastic bags don’t usually make it to the middle of a gyre, since they tend to disintegrate into flecks that fish then consume. Eriksen says that during trips to all five gyres, he has come across many low quality durable goods, including umbrella handles, bottle caps, Starbucks straws and forks and knives. “It’s almost like a department store washed ashore when you come into these gyres,” Eriksen says. In 2013, Eriksen sailed into the Bay of Bengal from Sri Lanka, and found an unusually large amount of trash floating off the coast of Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries with lax environmental regulations. “It is unreal how much trash is floating in the Bay of Bengal,” he says. Trash from the Bay can cross the equator and enter the Indian Ocean gyre, which partly encompasses the Flight 370 search area. Trash there is most likely coming from a variety of distant places, Eriksen said, including the Bay of Bengal, South Asia, Africa and parts of the Southern Ocean north of Antarctica. In fact, Eriksen said his research indicates that all subtropical gyres are connected, with trash moving between them over time. “Those three gyres communicate,” he said. In June, Eriksen's group is planning to study plastic pollution in the North Atlantic and Viking Gyres, and is running a video contest to bring a member of the public along with them. What are the solutions? While the current trash problem exists at sea, and appears to be worsening as plastics production increases worldwide, particularly in nations that don’t have stringent environmental protections, advocates say most of the solutions would need to take place on terra firma — back on solid ground.  Typical mid-sized debris found in the garbage gyres.Image:  5gyres.orgBoth Eriksen and Moore said they are seeking to alter the very paradigm of capitalism regarding manufacturers' responsibility for the end disposal of their products. They say the plastics industry needs to take responsibility for their products from manufacturing to disposal. If you’re going to make products made of plastic, Eriksen says, “you’ve got to have a plan for its whole life.” As Moore put it in an interview, every item that is built needs to have a “reincarnation pathway” for being reused or broken down in such a way that it cannot wind up traveling the global seas, going from gyre to gyre like a baton stuck in an endless relay race. Such a plan could consist of providing incentives to consumers to return used plastic items for a financial gain, much as is currently done with aluminum soda cans. Similarly, Eriksen said fishermen could be given a monetary incentive to haul in and return used fishing gear that they find floating in the open ocean. Also, alternatives to plastic items could be used in many settings, such as by switching out plastic straws for paper ones at coffee shops like Starbucks, Eriksen says. \",\n",

The cabins date back to the late 1800s, according to the Marin Independent Journal, and will be used as a dining area for employees.  See also: You\\'ll Make Bank With These 10 Highest Paying Tech Internships The idea started with Lundberg Design, one of the firms that designed the space at Twitter\\'s headquarters when the company moved there in 2012, which was looking for ways to divide up Twitter\\'s dining space.  \"It\\'s a big dining area, but a relatively low ceiling height, so how do we divide up the space and make the scale feel better,\" Olle Lundberg, an architect with the firm, told Mashable. \"We came up with this idea of rooms within larger rooms.\" Or, more accurately, log cabins within larger rooms.  In fact, the idea for a log cabin started two years earlier when Lundberg was searching Craigslist for materials and stumbled across a listing from \"a guy in Sonoma\" who was looking to sell off some log cabins. \"I just sort of stuck the thing in a folder,\" Lundberg said. Four months ago, he reached out to the seller and was told that the log cabins were no longer available, but \"he knew of some others in Montana.\" While it might sound more than a little bit odd for a tech company in the middle of a city like San Francisco to embrace materials associated with the outdoors (and another era), Lundberg notes that this has long been a theme of the office. Twitter uses reclaimed woods in its office and, under Lundberg\\'s direction, has repurposed other random materials, including part of a bowling alley which was used to make the reception desk.  \"The forest has always been a nice image for them,\" Lundberg said. \"They like wood. They like rustic.\" He also notes that there is the \"corny tie to the bird,\" meaning Twitter\\'s logo. Twitter, for its part, emphasized that it likes to recycle materials whenever possible. \"We\\'re very excited about this project, not only because it\\'s beautiful, but also because it\\'s another great instance of how we continue to re-use materials as we build out our presence,\" Jim Prosser, a representative for Twitter, said in a statement. If nothing else, it will give new meaning to employees logging out.  ',\n",
       " ' China this week became the third nation to land a rover on the Moon, and experts believe the country will follow up with a manned mission to the lunar surface in just a matter of years. The country\\'s rapidly improving program and America\\'s perceived lack of direction could, years from now, lead to a new space race. The spacecraft Chang\\'e 3 and its rover, Yutu, are only on the lunar surface to explore. But China\\'s zeal for space is unmatched, and its program is developing fast — to the point that it can be recognized as a space power. Just what that means for the U.S. is up for debate. See also: China\\'s Moon Lander Takes a Space Selfie \"I\\'m not saying they\\'re militarizing space, or occupying it or [that] they\\'re going to claim the moon ... but there\\'s always that consideration in that relationship between countries,\" Paul Spudis, a scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, told Mashable. For Spudis, the issue is not China\\'s presence in the lunar region, but the United States\\' absence. He\\'s worried a country that doesn\\'t advocate for a free market could some day stifle how other nations and private businesses operate in space. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s anything to panic about,\" Spudis said. \"It\\'s something to think about seriously.\" John Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, told Mashable\\xa0that if China wants to play with the big powers on Earth, they had better play with them in space, too. That means, at some point, a manned trip to the moon. China has launched several military satellites, which have also caused consternation among some U.S. officials. But Logsdon thinks China\\'s program has caused undue alarm. What the Chinese have done is impressive, sure, but they\\'re a long way from their own mission to Mars. \"People have very short attention spans,\" Logsdon said. \"A year and a half ago we landed a remarkable rover on Mars, and it\\'s producing all kinds of discoveries.\" Pascal Lee, planetary scientist at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute, told Mashable he wouldn\\'t disagree that America\\'s program is superior. But he feels China\\'s recent success needs to renew American interest in the space program because Beijing\\'s progress has been steady for years, and their missions have so far been almost flawless. What\\'s more, China seems to have its eyes on tougher missions in the near future. Chang\\'e 3 is big enough to hold much more than the rover it deposited, meaning the Chinese could have fit a larger, more capable robot in there. With a few more upgrades, they might be able to squeeze in a person or two. \"The truth is these events are really remarkable and they need to get our attention,\" Lee said.\\xa0\"As soon as we see a Chinese astronaut walking on the moon, I think it\\'s going to become a national interest of the U.S. to get back to the moon.\" Image: Wikimedia Commons ',\n",
       " ' The Voice waited until the last five minutes of its two-hour finale to crown a winner, as reality singing competition to do, but don\\'t worry, we won\\'t make you wait.  Craig Wayne Boyd, the underdog country singer, won it all.  The odds were stacked up against Craig going into Tuesday night\\'s season ender. The three of the other finalists were on Team Adam. (Adam must be livid.) He was the only country singer, and he\\'s a lot older than the other artists. This win just goes to show how strong the country music fan base is.  Before we continue, a disclaimer: I was rooting for Chris Jamison, who will surely make a name for himself in the music industry. But, I\\'m happy for Craig, as he was one more of the more consistent singers this season. He will no doubt have a successful career.  In fact, if anything was made evident during the two-day finale, it\\'s that all the final artists have promising futures. Here are some stellar moments to replay:  Top 5 moments 1. The original songs (and music videos) The four finalists performed original songs written specifically for them, as a way to show viewers the kind of music they\\'d be recording post-Voice. All of the songs were perfectly suited to the singers\\' voices. If I had to choose, I\\'d say Damien\\'s was the weakest song.   Craig\\'s song, \"My Baby\\'s Got a Smile On Her Face,\" was given to him by Blake Shelton who had been \"carrying it around” for years, not knowing what to do with it.  I\\'m glad he offered the tune to Craig, because the country singer knocked it out of the park.  Matt\\'s single, \"Wasted Love,\" blew everyone away. His performance was emotionally charged and downright beautiful. The single hopped up to number 1 on iTunes quickly after the show (above Taylor Swift\\'s \"Blank Space,\" I might add).  Chris\\' song \"Velvet,\" was steamy, powerful and catchy. I could totally envision this single playing on the radio.  The four music videos are also worth watching. Both Chris and Damien\\'s take place in the rain, but Chris\\'s is a little more sultry. Matt\\'s and Craig\\'s videos visualize nice love stories, as music videos often do.   2. A trip down memory lane During Tuesday night\\'s show, each judge was honored in short montages that chronicled their journey this season.  The two best segments were those for Pharrell and Blake, which makes sense because these two were hilarious to watch.  A Star Wars-esque visual scrolled across the screen, telling the tale of the \"Voice Jedi\" who stole the season. And so it goes: \"His name was Pharrell? Bringing with him big hats and even bigger ideas. Words Adam and Blake could not understand. He spoke in riddles, as if on a mystical musical journey to not just find a voice, but to confuse his fellow coaches along the way ...\"  And then we watched a beautifully accurate montage of Pharrell holograms, spitting some of his best lines. Blake\\'s video, meanwhile, was nothing short of a masterpiece, courtesy of the geniuses at NBC, who cut together dozens of clips for a spliced-together version of MC Hammer\\'s \"Can\\'t Touch This.\" \"Stop — it\\'s Shelton time.\"  3. The Voice got funked up Another outstanding moment from Tuesday\\'s show was a performance of \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson and the one-and-only Bruno Mars, who even wore rollers in his hair like the ones he rocks in the \"Uptown Funk\" music video.  Yes, electro-motown danced straight onto the stage, but we kind of wish Chris had been able to perform up there with them seeing as how he performed the song a few weeks ago.   Watching Bruno hit that stage really displayed how far these singers have to go before they make it into superstardom. Yes, they\\'re all talented. But they certainly aren\\'t Bruno.  4. Superstar performances  The night was filled with big name performers. We saw solo performances from Bruno Mars, Meghan Trainor and Ed Sheeran. But more importantly, the final four sang duets with the likes of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jennifer Hudson, Fall Out Boy and Jessie J. All four were superb, but there were three clear standouts:  Craig Wayne Boyd and Lynyrd SkynyrdSong: \"Sweet Home AlabamaEveryone can and should appreciate the country music magic that was made on the stage here. This was a sweet moment to watch.   Damien and Jennifer HudsonSong: \"It\\'s Your World\"One thing\\'s sure: Jennifer Hudson looks incredible as always. This belting pair was also a perfect match-up and did so mighty well.   Chris Jamison and Jessie JSong: \"Masterpiece\"What else can we really say about Chris? He slays each and every performance, and Jessie J certainly noticed. She looked so proud of her co-performer, letting him take the spotlight throughout the song. They seemed to really hit it off, and they sounded incredible together. Perhaps we\\'ll see a future collaboration?  5. \"Ain\\'t No Mountain High Enough\" For Damien\\'s \"return\" performance, where he could bring back his favorite contestants, he picked three superstar soul singers: Anita Antoinette, Elyjuh Rene and DaNica Shirey.  Their rendition was everything you could possibly want from a Marvin Gaye & Tami Terrell cover — spunky, powerful and it put a smile on my face. While all the \"return\" performances were great, this one brightened the night.  Back to the beginning To cap off this recap, let\\'s take one last trip down memory lane and remember how this season began.  Singing Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart\\'s \"The Whiskey Ain\\'t Working,\" Craig Wayne Boyd impressed the coaches and America with his genuine country sound. He and Blake worked together to fine tune the performer\\'s star quality, and they succeed.  One last congratulations to this season\\'s winner — I\\'m sure to be hearing from him and many other of Season 7\\'s contestants soon.   And that our friends, is a wrap.  Are you happy with this season\\'s results? Who did you want to win? Tell us in the comments. ',\n",
       " ' With two things as rapidly changing as the Internet and a child\\'s development, sometimes safety settings aren\\'t enough. Besides built-in precautions like Google SafeSearch, what should parents teach their children about the Internet, and when\\'s the right time to start? See also: I Felt Like a Criminal: The Pressure to Become a Helicopter Parent According to Amy Morin, About.com\\'s child discipline expert and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\\'t Do, these lessons should start \"right from the get-go.\" \"The overall lesson is that the Internet can be a wonderful tool and doesn\\'t necessarily have to be dangerous, but that bad things can happen,\" Morin says. Chronological age and developmental age — a child\\'s psychological maturity — can differ from one another, so Morin emphasizes having continual conversations according to \"whatever conversation is developmentally appropriate.\"  As a grade-schooler, that means acknowledging the Internet has adult content and not to open up sites that Mom or Dad hasn\\'t opened already, while middle schoolers should know how to handle cyberbullying and pornography, as well as how much information about themselves should be kept off the Internet or hidden under privacy settings. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, 69% of parents in 2012 were concerned about how their child’s online activity might affect their future academic or employment opportunities. See list below for the eight Internet lessons you should cover with your kids. 1. \\'You don\\'t have to please everyone on the Internet.\\' The most important lesson, Morin says, is that kids \"don\\'t have to please everybody, that when they get approached by a predator or a friend is peer pressuring them into something, they should know they don’t have to do that.\" This advice is one way to set boundaries without policing too hard, by making sure your child is comfortable before telling him he can log off. You should also reiterate this lesson to your kids no matter how old they are, because it applies to children of all ages — both when they begin to encounter other Internet users and when they start messaging their friends on social networks. 2. \\'We\\'ll recover from mistakes together.\\'  Told my 7yo that there are things on the internet that aren\\'t appropriate for children. \"So, like, pictures of poop and stuff?\" she said. — Rachel Sanders (@_RachelSanders) November 15, 2014  “Kids work hard to cover their tracks,\" Morin says. Before they can start making mistakes — such as accidentally opening an inappropriate website or sending a picture they shouldn\\'t have — parents should make it clear that honesty is always preferable over hiding an accident. Morin suggests letting them know that “things can happen whether you mean to or not, and maybe it’s not even your fault.” The key is to plan ahead for these mistakes. 3. \\'Start simple.\\' As children watch their friends or older siblings join social networks, they\\'ll want to follow along. This moment is when you should make compromises for the simpler social sites, especially at a young age. Instead of allowing them to join Facebook and Twitter, where privacy settings can be complicated and private information is more readily available, Morin says that platforms like Pinterest, where they can share content about things they like in a private space, are a good gradual step to more complicated social sites. 4. \\'Rules still apply on the Internet.\\'  Best way for our children to learn about the Internet is to keep them off it? Please. Apply that to rest of world, it\\'s nonsense #blogfest — Jax Blunt (@liveotherwise) November 8, 2014  While Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest have age restrictions on users under 13 years old, many kids lie about their ages when signing up. (Twitter doesn\\'t have an age restriction, although it screens in order to restrict age-inappropriate advertising.) Kids should know that, just as it wouldn\\'t be OK to lie about their ages to get into R-rated movies, it isn\\'t OK to lie about their ages online, either.  While some kids below 13 may be mature enough to join these websites, Morin says, \"Plenty of them aren’t prepared to handle it. They’re impulsive, so they’re much more apt to saying inappropriate things.\" Parents should determine whether their child can handle peer pressure and refrain from saying rude or mean things. 5. \\'Stick to what\\'s comfortable.\\' On content sites such as YouTube, Morin recommends that parents set specific guidelines based on what their child enjoys. \"If you’ve got a child that likes One Direction, [tell her] you can look up One Direction videos,\" Morin says. However, parents should supervise nonetheless, because a video that looks age-appropriate at the outset could still have mature content.  6. \\'Don\\'t try to set privacy settings by yourself.\\'  Dear Jesus, help me to raise children who don\\'t comment on the internet. — Ana Gasteyer (@AnaGasteyer) October 28, 2014  Privacy settings are often too difficult for kids to understand, so parents should set a time to talk about privacy settings when their children start joining social media websites. Talk them through who can and can\\'t see what they post, and teach them that they should still be careful about sharing information. Their content could still be exposed to a lot of people, Morin explains, whether they change their settings accidentally or the site\\'s privacy policy changes in the future. 7. \\'Time online is a reward.\\' Many parents treat time on the Internet as a reward for their child, even when he or she gets older and has a laptop for the first time. Morin agrees with the use of this policy, because it prevents bad habits from forming in adulthood. \"Teach kids that it’s OK to have time without constant screens. It\\'s OK for them to be alone with their thoughts,\" she says. 8. \\'Certain activities will be supervised.\\' Personal information, such as the password for the family computer or credit card information, should be entered by a parent as the situation permits. Morin recommends letting your kids have online freedom gradually. For example, tell them they can only use the computer alone while in a common area. In terms of using retail websites like Amazon, \"insist on some type of rule that if they shop online, [you have to] approve of what they’re going to buy until they’re in high school, and they have their own money,\" Morin says.

       " ' Frightening others has always been a big part of trick-or-treating tradition. But when it comes to polar bears, the fear is a bit too real for the small Inuit hamlet of Arviat in Canada\\'s northernmost Nunavut territory. The hamlet decided it will be holding all Halloween festivities indoors this year due to an increase in polar bear sightings this fall. Residents have seen an upswing in the number of bears wandering into town in recent years as warmer winters have diverted the animal\\'s migration route to pass directly by the community of roughly 2,000 people.  See also: Google Street View Maps the \\'Polar Bear Capital of the World\\' The hamlet\\'s governance met with members of the public last week to discuss safer alternatives to outdoor trick-or-treating, in light of the threat posed by the arctic predators. The community decided that kids will instead be able to take a shuttle bus to the local community hall, where organized trick-or-treating will be set up inside. \"Picture 1,200 kids going door to door in Arviat in the middle of polar bear season,\" Steve England, Arviat\\'s senior administrative officer, told CBC. \"It\\'s a pretty obvious conclusion of what tragedies could come out of that. We\\'re just trying to safeguard the younger population by offering an alternative.\" According to Polar Bears International, a conservation group, a warming winter climate has caused the Hudson Bay to freeze later in the year, on average, and for an increasingly shorter period. The delay forces the bears heading north for the winter to follow the coastline instead of venturing east onto the ice, leading them right through Arviat.  ',\n",
       " ' Colony Collapse Disorder may sound like the name of a dystopian science fiction novel, but it\\'s a real and present danger to the planet. For years, honey bees around the globe have been wandering from their hives and dying for no apparent reason. In some countries, 50% of hives have committed this odd kind of suicide.  This is a disaster for humans as well as bees. The wee buzzing beasties pollinate roughly a third of our food supply; $200 billion worth of crops annually. If they were to die out completely, you might have to kiss goodbye to tomatoes, almonds, avocados, berries, beans, limes and lemons, to name but a few. (And if their extinction sounds unlikely, well, so did that of the great-tasting, ubiquitous passenger pigeon — until we shot the last one exactly a century ago.) See also: Honey Bees Trained to Detect Cancer on Patients\\' Breath Nobody knows exactly why the bees are getting confused; various reports have fingered particular pesticides, antibiotics and cellphone signals, or maybe all of the above. A big part of the problem: scientists don\\'t really know where honey bees are going when they die. That seems surprising: how can anything escape our attention on this GPS-driven, NSA-monitored planet? Couldn\\'t we just, you know, stick RFID chips on the bees?  As much as that seems like an idea that emerged after one too many bong hits, it makes scientific sense — and now a group of Australian researchers are trying it out. They\\'ve attached 0.1-inch-wide sensors, above, to the backs of 5,000 honey bees in Tasmania.  The chips will transmit location data in real time. (The researchers had to refrigerate the bees for a few minutes first, and shave the ones that were too hairy for the chips to stick).  \"This is a non-destructive process and the sensors appear to have no impact on the bee\\'s ability to fly and carry out its normal duties,\" said Dr. Paulo de Souza, who\\'s heading up the bee trials at Australia\\'s national science agency, known as the CSIRO, in a press release. \"Bees are social insects that return to the same point and operate on a very predictable schedule,\" de Souza added. \"Any change in their behaviour indicates a change in their environment. If we can model their movements, we\\'ll be able to recognize very quickly when their activity shows variation and identify the cause.\" The CSIRO\\'s ambition doesn\\'t stop at bees. The organization, one of the world\\'s largest scientific agencies, is aiming to shrink the RFID chips down to a mere tenth of a millimeter — so it can start tracking mosquitoes and fruit flies too.

       " ' Japan has slashed its whale catch target in the Antarctic by two-thirds in a bid to resume its annual whale hunt, which an international court ruled must stop. The revised program submitted Tuesday to the International Whaling Commission says Japan seeks to catch 333 minke whales each year between 2015 and 2027, down from an earlier target of 1,035 whales — 935 minke and 100 fin and humpback whales, the Fisheries Agency said. See also: Can Drones Save the Elephants? Japan also promised to publish its findings in scientific journals and share them in a database. It called for a review of the program by the IWC after the first six years. The agency said the hunts are needed to accurately estimate whale stocks and determine appropriate catch quotas. Agency officials said whales must be killed to examine their reproductive organs to gauge their age. Minke whales are not endangered. Whaling for research purposes is exempt from a 1986 international ban on commercial whaling that was imposed because of concerns over declining whale stocks. Japan has been conducting what it calls research whaling in hopes of proving that stocks are plentiful enough to allow a resumption of commercial hunts. But in March, the International Court of Justice ruled that the Antarctic program must stop because it wasn\\'t scientific, as Japan had claimed, and produced little actual research. The court also said Japan failed to explain why it needed to kill so many whales for its research.  Agriculture Minister Koya Nishikawa told reporters that the revised program factored in the issues cited in the court\\'s ruling. He said Japan is willing to revise the program as needed and address questions and concerns from the commission. \"We certainly may face questions,\" he said. \"We will try to provide thorough explanations so we can gain the understanding of each (IWC) member nation.\" Approval from the IWC\\'s scientific committee isn\\'t mandatory for Japan to resume its hunts, but it is likely to face intense scrutiny over whether it is complying with the court ruling. Opponents say Japan\\'s research hunts are actually a cover for commercial whaling. In the revision, Japan dropped plans to hunt fin and humpback whales after hardly catching any of those species over the past nine years. After steadily fulfilling an annual Antarctic catch target of 440 whales for 17 years, Japan more than doubled the quota to 935 minke whales in 2005. It came close to the new target the following year, but its catch has fallen since then, mainly because domestic demand for whale meat has declined significantly. Protests by the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd also contributed to the declining catch. The government has spent large amounts of tax money to sustain whaling operations.  ',\n",

       " ' WASHINGTON — In a charmed life of newspapering, Ben Bradlee seemed always to be in just the right place. The raspy-voiced, hard-charging editor who invigorated The Washington Post got an early break as a journalist thanks to his friendship with one president, John F. Kennedy, and became famous for his role in toppling another, Richard Nixon, in the Watergate scandal. Bradlee died at home Tuesday of natural causes, the Post reported. He was 93. See also: 40 Years After Resignation, Interviews Show Nixon\\'s Softer Side Ever the newsman and ever one to challenge conventional wisdom, Bradlee imagined his own obituary years earlier and found something within it to quibble over. \"Bet me that when I die,\" he wrote in his 1995 memoir, \"there will be something in my obit about how The Washington Post \\'won\\' 18 Pulitzer prizes while Bradlee was editor.\" That, he said, would be bunk. The prizes are overrated and suspect, he wrote, and it\\'s largely reporters, not newspapers or their editors, who deserve the credit.  Really and truly the end of an era: Ben Bradlee is dead. Newspapers will never be the same. http://t.co/u9GU71PD1M pic.twitter.com/0uk43OffBu — Lydia Polgreen (@lpolgreen) October 22, 2014  Yet the Post\\'s Pulitzer-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal is an inextricable part of Bradlee\\'s legacy, and one measure of his success in transforming the Post from a sleepy hometown paper into a great national one. As managing editor first and later as executive editor, Bradlee engineered the Post\\'s reinvention, bringing in a cast of talented journalists and setting editorial standards that brought the paper new respect. He endeared one of his grade-school teacher\\'s motto: \"Our best today; better tomorrow,\" “Put out the best, most honest newspaper you can today,” he said, according to The New York Times “and put out a better one the next day.” When Bradlee retired from the Post newsroom in 1991, then-publisher Donald Graham said: \"Thank God the person making decisions in the last 26 years showed us how to do it with verve and with guts and with zest for the big story and for the little story.\" With Watergate, Bradlee himself became a big part of a story that epitomized the glory days of newspapers — back before web sites, cable chatter and bloggers drove the talk of the day. Actor Jason Robards turned Bradlee into a box-office hit with his Oscar-winning portrayal of the editor in the 1976 movie \"All the President\\'s Men,\" which recounted the unraveling of Watergate under the reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Bradlee\\'s marriage in 1978 to Post star reporter Sally Quinn (his third) added more glamour to his image. He was one of the few to know the identity early on of the celebrated Watergate source dubbed Deep Throat, revealed publicly in 2005 to be FBI official W. Mark Felt.  Journalists remember Ben Bradlee http://t.co/x0k7zSHEi6 \"He forever altered our business.\" #BenBradlee pic.twitter.com/u19F7Jkbf2 — Poynter (@Poynter) October 22, 2014  \"I think he did a great service to society,\" Bradlee said after Felt\\'s role finally came out. In enduring partnership with publisher Katharine Graham, Bradlee took a stand for press freedom in 1971 by going forward with publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret study of the Vietnam War broken by The New York Times, against the advice of lawyers and the entreaties of top government officials. The ensuing legal battle went all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld the right of newspapers to publish the leaked papers. The Post\\'s decision to publish helped pave the way for all of the smaller, difficult ones that collectively produced the newspaper\\'s groundbreaking coverage of Watergate. Bradlee \"set the ground rules — pushing, pushing, pushing, not so subtly asking everyone to take one more step, relentlessly pursuing the story in the face of persistent accusations against us and a concerted campaign of intimidation,\" Katharine Graham recalled in her memoir. In November 2013, at age 92, Bradlee stood in the White House East Room and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, who saluted Bradlee for bringing an intensity and dedication to journalism that served as a reminder that \"our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press.\"  One of the giants. RIP Ben Bradlee. All guts and grit, always. http://t.co/5jp3vADh8D — Don Van Natta Jr. (@DVNJr) October 21, 2014  In a statement issued Tuesday night, Obama said Bradlee set a standard for honest, objective and meticulous reporting that encouraged many others to enter the profession. He called Bradlee a \"\"true newspaperman.\"  Quinn disclosed in September 2014 that her husband had suffered from Alzheimer\\'s disease for several years. She described him as happy to be fussed over and content even in decline. \"Ben has never been depressed a day in his life,\" Quinn said in a C-SPAN interview. Impatient, gruff, profane, Bradlee was all that. But also exuberant, innovative, charismatic. \"Ideas flew out of Ben,\" wrote Katharine Graham, who died in 2001. \"He was always asking important \\'why\\' questions. ... Ben was tough enough and good enough so that for the most part I not only let him do what he thought was right, I largely agreed with him.\" The low point in Bradlee\\'s career involved a 1981 Pulitzer for the Post that was rescinded after the Post itself revealed that reporter Janet Cooke had invented her story of an 8-year-old heroin user. Bradlee, whose offer to resign over the debacle was rejected, said it was a cross he would bear forever. Critics faulted editors for failing to ask enough questions about the story and said the incident was in part a reflection of the competition and tension within Bradlee\\'s newsroom. Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee was born Aug. 26, 1921, a Boston Brahmin reared in comfort but for family financial setbacks in the Depression and a six-month bout with polio at age 14. He hurried through Harvard in three years to take his place on a Pacific destroyer during World War II. On his return in 1945, he helped start a daily newspaper in New Hampshire, but it folded 2½ years later for lack of advertising. From there, Bradlee experienced a series of lucky breaks. He landed his first job at the Post in 1948 when a rainstorm in Baltimore prompted him to skip a job interview there and stay on the train to Washington. He happened to be riding a trolley car past Blair House in 1950 when Puerto Rican extremists opened fire on the presidential guest house while President Truman was staying there. Bradlee turned it into a page-one eyewitness story.  Ben Bradlee & JFK, November 10, 1963: #JFKL pic.twitter.com/CUDjwASKZW — Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) October 22, 2014  Restless at the Post, he left the paper in 1951 to become press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Two years later, he joined Newsweek\\'s Paris bureau and spent four years as a European correspondent before returning to Washington to write politics. He happened to buy a home in Georgetown in 1957, a few months before Sen. John F. Kennedy and his wife moved in across the street, the beginning of an intimate friendship and a proximity to power that burnished his credentials as a journalist and brought him rare insights into government. \"I was on a roll being in the right place at the right time, a luck that has stayed with me,\" Bradlee wrote in his best-selling memoir, \"A Good Life: Newspapers and Other Adventures.\" Long after his newspapering days were finished, even in his declining years, Bradlee would head over to the Post once a week to have lunch with \"the guys\" and \"talk about the good old days in journalism,\" Quinn recounted. Bradlee\\'s access to Kennedy continued through JFK\\'s presidency, bringing Bradlee scoops for Newsweek, and experiences that he ultimately turned into the 1975 book, \"Conversations with JFK.\" The release brought Bradlee much attention and cost him a valued friend, Jacqueline Kennedy, who thought the book a violation of privacy and stopped speaking to Bradlee. Bradlee had been in Newsweek\\'s Washington bureau four years when he found the nerve in 1961 to telephone Post publisher Philip Graham to propose that The Washington Post Co. buy Newsweek. \"It was the best telephone call I ever made — the luckiest, most productive, most exciting, most rewarding,\" Bradlee wrote. The deal came together and Bradlee ended up with a cache of Post stock and the title of Washington bureau chief for Newsweek. Four years later, it was a conversation with Philip Graham\\'s widow that proved pivotal for Bradlee. Katharine Graham had taken over the Post after her husband\\'s suicide and was looking to inject new life into the paper. In a quotation that has become Post lore, Bradlee told her over lunch that if the managing editor\\'s job ever opened up, \"I\\'d give my left one for it.\" Bradlee soon had the title of deputy managing editor and an understanding he would move up quickly. As recounted in Howard Bray\\'s book, \"The Pillars of the Post,\" managing editor Al Friendly cautioned Bradlee, \"Look, buster, don\\'t be in a hurry.\" Bradlee smiled and replied: \"Sorry, but that\\'s my metabolism.\" He succeeded Friendly three months later. Bradlee had four children from three marriages: Benjamin C. Jr., Dino, Marina and Quinn. His first two marriages, to Jean Saltonstall and Antoinette Pinchot, ended in divorce. Quinn Bradlee, his son with Sally Quinn, has battled a variety of ailments, including a hole in the heart and epilepsy, and was eventually diagnosed with a genetic syndrome called VCFS. Fellow journalists, politicos and fans took to Twitter to share their thoughts on Bradlee\\'s passing, as well as historical photos of the avid newspaperman:  Ben Bradlee published the Pentagon Papers knowing the @NYTimes was already under an unprecedented court-ordered injunction.

       " ' The blame game game between Netflix and Verizon is heating up. Netflix claims that its average prime time speeds over Verizon\\'s FiOS service dropped 14% last month. The company also produced the chart below to make its case that U.S. speeds are heading south: See also: 6 Great Alternatives to Netflix  Though accusations that Verizon is throttling Netflix have dogged Verizon since last year, the new data has prompted more Verizon customers to come forward to complain that their Netflix is slow or kaput.  Verizon has denied the claims, leading to a he said/she said standoff. What\\'s really going on? Here\\'s what we know: Why are consumers upset? #HouseofCards great but freezing every few minutes. #fios #netflix get along.— Craig Herrick (@CraigHerrick) February 21, 2014 \\xa0 Consumers pay Verizon to access the Internet. They pay Netflix for its content. However, some customers of Verizon\\'s FiOS said they have been unable to adequately stream Netflix. Verizon is not alone. Comcast has also drawn ire for slow Netflix speeds. It is also worth noting Comcast has been rolling out a data cap. There is little indication that slower speeds are experienced in certain areas, but slowdowns are generally associated with peak viewing hours on evenings and weekends. Whose fault is that? The answer depends on whom you ask. Netflix has published data that shows Verizon FiOS speed has been slowing.  Verizon has denied that it purposefully limited the speed with which Netflix is serving its customers, and claims that it treats all traffic equally. The company has noted publicly that various factors can affect Internet connection speeds, including local issues and peak demand times. One of the largest independent studies on the subject, which enlisted 30,000 volunteers over four days, found that Verizon\\'s speed was not notably different from its competitors. However, Janusz Jezowicz, who authored the study, said he could not say for certain that Verizon hadn\\'t limited Netflix traffic due to the complexity of the systems involved. So...nobody knows? No, not for sure. But that has not stopped various bloggers and media organizations from advancing some theories. The Wall Street Journal posted a story with the headline \"Feud Over Netflix Traffic Leads to Video Slowdown,\" which has been among the most aggressive articles to date in linking slowdowns in Netflix speeds to Verizon. Because Netflix drives so much traffic, it works with other Internet companies like Cogent Communications, which supplies additional bandwidth. Cogent works with ISPs like Verizon under money-free arrangements in which the amount of data sent between each company is about equal. However, Verizon claims that Cogent drives much more traffic than it takes, and does not want to pay for upgrades to infrastructure that could help handle the greater data load. Nor is Verizon agreeing to use Netflix\\'s own content distribution network called Open Connect, which is free for ISPs to use. What does that have to do with streaming Netflix? More people are streaming larger amounts of high quality video; the current infrastructure simply can\\'t handle it. By not paying to improve infrastructure with Cogent or agreeing to use Open Connect, Verizon has effectively drawn a line in the sand where it can attempt to rein in Netflix\\'s dominance of its bandwidth. Hence, Verizon would not technically be slowing Netflix traffic — but also not doing anything to alleviate the growing pains that are causing House of Cards fans to pull out their hair. Is this a big deal? There are near-constant tensions between companies that work together to serve customers, but this situation has particularly big ramifications for anyone who uses the Internet. Why? Two words: net neutrality. A quick refresher on net neutrality: All traffic on the Internet has traditionally been treated the same way. If you pay an ISP like Verizon, it should allow you to access Mashable with the same speed as you access Reddit. This rule was formalized by the Federal Communications Commission. Recently, that rule was struck down by a U.S. judge. While a new set of rules have been proposed, Verizon could now technically slow down your access to Netflix on purpose — something various parties have alleged is already happening. Since Netflix is dependent on ISPs to deliver its product into homes, Verizon could demand a cut of Netflix\\'s revenue in return for good or ever-preferential speeds. That seems kind of reasonable. Why should Verizon build infrastructure to help Netflix? The answer to this question has less to do with Netflix and Verizon in particular, and more to do with the future of the Internet. If Verizon was able to strike a deal with Netflix for improved speeds, my new startup — say, Jasonflix — would immediately start at a disadvantage. I would need far more capital to compete with Netflix from the start. Internet analysts say this would represent a major change from the web that brought us companies like Google, Facebook, Spotify, Netflix and even Mashable. The playing field that used to be flat would quickly become advantageous to the biggest players, stifling innovation. What does speed have to do with it? People who pay Verizon for its FiOS fiber optic connection expect a fast connection. Verizon claims its download speed for the basic FiOS connection starts at 15 megabits per second, which is right around the speed needed to stream high-definition video. It is important to note that speed and bandwidth are not the same thing, although the words are sometimes used interchangeably. Bandwidth actually more closely describes capacity, as this blog post points out. So while you might have a connection capable of 15 Mbps or more, that does not guarantee a great streaming experience. The number of people also using their connections — as well as how much bandwidth they are using — affects speeds. Think of it like a freeway where the average speed is 60 mph where there are still traffic jams at rush hour. Is there a definite way to know what affects speeds? Yes, but we don\\'t have access to it. Right now, ISPs like Verizon are not required to divulge data related to Internet traffic, although they could be if new net neutrality rules are passed. What should you do if Verizon throttles your Netflix account? Write a letter to your congresspeople supporting the new FCC net neutrality rules and send an email to your ISP threatening to cancel your service if these problems are not resolved. If that doesn\\'t work, research some other high-speed Internet options in your area to sustain your House of Cards addiction. If all else fails, vent on Twitter. At least you\\'ll have company.  Update, February 21, 2014, 5:40pm Not long after this piece was published, Gigaom posted a story citing evidence from Github that the peering issues between Comcast and Netflix appear to have been resolved.        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' In smartphones, there are features, and there\\'s flash. The Amazon Fire phone has its share of both: The quasi-3D display is pretty compelling, but the jury is still out on how much of a novelty it is. An undoubtedly important Fire phone feature for everyday users, however, is the fact that you get unlimited cloud storage for all the photos you take with it. Offering free, unlimited photo storage for every photo you take on a smartphone is unprecedented. Although many apps offer automatic photo (and sometimes video) uploads, there\\'s usually either a storage limit (go over it and you start paying) or some other caveat (such as a maximum resolution).  At 1 terabyte (1,000GB) of free storage, Flickr comes pretty close to unlimited for most practical purposes. But it doesn\\'t come preloaded on any phones — you need to download the app and register. See also: 25 Most-Followed Users on Instagram [PICS] Amazon is the first smartphone vendor to offer free, out-of-the-box cloud storage for every single photo you ever take with the phone. It\\'s a very consumer-friendly move — and while Amazon\\'s competitors have been inching in that direction, no one else has taken the plunge. Picture this slippery slope The reason is simple: It would be very easy to abuse such a feature. Cloud backup for smartphone photos is meant to back up photos actually taken with the phone. But the camera roll on a smartphone also needs to be accessible by other apps (indeed, Apple recently announced it would make the iPhone\\'s camera roll even more connectable than it already is in iOS 8 to satisfy developer desires). Many of those apps are essentially bridges between the phone and a wireless-enabled camera. That way, you can take high-quality photos with, say, a DSLR, and relay them (either via the camera\\'s own Wi-Fi or an Eye-Fi card) to your device so you can then share them on services such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and all other digital communities where people share photos. You can see where this is going. A photo service that grants unlimited free storage (as Amazon\\'s purportedly does) opens the door to gaming the system — it\\'s a relatively simple exercise to ensure every photo you take from any camera is uploaded to the service.  This is a photo archivist\\'s dream: all photos — whether RAW, JPEG or anything else — all stored in the cloud, forever, at no charge. Even Flickr charges for such a service (you needed to have the now locked-down Flickr Pro to go truly unlimited). Amazon doesn\\'t. The company\\'s FAQ on the subject doesn\\'t reveal any fine-print caveats, and when we asked Amazon directly, a company rep said there are no resolution or size restrictions, or any artificial storage limits.  While Amazon will monitor for potential abuse, it expects the majority of Fire phone owners will fall within a \"normal range of usage.\" Is so-called abuse even something to fear, though? The multiple-camera scenario is certainly bending the rules, but given how few people would actually partake in it and the relative cheapness of cloud storage, Amazon can probably afford to absorb the outliers who will take advantage of its free service.  And given the lack of other tools, Amazon\\'s photo cloud probably won\\'t challenge Flickr for the attentions of professional photographers. Who\\'s next? Now that Amazon has dived into free photo storage, will its competitors step up?  Apple has already outlined its plans for iCloud Photo Library — and although its rates are cheap, they\\'re not free. Google already backs up all your photos to Google+ for free, but not at full resolution. The company will have an opportunity to respond at Google I/O next week. Microsoft may be the company best positioned to match Amazon\\'s offer. Windows Phone still has relatively low market share compared with iOS and Android, and the company has a strong cloud platform in Azure and OneDrive.  Given the fact that the draw of many Windows Phones is the camera, Microsoft could earn a lot of customer loyalty by guaranteeing that all photos are automatically backed up, for free. One thing\\'s for sure: It will take a while before video follows photos into unlimited-storage territory. There\\'s almost no upper limit to how much space a video can take up. Guaranteeing that every video gets stored — no matter how long or how high-res — is going to take generational jumps in storage and connection speeds. But for now, Amazon\\'s offering has no equivalent, and it solves a big pain point for consumers. Who hasn\\'t needed to delete a bunch of old photos to clear out space on their phone? Amazon has pointed the way to a photo-friendly future, and it would be surprising if the rest of the tech world doesn\\'t follow sooner or later.  ',\n",

       " ' The nose may really \"know\" when it comes to danger, according to a new study that found that odors associated with electric shocks in mice trigger a sensory-cell reaction much stronger than for non-fearful odors. The finding was surprising, said study researcher John McGann, a neuroscientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. The sensory neurons are at the very beginning of the circuit that enables the perception of smell, far outside of conscious control, and yet they \"learn\" to tune into scary smells. \"The effects of learning can happen not just on behavior, but on sensory processing,\" McGann told LiveScience.  SEE ALSO: Tip of the Tongue: The 7 (Other) Flavors Humans May Taste  Learning Fear Researchers have long known that associative learning — the talent of associating one stimulus with another — changes processing in the brain so that, for example, the ability to differentiate between one type of scent and another becomes more sensitive. But most people tend to think that the sensory nerves that sit in the nose and directly contact the chemicals that make up scents are one-trick ponies. A smell comes along; the neurons duly note it and inform the brain; and the brain does the hard work of remembering what that scent means. Not so, the new study reveals. The sensory neurons adapt, too. \"The earlier we look the earlier we find influences of learning,\" McGann said. The researchers used relatively new techniques to spy on mouse olfactory (smell) sensory neurons. They used mice that had been genetically engineered to have olfactory sensory neurons that fluoresce when active. The fluorescence provides colorful evidence the neurons are releasing neurotransmitters, the chemical signals these cells use to communicate. The researchers placed these mice in metal-floored enclosures and pumped in two smells, both simple one-chemical esters. One smelled rather fruity, the other a bit like nail polish remover. For each mouse, one of the smells presaged an unpleasant electrical shock to the feet from the enclosure floor. After the mice had learned to associate the smell with the shock, the researchers anesthetized them and exposed them to the smells again, watching under a microscope to see how their olfactory neurons responded compared with unfamiliar smells. Priming the Nose They found that scary smells had a large effect: The neurons released far more neurotransmitters when exposed to the shock-associated scent. It was as if the mice had been exposed to the smell at four times the concentration than they really were, McGann said. \"The circuit became hypersensitive to that odor,\" he said. The finding makes sense, McGann said. Becoming hypersensitive to the scent of danger could save a mouse\\'s life, particularly if that sensitivity gets the rodent out of the path of, say, a hungry cat. But it\\'s also exciting and unexpected, he said, because the finding shows that even basic sensory neurons respond to learning in this way. The aural equivalent, McGann said, would be like having a microphone that automatically turned up the volume in response to important sounds. Of course, researchers don\\'t know whether the ears or eyes have similarly adaptable nerve cells. Nor do they know whether smells can be associated with emotions other than fear. Those are harder experiments, McGann said. \"We know how to scare a mouse,\" he said. \"It\\'s harder to know how to make a mouse really, really happy.\" Another outstanding question is whether human noses have the same responses to scary smells — and if our other sensory systems act the same way. It\\'s possible, McGann said. Some people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are hypersensitive to stimuli that remind them of their trauma. Such sensitivity could very well start at the most primitive levels. \"Maybe, and I emphasize the maybe, that\\'s analogous to what\\'s happening in these mice,\" McGann said. The researchers now plan to test whether they can reverse the sensory learning by training the mice not to associate the scary smell with a shock anymore.

       " \" Harper's magazine, which has been ambivalent about joining the digital revolution, is releasing its first app this week. David Jacobs, the CEO of 29th Street Publishing, the developer of the app, says it will hit the App Store on Friday. An Android version will come later on. Harper's, which launched in 1850, plans to offer the new app alongside an iPad-ready version of the magazine from Zinio that has been available for years. The title will also be available on Apple's Newsstand for $21.99.  See also: Harper's Magazine Is Finally Ready for the Digital Revolution For most magazines, releasing an app isn't a big deal, but Harper's has taken a walled-garden approach to offering its digital content. Most content on Harper's website is only available to subscribers. The approach differs greatly from The Atlantic, a longtime rival that gives away all of its digital content and has embraced a pageview-driven business model with its Atlantic Wire sub-brand. The Atantic claims that its affiliated sites bring in about 20 million unique visitors a month. Harper's doesn't disclose its traffic numbers. Image: Flickr, Boston Public Library \",\n",
       " ' Massachusetts State Police released five images taken of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\\'s hiding spot after he was discovered in a boat parked in a Watertown, Mass. backyard. The boat\\'s owner was the first to find Tsnarnaev in the boat, calling police to report his discovery shortly thereafter. The first three images were taken using thermal cameras, which are designed to pick up the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such technology is often used by police to locate suspects and by the military to isolate targets, as human body heat is particularly recognizable when juxtaposed with objects that aren\\'t giving off nearly the same amount of heat.      The images were taken by the Massachusetts State Police Air Wing, per the department\\'s Twitter account:  Air Wing views from Watertown manhunt. 5 total pics released.No further info available tonight on pictures twitter.com/MassStatePolic… — MASS STATE POLICE (@MassStatePolice) April 20, 2013  Police air support played a key role in Friday\\'s operations, which resulted in Tsarnaev being taken into custody badly hurt, but alive. \"Our helicopter had actually detected the subject in the boat,\" Massachusetts State Police Col. Timothy Alben said as quoted by NBC News. \"We have what\\'s called a FLIR — a forward-looking infrared device — on that helicopter. It picked up the heat signature of the individual, even though he was underneath what appeared to be the \\'shrink wrap\\' or cover on the boat itself. There was movement from that point on. The helicopter was able to direct the tactical teams over to that area.\" The latter images also seem to show the boat\\'s tarp was removed with a tool attached to a specialized law enforcement vehicle, not a robot as police said earlier.

       " ' Americans are leaving money on the table — in the form of unused vacation time. Employees who receive paid time off use 51% of it, on average. That\\'s according to a survey run by Harris Poll for the jobs website Glassdoor. See also: Danish Company Offers Prizes to Residents Who Go on Vacation and Have Sex The survey did find some good news: 85% of Americans who receive paid vacation or time off took at least some of it in the past 12 months, and 25% of survey respondents took all their eligible time off. Taking time off doesn’t always mean vacation, though. Eleven percent of employees said they used time off to interview for another job, while 61% said they did at least some work while they were away from the office. “It’s clear the word vacation among employers and employees doesn’t mean what it did in the past,” said Glassdoor’s Rusty Rueff. “Before technology allowed us to be connected 24/7, we were more likely to have actually ‘vacated’ our work for a couple of weeks a year, but now, it appears one full day away is a luxury.” One explanation for why employees don\\'t take the time off they have earned: concern about the security of their job. However, the survey found that confidence in the job market has increased; 44% of employees “believe it is likely they could find a job matched to their experience and compensation in the next six months if they lost their job.\" Concerns about layoffs are at their lowest level in five years: Only 15% of surveyed employees reported concerns about being laid off in the next six months, and 23% reported concerns about co-workers being laid off.

       " ' St. Louis Cardinals supporters proclaim that they are the \"best fans in baseball.\"  That notion has already been mocked by many, but a small segment of Cardinals fans further embarrassed their brethren in shocking new form on Monday night.  See also: Even Turkish Soccer Fans Are Protesting With Ferguson At game 3 of the Cardinals\\' MLB playoff series against the Dodgers in St. Louis, a group protested outside Busch Stadium to continue drawing attention to the fact that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson has not yet been charged for the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August. The protestors were met by despicable behavior from Cardinals fans at the game, who hurled racist taunts at the group and supportive messages for Wilson. The video footage is 25 minutes long, but watching just a few minutes will give you the idea.  A few choice moments, as noted by Deadspin:  When a \"Let\\'s go Cardinals\" chant briefly morphs into \"Let\\'s go Darren\" at about the 2:40 mark. When a blond-haired white woman holding a beer yells, \"We\\'re the ones who fucking gave all y\\'all the freedoms that you got.\" From the 16:00 to the 17:00 mark, when a man yells at protesters to \"get a job.\" Shortly after, several fans started chanting \"USA! USA! USA!\" while one woman chanted \"Africa! Africa! Africa!\"  Plenty of pro sports teams have bad-apple fans who make racist remarks, but this paints a truly grotesque picture. On one side, there are sports fans drinking beer outside an expensive entertainment spectacle while hurling racist insults. On the other side, there are American citizens who don\\'t want to see the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer pass without charges and a fair trial.  Don\\'t let a few bad apples spoil the bunch, but it\\'s hard to root for the Cardinals after seeing this.

       " ' SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California will no longer be the last Western state with a pump-as-you-please approach to groundwater. Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation on Tuesday overhauling the state\\'s management of its groundwater supply, bringing it in line with other states that have long regulated their wells. See also: California Drought Is Worst Since at Least 1895, Data Shows Groundwater, which can take hundreds or thousands of years to recharge after being depleted, makes up nearly 60% of California\\'s water use during dry years. But it is not monitored and managed the same way as water from reservoirs and rivers. Supporters of the legislation say the worst drought in a generation inspired them to rethink the state\\'s hands-off approach to tapping wells, which has led to sinking land and billions of dollars in damage to aquifers, roads and canals. \"This is a big deal,\" Brown said at the signing ceremony in his office. \"It has been known about for decades that underground water has to be managed and regulated in some way.\" The package signed into law requires some local governments and water districts to begin managing their wells, and it authorizes state water agencies to intervene if necessary. It also allows for water metering and fines to monitor and enforce restrictions. SB1168, SB1319 and AB1739 by Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, D-Sacramento, and Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, passed in the final days of the legislative session over objections from Republican lawmakers and Central Valley Democrats. The opposition was driven by agricultural interests that are increasingly dependent on pumping from wells as reservoirs dry up and government water allocations plunge in the drought. They say the legislation was rushed and punishes well-managed agencies while infringing on property rights. \"While there is legitimate concern about the over-drafting of some groundwater basins, this massive expansion of state authority will not solve the problem,\" said Assembly Minority Leader Connie Conway, R-Tulare. Brown said in a signing message he would push for legislation next year to streamline resolutions in disputes over groundwater rights. Unlike other states that treat groundwater as a shared resource, California property owners have been entitled to tap water beneath their land since the Gold Rush days. See also: California Drought Causes Largest Water Loss in State History Lawmakers supporting the groundwater overhaul say the existing system pits farmers against each other in a costly race to dig the deepest wells, resulting in depleted aquifers. Brown cautioned that years of disagreements and arguments are ahead in regulating groundwater. The new laws, which take effect in January, target areas where groundwater basins are being depleted faster than they are being replenished to be sustainable by 2040. It gives local land planners two years to create a groundwater sustainability agency, which in turn has up to five years to develop a plan for managing wells and pumping. The state Water Resources Control Board would step in and develop plans for communities that fail to abide by these rules. The National Weather Service found in August that California\\'s current drought is its worst since 1895, based on the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index.  A study from the University of California, Irvine, found that the drought was causing the \"greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California agriculture ever seen.\" It also projected that the drought\\'s total cost to the state would be $2.2 billion.   10 Photos of the Devestating California Drought        California Drought Dries Up Bay Area Reservoirs A car sits in dried and cracked earth of what was the bottom of the Almaden Reservoir on Jan. 28, 2014 in San Jose, California.

       " ' The Newsroom ends, but the show goes on.  That\\'s what we\\'re left with in the final shot of Sunday\\'s series finale: Jeff Daniels as Will McAvoy, back at his desk (sans cigarettes) ready to do The News.  See also: 18 New TV Shows to Watch This Fall Sure, some things have changed. Pregnant McKenzie is now the news director at ACN. Maggie and Jim love each other. So do Sloan and Don. Neal is back and more self assured. But really, it\\'s the same old crew doing the same show.  As a journalist, that might be the one thing that felt real about the show\\'s finale. No matter the momentous changes in personal lives, the show must go on. There\\'s always another story, another interview. Like playing tennis against a wall, you don\\'t ever win the news; you just keeping swinging. The show\\'s main struggle has also changed only cosmetically from its start. The staff of Will\\'s show News Night is still trying to do The News. At the beginning, it was struggling against ratings. Now it\\'s battling the technorati playboy that bought ACN, the fictional network on The Newsroom, and wants it to begin running listicles like “the Ten Most Overrated Movies Ever.”  Unfortunately, that struggle will remain much discussed but mostly untouched. In three seasons, the show seemed only to point out that this battle exists. It is a show that got on the highest of horses about media and journalism in the modern age without even breaking it into a trot.  The final season of the Newsroom evolved in almost bizarre concert with real life events, and Sunday was no exception.  The show’s creator, executive producer and writer Aaron Sorkin took to the op-ed pages of The New York Times to voice his displeasure with how the media had turned leaked Sony emails into stories. Sorkin argues that journalists helped the hackers behind the recent Sony hack by writing stories based on leaked emails. In doing so, he seems to insinuate that those who have written on this are in cahoots with people who have threatened murder. It includes this little doozy: As a screenwriter in Hollywood who\\'s only two generations removed from probably being blacklisted, I\\'m not crazy about Americans calling other Americans un-American, so let\\'s just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable. Lumping together every single media outlet with those Sorkin finds most odious is a blatant reminder that the person who just finished three seasons of television about an American newsroom seems to know nothing about American newsrooms. Sorkin might as well have decried \"the lamestream media\" and started his own network.  With that understanding, The Newsroom makes far more sense. Sorkin has always been something of a modern Norman Rockwell, painting pictures of Americana that resemble how a simple person might wish for things to be rather than how they are.  That falls apart quickly when confronted with real world situations like the Sony leaks. To be clear, there are plenty of examples of media outlets pushing stories from the leaks that are at best borderline. But one of Sorkin’s examples is a Huffington Post story about how the leaks help illustrate a diversity problem in Hollywood. That seems awfully newsworthy to me. Just like in The Newsroom, instead of any nuanced discussion, we are treated to some finger wagging from Sorkin. \"As demented and criminal as it is, at least the hackers are doing it for a cause. The press is doing it for a nickel,\" he finishes in the article.  MacKenzie McHale would be ashamed of us. ',\n",

An architect praises FiftyThree\\'s Paper app, while one woman says Airbnb \"saved my life.\" The video then moves on to several niche apps that get less attention. An ocean advocate discusses the usefulness of Marine Debris Tracker, and a student praises Biosim, an app that works with his bionic hand. Overall, the video is a powerful reminder of the wide range of apps that have popped up in the last six years — and the equally wide range of people whose lives are impacted by them. ',\n",
       " ' Microsoft will close its direct-to-Xbox entertainment branch as part of its extensive layoffs of up to 18,000 people announced Thursday, ending many plans for original programming targeting the gaming demographic. Re/code reported the news of the closure first as rumor, which was confirmed by Xbox chief Phil Spencer. The some 200 employees in the entertainment branch are included in the layoffs announced earlier. See also: The 15 Best Free iPad Games Spencer told Re/code that executives like Nancy Tellum, who was brought on from CBS in 2012 to start Xbox Entertainment Studios, will remain on to finish projects already in production. Tellum showed the studio\\'s first project, a series based on Halo directed by Stephen Spielberg, at the Xbox One console reveal in 2013. Since then, several other projects have been announced, like a Halo digital series directed by Ridley Scott and a documentary on the Atari games buried in the New Mexico desert. This decision to cut Xbox Entertainment Studios reflects the recent pivot Xbox has undergone. The console originally launched as an \"all-in-one games and entertainment system,\" but that seems to be a strategy in flux in response to the large market lead by Sony\\'s PlayStation 4. During this year\\'s E3, Microsoft focused its entire message on games, excluding any entertainment experience.  This contrasts with Sony, which announced it was entering the streaming entertainment business at E3 this year, with the creation of a digital streaming series based on the comic book Powers. ',\n",

       " ' A new portrait of the Milky Way\\'s neighbor, Andromeda, shows our twin galaxy as we\\'ve never seen it before — thanks to a new instrument on Japan\\'s Subaru telescope at the summit of Hawaii\\'s Mauna Kea. The instrument, called the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC), provides sharp images of the cosmos across a wide field of view. The new photo demonstrates that the HSC camera makes good on its promise of offering his-resolution views of objects throughout the telescope\\'s large 1.5-degree field of view. SEE ALSO: Stunning Photos of Our Milky Way Galaxy \"This first image from HSC is truly exciting,\" Masahiro Takada, chair of the HSC science working group at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Japan, said in a statement. \"We can now start the long-awaited, largest-ever galaxy survey for understanding the evolutionary history and fate of the expanding universe.\" Only 2.5 million light-years away, Andromeda, also known as M31, is the closest spiral galaxy to Earth, and is thought to be similar to our own galaxy. This bright galaxy is visible as a faint splotch on the sky to the naked eye, and was first written about in 964 A.D. by the Persian astronomer al-Sufi. The Subaru Telescope snapped this new image of Andromeda as part of its process to check out the HSC instrument before it is open for scientific use. SEE ALSO: How to Find Andromeda Astronomers plan to use the HSC to take a cosmic census of every galaxy across a wide swath of sky, probing in depth to peer back through the cosmic eons. The census will record galaxy shapes for a study on how massive objects bend light through their gravitational pull in a process called gravitational lensing. \"Such data will allow scientists to map the distribution of dark matter, constrain the nature of dark energy and search for baby galaxies that were just born in the early universe,\" Takada said. SEE ALSO: Stacking Up the 10 Biggest Telescopes on Earth By analyzing galaxies that are gravitationally lensed, astronomers can study how much matter is in the universe and develop a better understanding of its invisible component: dark matter. They also hope to probe the strange entity, called dark energy, that is causing the expansion of space to accelerate. \"The sharp resolution in the current image augurs the instrument’s capabilities for capturing weak lensing, which is central to HSC\\'s scientific goals of surveying the parameters and properties of dark matter and dark energy in the universe as well as exploring the causes of the accelerating expansion of the universe,\" Satoshi Miyazaki, director of the HSC project, said in a statement.

       " ' Al-Qaeda\\'s affiliate in Yemen is threatening to kill an American hostage kidnapped over a year ago and has given Washington three days to meet several unspecified demands, a U.S. terrorism monitoring group said Thursday. The SITE Intelligence Group said it obtained a video by Yemen\\'s al-Qaeda offshoot featuring the hostage, identified as 33-year-old Luke Somers, an American photojournalist born in Britain. See also: Al-Qaeda escapes with American and Briton before special forces raid in Yemen Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from a street in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, where he had worked as a photojournalist for the Yemen Times. He was likely among a group of hostages who were the objective of a joint rescue mission by U.S operation forces and Yemeni troops last month that freed eight captives in a remote corner of Yemen. At the time, a Yemeni official said the mission failed to liberate five others, including an American journalist and a Briton who were moved elsewhere by their al-Qaeda captors days before the raid. The American was not identified by name and Yemen did not officially confirm the participation of U.S. commandos in the rescue mission — a rare instance of U.S. forces intervening on the ground in Yemen. The three-minute video released by SITE on Thursday first shows a local al-Qaeda figure, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, reading in Arabic and speaking about alleged American crimes against the Muslim world. Al-Ansi gives the U.S. three days to meet al-Qaeda\\'s demands or \"otherwise the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate.\" He does not specify the demands but says Washington is \"aware\" of them. Then Somers is shown, giving a brief statement in English and asking for help. \"It\\'s now been well over a year since I\\'ve been kidnapped in Sanaa,\" Somers said. \"Basically, I\\'m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I\\'m certain that my life is in danger.\" Impoverished Yemen, troubled both by al-Qaeda and the advance of Shiite rebels, has seen foreigners increasingly targeted in kidnap attempts. The U.S. drone strikes, targeting suspected militant gatherings, have become increasingly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties. ',\n",

       " ' VILONIA, Arkansas — Three years to the day after one of the deadliest and most prolific outbreaks of tornadoes in U.S. history, another devastating tornado claimed at least 10 lives in several communities in Arkansas. It began Sunday afternoon, when the National Weather Service issued a PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) tornado watch for west-central Arkansas. We positioned ourselves south of the Arkansas River, west of Little Rock, where the tornado initially formed and grew into a mile wide wedge. See also: Aerial Drone Footage Shows Extent of Central U.S. Tornado Destruction A massive tornado forms over the Arkansas River, west of Little Rock, Ark., before growing into a mile wide wedge.Image:  Greg Johnson/TornadoHunter.com The storm — and the massive tornado it spawned — continued moving northeast toward Mayflower and eventually Vilonia. The Storm Prediction Center advised that any tornado formed in this volatile atmospheric mix could easily become a \"long track\" tornado, capable of destroying entire neighborhoods. That prediction would prove to be devastatingly true. A tornado that struck Vilonia, Ark. on April 27, 2014 leaves a path of destruction.Image:  Greg Johnson/TornadoHunter.com My team member, Ricky Forbes, and I arrived just minutes after the storm leveled Vilonia, and it was apparent that the damage was absolute. It was easily on par with the extensive F4 and F5 damage that we had witnessed at scenes like Moore, Okla. and Joplin, Mo. in recent years. We immediately went into first-responder mode, as already there was a group of storm refugees waiting for help. Most of the people whose lives were immediately affected by the massive twister were quiet and generally in a state of shock. Helicopters circled overhead, and emergency personnel flooded the streets. A helicopter is seen circling over the flattened town of Vilonia, Ark., late on Sunday, April 27, 2014.Image:  Greg Johnson/TornadoHunter.com And we soon began hearing a series of incredible stories of survival — like the father who brought his three girls into the bathtub when the warning was issued. That bathtub was ripped from the house and it rolled several yards from the home, with dad and all four girls still huddled inside. Or the scene where we pulled rubble off of the basement access and three families emerged unscathed, including a small baby. Off-duty firemen and police filled the streets, all lending a hand while strangers hugged, shared water and comforted those less fortunate. My driver, Dave Squires from Saskatchewan, Canada, sat on the ground for an hour and a half stabilizing an injured woman\\'s head and neck, while emergency personnel continued to sift through the incredible scene of devastation, searching desperately for others in need. As the evening wore into the early hours, it grew apparent that not everyone would survive the storm. There would undoubtedly be stories of tragedy and loss. See also: Storm-Penetrating Drones Could Fly Into Tornadoes I don\\'t remember many names — things happened way too quickly as we moved from one person to the next. We exchanged polite thank yous and had brief moments of tears and laughter. But I do remember a few heroic moments, when people could be heard calling for help stuck beneath the rubble, and searchers frantically lifted away debris from the remnants of countless homes and businesses to save them. Sadly, Monday is shaping up to be yet another round of severe weather focused over Mississippi and Alabama. For the people of Vilonia, Sunday\\'s tornado arrived in an eerily similar manner to the April 25 tornado from 2011 that killed 4 and devastated the small community north of Little Rock. Our hearts go out to all those affected by the storms.

       " ' For a time on Wednesday, the world thought two or maybe three shooters were terrorizing Ottawa\\'s Parliament Hill. Ultimately, police say, a lone gunman was responsible. See also: Video Captures Gunfire Exchange in Canadian Parliament Building But the Ottawa Police did tell reporters they were looking for multiple suspects as the confusion unfolded on Wednesday. And word of multiple shooters was sent to staffers who worked in the Parliament buildings, too. The media, quickly, fell in line. CNN, citing the police, reported that there were \"2 or 3\" assailants.  Image: CNNSitRoomIn Canada, the CBC reported it, too. And The Globe and Mail, which was praised for its coverage, said that police were \"in pursuit of multiple shooters.\" The Wall Street Journal even tweeted the report as confirmed.  Ottawa police confirm that there were multiple suspects in the shooting, saying there were \"possibly 3\" shooters. http://t.co/In9OgOxYXM — Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 22, 2014  CBS News did as well.  NEW: There are currently multiple suspects at large in the Ottawa shooting -@OttawaPolice — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) October 22, 2014  And The New York Times initially led its coverage with the phrase, \"At least two gunmen.\" Now, it says, there was just one, and there is no correction on the original article.  .@nytimes says “at least two gunmen\" were involved in today’s #Ottawa shootings: http://t.co/x21wMdnoYJ pic.twitter.com/caYZMuAWRQ — Daniel Wein (@danielwein) October 22, 2014  \"We regularly update online breaking news stories for the print paper,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the paper, told Mashable when we inquired about the website\\'s changes. \"The current version of our story reflects that the initial number of shooters reported by authorities has changed and does not require a correction.\" The Times also edited a Facebook post that was still citing \"at least two gunmen\" after we asked about it. Ottawa police have since corrected the record, too, with Constable Marc Soucy telling the Associated Press that police believe there was only one gunman, despite all the initial reports to the contrary.  CBC: Police statement pulls back from what was earlier being reported. Possible that this was a lone gunman, not multiple. #ottawa — Andy Carvin (@acarvin) October 22, 2014  \"We’re satisfied at this point one individual was responsible for the shooting yesterday on the Hill,\" Chief Charles Bordeleau told CBC News, a clarification that came nearly 24 hours after the shootings. Rumors of multiple assailants continue to appear in the immediate hours after high-profile shootings. Call it a symptom of the chaos. In these situations, police are also trying to cover their bases and make sure there isn\\'t a second gunman on the loose. In Ottawa, parts of downtown were locked down for hours after the shootings as police scoured the area. But sometimes in the confusion, the search for any possible other shooters quickly translates into a search for \"suspects,\" or \"suspects at large,\" or \"gunmen involved.\" Rumors and conspiracy theories about multiple accomplices are still a part of the Kennedy assassination lore — a second shooter on the grassy knoll — as well as more recent shootings like those at Sandy Hook Elementary and the Washington Navy Yard. All of those cases, and many others, proved to be the work of a lone gunman. At Sandy Hook, police briefly detained a few bystanders, which added to the rumors. \"Were there other people detained? The answer is yes,\" Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told Salon. \"In the height of battle, until you’ve determined who, what, when, where and why of everyone in existence … that’s not unusual.\" In the case of the Navy Yard, \"several witnesses, callers, and the limited video from the scene provided conflicting or additional information that suggested the possibility of additional suspects,\" according to a 2014 report from the Police Executive Research Forum. In the end, it\\'s uncommon for high-profile shootings to be the work of multiple gunmen (the Columbine High School shootings being one notable exception). According to a January 2010 report prepared by the Counterterrorism Bureau of the New York City Police Department, the NYPD analyzed more than 200 active shooter cases that resulted in at least one casualty in the United States since 1966 and found that 98% of them were carried out by a single attacker.  If the reports of multiple shooters do hold true during an attack, a number of police departments have begun to incorporate a concept called the Multi-Assault Counter Terrorism Action Capabilities (MACTAC), following the Mumbai terrorist attacks that left nearly 200 dead when members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamic terror group, attacked civilians across the Indian city in 2008.  MACTAC is an expansion of a police tactic called Immediate Action Rapid Deployment (IARD) that provides responding officers with dynamic tactics to use during an incident involving multiple shooters at multiple locations, according to a September 2013 paper by Joel M. Justice, a captain in the Los Angeles Police Department.  \"The MACTAC concept allows combining of personnel from multiple agencies during operations to assist the local jurisdiction responding to a Mumbai-type terrorist attack,\" he says. As for Ottawa, court records appear to show that the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a petty criminal with a rap sheet, featuring a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses and other crimes. A friend told Canadian media that Zehaf-Bibeau wanted to go to Libya to study Arabic.

First, however, behold the bizarre spectacle:  Rob Carr/Getty Images Now that you\\'ve soaked that in, here\\'s the deal: The Eagles\\' new coach is Chip Kelly, who brings his high-powered, super-speedy offense with him to Philadelphia from the University of Oregon. But all that on-field explosiveness takes some advanced disguising to work without opposing defenses stealing plays. So, instead of using hand signals or some other means of communication, Kelly and his coaching staff use oversized cards of random people and personalities to signal on-field tactics.

       " ' Ever since Apple introduced the original iPhone in 2007, it has adhered to a standard formula: Introduce one updated model the following year, discount the previous model and kill off models that are more than two year old. This year, Apple decided to shake things up by introducing two new iPhone models, discontinuing the iPhone 5, but keeping the 4S as free with a contract.  \"In the past, when we\\'ve announced a new iPhone, we\\'ve lowered the price of the current iPhone making it even more accessible to more people. But this year, we\\'re not going to do that,\" Tim Cook, Apple\\'s CEO, said during the company\\'s big iPhone event on Tuesday. \"The business has become so large that this year we are going to replace the iPhone 5. And we are going to replace it with not one, but two new designs.\" See also: How the Smartphone Market Has Changed Since the iPhone 5 There had been plenty of rumors leading up to the event that Apple would introduce a lower-cost model called the 5C in addition to updating the iPhone 5. The decision to kill off the iPhone 5 was a bit of a surprise, though it\\'s reminiscent of how Apple handled its iPad product line late last year.  Still, it raises the obvious question: what does Apple gain from introducing the 5C that it wouldn\\'t get from simply keeping the iPhone 5 and introducing the 5S. The short answer is that Apple now has a variety of colorful new phones that are more affordable at launch than any iPhone it has ever introduced, with the hope being that it will be able to attract a wider range of consumers. \"The broader the price range you can present to the market, the more people you are going to get,\" Van L. Baker, VP and research director with Gartner, told Mashable. Cook seemed to allude to this during the keynote, noting that multiple new iPhone models \"allows us to serve even more customers.\" While Apple continues to perform well in the high end of markets in the U.S. and elsewhere, the iPhone\\'s share of the global smartphone market has declined year-over-year, according to IDC, as competitors have introduced more affordable alternatives for the low- and mid-tier market. For China in particular — a country that Apple expects to be its largest market one day — some analysts estimate Apple\\'s share of the market has been halved as consumers there gravitate toward cheaper products.   A lower-cost iPhone would, in theory, help Apple attract more customers in China and other emerging markets, but analysts now question whether the price Apple set for it is low enough to really make a difference. According to Apple\\'s website, the iPhone 5C starts at $99 with a contract and $549 without, compared to $199 for the 5S on contract and $649 without. Analysts and investors had been hoping the 5C would price in the $400-$500 range to be more competitive.  In China, the iPhone 5C starts at the equivalent of $733, or about $100 cheaper than the previous iPhone 5. That may attract some consumers who were on the fence, but Baker suggests the device won\\'t be \"market expanding\" unless Apple can get it on China Mobile, the country\\'s largest carrier, and knock the price down a bit. (It\\'s also worth noting, as some have pointed out, that Apple is still advertising the iPhone 4 in China, which could prove to be a cheaper option for consumers in the country.) \"We would have liked to have seen something lower, but it will help,\" Baker says about the price of the iPhone 5C. \"It will gain some additional market share, it\\'s just a question of is it enough?\"    Apple Sept. 10 iPhone Event        Tim Cook Onstage Apple CEO Tim Cook opens the event.

       " ' BERLIN — Sony is the latest company vying for a spot on your wrist, and it\\'s banking on voice control to win that coveted real estate.  The Japanese manufacturer launched at the IFA 2014 tech conference in Berlin on Wednesday two new wearables: its third-generation smartwatch, appropriately called SmartWatch 3, and its wristband fitness tracker SmartBand Talk that takes phone calls. See also: 10 Fan-Made Apple Product Concepts We Wish Were Real [PICS] Although it was rumored that the SmartWatch 3 might not run on Android Wear, it is indeed powered by Google\\'s relatively new smartwatch platform, the company announced. Not only does the device let you take calls, check email and track your fitness activity, it can be controlled with your voice.  This means anything you\\'d ask Google\\'s intelligent personal assistant Google Now is fair game for the SmartWatch 3, from details about the weather, directions or making hotel reservations. Its arrival doesn\\'t come as a complete surprise. An image of the device popped up on Sony\\'s Facebook page in a promotion for its original Sony SmartBand, in what\\'s believed to be an accidental leak. The SmartWatch 3 — which will cost  229.99 euros but hasn\\'t received a price in the U.S. yet — comes with a 1.68-inch 320 x 320 display and is available in black. Users will be able to upgrade to a pink or white band for 24.99 EUR more. The design is somewhat different than the two previous iterations of Sony\\'s smartwatch and more closely resembles the first version of the Samsung Galaxy Gear and Samsung Gear 2 Neo. Features include an accelerometer, compass, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, Micro USB, 512 MB of RAM, an ambient light sensor and the ability to run for two days on one charge (four days if it\\'s used sparingly).  The company also unveiled the SmartBand Talk, the follow-up to its existing SmartBand fitness tracker, which launched earlier this year. The new one comes with a display — a curved E Ink display that\\'s always on — and it lets you field phone calls. It\\'s optimized for short talks (longer ones will drain the battery), a feature that\\'s still relatively rare among wristband fitness trackers.   While some trackers sync with smartphones and push notifications to the wristband, it\\'s unusual for one to actually allow you to pick up calls, but this one can — thanks to its built-in microphone and loudspeaker. It still, of course, tracks your steps, calories and sleep cycle, too. The new SmartBand runs on Android 4.4 \"KitKat.\" The price is 159 euros for the SmartBand Talk and an additional 24.99 euros for a two-pair wristband pack. Both products are a part of a larger effort by both Sony and other manufacturers to capitalize on wearable tech. According to research firm Canalys, annual smartwatch shipments alone are estimated to reach 8 million in 2014; that number is estimated to grow to more 23 million units by 2015 and more than 45 million by 2017.

       " \" When planning a vacation, our minds fill with images of sandy beaches and rain-drizzled, cobblestone European streets — not of the look on our miniature schnauzer’s face when he realizes the house is being burgled. See also: 10 Travel Tips for Protecting Your Privacy With more than two million homes burgled in the United States each year, it’s important to protect yourself from incursions — especially during times your house is left unattended. Below is a list of the top tips and tricks to ward off criminals, so that your travels go off without a hitch. 1. Monitor your house from afar It’s important to keep tabs on your home, even when traveling to the far reaches of the world. The easiest way to do so is by installing security cameras. Most modern cameras are equipped with night vision and motion sensors, and can be synced with your mobile device or tablet. The other way to check in on your house is to either ask a friend to do so or to program your computer’s built-in webcam to act as a security camera. There are several apps on the market that enable users to access their web camera from afar so that you won’t miss anything at your home. It's important to consider that simple surveillance may not be enough in the event of a break-in — it's one thing to watch your home being raided, and another to ensure that swift action is taken in a worst-case-scenario situation. There really is no comparison to installing a professional security system to keep an eye on your home. Watching the place yourself can be time-consuming — and can detract from your vacation. It also doesn't allow for quick reactions should you notice anything amiss. Consider a professional home monitoring system, and let the experts take care of any home security breaches in the event of an incident. 2. Make it look like you're at home An abandoned home makes for an obvious target, so do your best to make it look like someone is at home. There are several ways to keep up the facade: Have your mail stopped, keep up with the yard work and shovel the snow. Have a neighbor park their cars in your driveway. You can also ask someone to take your garbage bins out on collection day — no one needs to know that they're empty. Another obvious trick is to automate specific electronics in your home, such as programming your lights or a stereo to switch on a certain time. The flurry of activity will make your house looked lived in. A low-cost, energy efficient way of doing this is with a push light. Switch on the battery-powered light before you leave, and let it glow throughout the duration of your trip. Smart plugs also offer the ability to control your lamps remotely.  Image: Flickr, Pat Pilon3. Keep your travel on the down-low Of course, it’s okay to tell Mom when you’re leaving the country, but try not to broadcast it too widely. Many people share personal information on Twitter or Facebook or post travel photos on Instagram without realizing how many people can access it. Would you announce to a crowd of strangers that your home will be vacant over Christmas? Probably not. Avoid posting about upcoming travel on social media or other Internet sites — this is a clear signal that you won’t be around. Perhaps more importantly, avoid posting remotely when you’re out of the country. Most sites will tell viewers where you’re posting from, and can draw criminals to an empty home. Yes, these are extreme measures, but they'll be sure to keep your home safe and secure. 4. Pull the plug on electronics Leaving devices plugged in can make it simpler for intruders to get into your home. An active garage door, for example, can be activated easily by a universal remote. Also remember to unplug the GPS from any car left in airport parking — burglars have been known to hop and in and hit “Home.” Unplugging these devices will also help you save on electricity while you’re gone, so you may as well pull out the coffeemaker cord while you're at it. 5. Prepare for the worst No one wants their home to be burglarized, but it’s better to be prepared. Before leaving on your trip, check your insurance policies. Make sure everything is up to date and provides accurate protection. Ensure that your coverage extends to robberies, as opposed to just accidents like floods or fires. And don’t forget to take photos of your belongings — this documentation can save you headaches in case of crisis. The first thing your insurance company will ask for in the event of a robbery is evidence of what was damaged or stolen. You should also notify your local neighborhood watch of vacations lasting more than a weekend. That way they'll know to respond swiftly in case of a triggered alarm or unusual activity.

       " ' The Internet can be a cruel and unforgiving place. Think about it, there are trolls, phishers and con artists lurking around almost ever corner. Scams and hoaxes everywhere. On occasion, social media propels one of these scams to viral fame. Facebook, as the grandaddy of social media, is a particularly fertile breeding ground for misinformation. According to Facebook users, we\\'re going to have to pay for Facebook; Facebook is shutting down; we need to post a ridiculous legalese privacy notice on our timelines to protect our data; and Morgan Freeman is dead.   Nobody likes playing the fool, and it\\'s particularly embarrassing to be the victim of a social media hoax. In other words, the next time one of these scams pop up, you don\\'t want to be duped into endorsing it. While we realize Mashable readers are among the most savvy social media users on the web, consider sharing the following list of tips and reminders with your friends and family. If we all work together to identify and inhibit these fallacies, we can nurture a smarter and more useful Internet for ourselves and posterity.  1. Be Part of the Solution Now that social media has turned most of us into citizen journalists of sorts, we must assume the responsibilities of the trade. That means everyone who enjoys the benefits of sharing must also actively attempt to make the Internet a space for truth and accuracy. Misinformation is insidious, and it can be very harmful.  As Winston Churchill said: \"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.\"  In the early stages of the shooting at Sandy Hook, mistaken reports surfaced that the shooter was Ryan Lanza, the actual shooter\\'s brother. Immediately journalists, both pro and amateur, began sharing Ryan Lanza\\'s Facebook picture. Moments later, hate groups started springing up. Facebook is the new court of public opinion, and it had all but convicted an innocent man of a heinous crime. This situation obviously wasn\\'t a premeditated hoax, but it is the type of situation newly anointed citizen journalists need to handle responsibly. The first step is to take ownership of that substantial responsibility. 2. Scrutinize the Source Unless you witnessed something firsthand, you can never be absolutely sure that it happened (and research shows even eyewitness testimony can be dodgy). From playing the game \"Telephone\" as children, we all know that information gets warped and loses accuracy each time a story is told and retold. For these reasons, it\\'s always good to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism when considering stories you hear, from the remarkable to the banal.  That being said, we have been on Facebook long enough at this point to know how our friends act on social media. Everyone has a few friends who are social media rockstars. They share current and pertinent content on a daily basis. Everyone also has a few friends who are, to put it gently, more likely to share viral misinformation.  It\\'s not enough to scrutinize who told you the information; try to trace it back to the original source. Who originally reported the information and how did that person arrive at his conclusion?  Above, my friend and colleague Alex Fitzpatrick shares an important bit of information. Being a pro journalist, he also provides the source of the information. If only it was always this easy.  3. Cross-Check the Information Don\\'t absentmindedly hit the re-share button. If you have any doubt that something might not be true, it\\'s you\\'re responsibility to get to the bottom of it.  Start with a Google search. Has the information been reported by a reputable media organization? Odds are you\\'re not getting paid for your work on social media. It\\'s not your responsibility to get the story first; it\\'s your responsibility to get it right. SEE ALSO: Not a Hoax: Facebook Might Have to Give You Ten Bucks  Sometimes a bit of critical thinking is all it takes. When Facebook charlatan Nolan Daniels posted a fake picture of himself with the \"winning\" Powerball ticket, Gawker debunked him by pointing out that, if the ticket was real, the numbers would list from lowest to highest.  This instance brings up another tell-tale sign of spam — it tries to propagate itself. Usually there will be some trick, attempting to encourage people to share the content. In Daniels\\' scam, he offered $1 million to one lucky person who shared his photo. More than 500,000 Facebook users took the bait. SEE ALSO: Viral \\'Privacy Notice\\' on Facebook Is Fake  In another scam, many felt compelled to post a fake privacy notice on their timelines, hoping it would protect their Facebook data. The hoax was successful for two reasons. First, it touched on something most people are particularly cognizant of and concerned with: privacy in the age of social media. Secondly, the spam spread because, well, we\\'re not all expert lawyers.  To avoid falling for this type of hoax in the future, check one of the many news sites that covers social media. Those outlets will certainly have reporters assessing the veracity of any viral content. Or you could have just asked Boromir.   4. Share Your Findings With Others Not only should you avoid sharing misinformation; you should actively try to debunk it. If you\\'ve done your homework and found that a rumor is false, share it with your friends.   But be polite and discreet when proving people wrong. We have all made mistakes before — there\\'s really no need to be condescending or sanctimonious.  Discourage friends from sharing spam by posting a carefully worded status explaining how you know a piece of content isn\\'t true. Don\\'t single anyone out, and encourage others to pass along the message. If you notice a specific friend endorsing a potentially embarrassing sham, don\\'t correct the person via comment. Send a private message notifying him or her of the mistake. 5. Report to Facebook Posting lies is not necessarily against Facebook\\'s terms of service, which read: \"You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious or discriminatory.\" True, it does say the word \"misleading.\" But at the same time, Facebook has not removed the Morgan Freeman tribute page, which is certainly misleading.  In any event, if you see a hoax spreading, it can\\'t hurt to report it. If enough people do so, Facebook may take action — particularly if the misinformation is potentially harmful. To do so, click the downward arrow on the top-right corner of the Facebook post (the arrow is invisible until you roll over it) and select the appropriate action.  6. Work Together Social Media Journalism 101 is only a starting point from which we can begin to correct and prevent misinformation.

Fake Hurricane Sandy Pictures While everyone waited the arrival of Hurricane Sandy, social media users shared completely fake storm images, including this one, which combined a New York harbor photo with a 2004 picture, taken by photographer Mike Hollingshead.          2. The Future Isn\\'t Here Yet Remember that scene in Back To The Future, when Doc sets the DeLorean to an obscure future date? On June 27, 2012, a Photohopped image pitted that day as \"the future,\" and the rumor spread quickly on Facebook. Except that day day wasn\\'t \"the future\" -- the clock is actually set for Oct. 21, 2015.          3. #BaldforBieber In October, a hoax involving Justin Bieber encouraged fans to shave their heads to support the pop star, who -- according to the false rumor -- was recently diagnosed with cancer. A video posted to YouTube included fake, Photoshopped tweets from his account announcing the news and pictures of fans shaving their heads for support. #BaldforBieber also started to trend in the U.S.          4. Facebook Shutting Down A rumor that Facebook planned to shut down its site on March 15 made the rounds earlier this year, claiming CEO Mark Zuckerberg “wants his old life back” and desires to “put an end to all the madness.” A Facebook spokesperson later debunked the rumor, saying “the answer is no, so please help us put an end to this silliness.”           5. Morgan Freeman Death Rumors Social media occasionally circulates false celebrity death rumors, but the alleged news about actor Morgan Freedman\\'s passing in August took on a life of its own. His fake Facebook tribute pageraked in nearly 1 million Likes, and the rumors picked up again in October, when people on social networks shared their condolences.          6. Bieber Naked Photos  Justin Bieber was the subject of yet another hoax this year, and this time he was the one behind it.  To grow hype around his new song “Beauty and the Beat,” Justin Bieber tweeted that someone stole his laptop. However, the singer confronted someone claiming to be the thief on Twitter, who said they would release big news and a controversial video online the next day. It turned out to be a marketing ploy. But the news ushered in a wave of security concerns. Some cybercriminals set phishing traps and lure unsuspecting consumers to click on malicious links based around pop culture news, especially when leaked photos are involved. And this is precisely what happened.           7. Facebook Privacy Status Update In June, a fake \"Facebook Privacy Notice\" took the social network by storm, urging users to re-post a message that would allegedly protect their privacy. The concept was based around the faux notion that the company\\'s IPO would affect user privacy. Facebook members were quick to share the post, and before we knew it, the false claim had overtaken the site.          8. Fake Kidnapping  When a 16-year-old girl from New Jersey tweeted that someone was in her house and then mysteriously disappeared, Twitter users rallied around her message. Not only did #HelpFindKara trend worldwide on Twitter, nearly 34,000 people retweeted her call for help. But police discovered she actually faked her own kidnapping.  The news didn\\'t sit well with the Internet — many said they were \"disgusted\" with her tweet, which caused fear in so many people. Police later found her walking alongside a highway and returned her safely to family.        ',\n",
       " ' Peter G McDermott is a technology enthusiast and community builder dedicated to helping small businesses connect with their customers online. In November of 2013, I became a Google Glass Explorer. Part of this endeavor involved forking over $1,500 and tax for a technology device that was still in beta. The hardware was beyond prototype, but not in the mass production scale that would be necessary for worldwide distribution. Just a few years ago, smart watches such as those made by Sony and Pebble were very limited in their functionality, battery life and technical specifications. When Project Glass was announced in 2012, it was seen as a revolutionary technology. It was wearable computing to the next level. Google Glass enabled people to have the information they “needed” in the corner of their eye and gave them instant access to the world wide web with just a simple voice command. In theory, the technology is great. However, in practice, it’s a different story. I have been a Glass Explorer for just shy of six months and I have to admit that I (like many other Glass Explorers) use the technology much less than I ever thought I would and here’s why: Battery Life: Most of the applications for Google Glass can be a battery hog. However, with “regular” use throughout the day, I can usually squeeze a good 6-8 hours of casual use before the battery is depleted. Many of the augmented reality applications such as  World Lens, require a lot of battery use because they involve the use of the camera, display, wireless data and heavy processor use. Doing something as simple as taking a video can deplete the device’s battery in just 20-30 minutes. Granted, Glass isn’t designed or intended to record long form content, but more or less “moments” which is why the device records 10 second video clips by default. Security “Issues”: Many workplaces will not allow the use of Google Glass because of exposure to sensitive information and PII (Personally Identifiable Information). I would not be surprised to see if the PCI standards change to ban the use of wearable cameras in areas where employees are able to see credit card numbers. Sadly, most of the concerns about Glass are around it’s camera, which brings me to my next point. Social Acceptance: Wearing a computer on your face is about as acceptable as riding a Segway around your office. The simple truth is that we aren’t there yet. The fact that we recently learned about the largest government surveillance scandal in recorded history doesn’t help either. People feel that their privacy has been invaded enough by companies reading their e-mail, governments listening to their phone calls and more surveillance cameras than we realize. Until these fears are settled, wearing around a camera on your face will remain a faux pas in many settings. Reliability: Google Glass is not reliable. Plain and simple. Switching between Bluetooth and Wifi data is never seamless. The device is incapable of connecting to Wifi networks that require TOS agreements or have any sort of splash page login method. If you leave the device turned off and unplugged for a period of time, the battery mysteriously depletes itself. The most frustrating reliability issue is related to connectivity. You can have Google Glass successfully paired to an LTE device with great signal strength and still see the dreaded “can’t reach Google right now” message. Image: Peter G. McDermott  Moto 360 Won’t Have These Problems The most exciting thing about the Moto 360 is that it won’t have most of the problems that I encounter on a daily basis with Google Glass. First of all, it’s on my wrist, so it’s much less conspicuous than a face-mounted computer. This definitely helps us in the social acceptance arena, and makes it a wearable that I’m comfortable wearing everywhere (except maybe not the shower). Battery life may be a problem, but not in a way that it is for Glass. I expect overnight charging for my smart watch and would love to see wireless Qi charging integration to make that process just a little bit easier. Better App Development I don’t think I’m alone in assuming that there will be more and better apps designed for wrist-mounted wearables. Although the Android Wear platform may look completely analogous to Glassware, it’s a much more practical form factor which means more users and more potential for success of any certain app. Also, apps can be designed to work on a number of devices, not just Motorola’s upcoming offering. Developing for a multi-device platform is a no-brainer when compared to developing for a single device on a different framework. Sex Appeal Men love watches. It’s really the only jewelry that most guys wear, and a lot can be inferred by the watch someone wears. For example, during the work week, I wear a Seiko stainless steel watch with a black face and very minimalist design. It shows that I am polished, responsible and punctual. On the weekends I like to wear a leather-banded “easy read” by Timex that is reminiscent of a standard GI watch from decades before. With the ability to instantly change the face of your watch and select a stylish band, this wearable becomes less of a computer and more of an accessory. Safety With Moto 360, you don’t have to brag to the world that you’re wearing a computer. A fringe benefit of this design is safety, as we recently learned from the woman wearing Google Glass that was allegedly mugged inside of a San Francisco bar. Affordability & Luxury $1,500 was a lot of money to thrown down on a prototype. Especially something that won’t get daily wear. I don’t expect that Google Glass will dip below $800 any time soon, either. Moto 360, on the other hand, is likely to come to the market with a sub-$500 price tag. The competition in the market will surely help keep prices down as other manufacturers continue to innovate. However, as in the world of watches, history tells us that consumers will spend thousands of dollars for a rare timepiece. If any of the major watch makers join the game, we might see an emergency of luxury smart watches which will only drive more consumers in the middle class to pick up a lower priced model. I wanted Glass when it was announced. It was new, it was fresh and it was unexplored territory in the real world. Now that I’ve seen Moto 360, I see elements some elements of Glass that I love that will fit much better into my daily life.  ',\n",

Or if you want your eyewear to suggest meals based on the contents of your fridge?  Tech company Atheer is launching a Google Glass competitor that let you touch the digital world, shifting from passive viewing to an immersive \"doing\" and interacting — the ultimate vision of augmented reality. The company launched an Indiegogo campaign on Thursday as a part of an effort to bring more developers into the development process. SEE ALSO: 7 Reasons 2013 Was the Year of Google  Atheer\\'s video suggested the potential in a future of wearable technology and 3D smart glasses. Watch it above; we dare you not to get excited. \"The experiences shown in the video from the user’s point of view can be available in 1-2 years,\" Atheer CEO Soulaiman Itani told Mashable. \"Every functionality shown has been prototyped in a minimalistic way, but more with the core technology. Minimizing the hardware to be as small as in the video will probably take closer to eight years.\"  But other steps must come first, Itani said. Batteries must get smaller and more powerful, processes must speed up and the public must grow more comfortable with wearable technology. \"Consumers today are very smart, and very quick to adopt technology that improves their lives, but Rome wasn’t built in a day,\" he said. \"People need time to experience Atheer, understand what an immersive computing experience really means, and understand that the benefits of the technology outweigh the costs of adoption and integration into their daily lives.\" Atheer also needs developers to build more immersive apps like the ones seen in the video.  \"Our team is building some apps, but like any great platform, the robustness of the ecosystem will come once we get our technology and our SDK in the hand of third party developers.\" Backers of the campaign can receive the Atheer Developer Kit ($850), which comes with access to the developer portal including design guidelines, documentation, samples, support and bug tracking and reporting.  \"Between now and when the hardware is ready to ship, developers can dream up ideas, build and test them in an emulated environment,\" Itani said. \"By the time they’re ready to test on hardware, they’ll have the hardware development kit in their hands.\" Donating $350 to the Atheer campaign will get you a pair of the glasses when they\\'re ready.

       " ' Facebook video ads are coming to your News Feed — it\\'s just a matter of when. AdAge reported in mid-December that Facebook was planning to introduce a new ad product \"by April at the latest\" that would let marketers target video ads in users\\' News Feeds on desktop and mobile devices.  According to that report, the ads would max out at 15 seconds and start playing automatically in the feed.  Rory Maher, an analyst with Hillside Partners, said last month that Facebook was \"beta testing a video ad product,\" which could be released in the first half of this year. And Facebook\\'s top ad exec David Fischer confirmed in a recent interview that the company was \"certainly looking\" at the option of introducing video ad units.  Facebook took a big step this week toward paving the way for video ads with the redesign of News Feed. The overhauled look places much more emphasis on visual content. Marketers we spoke with believe it will give them more room to create richer and larger ad units, including videos.  If your first reaction to the idea of seeing video ads appear in your News Feed is to start typing another F-word besides Facebook, you\\'re probably not alone.  \"Facebook knows that they can\\'t alienate users and continue to grow at the rate they are. That\\'s why we\\'ve seen them be cautious in rolling out monetization products,\" said Clark Fredricksen, an analyst with eMarketer. \"It\\'s my guess that we\\'ll see something similar here.\" So can Facebook place video ads in News Feed without angering or alienating its users? The short answer is that Facebook does some version of this already. Brands and marketers have the option to post videos to the social network, which they can pay to promote as an ad. These are not preroll ads or auto-playing ads, or even the kind of pop-out ads you see on other websites — but they are video ads nonetheless. Some advertising companies like Moontoast — one of Facebook\\'s preferred marketing developers — are now helping brands improve the video experience by building more interactive video units for Sponsored Stories. With Moontoast\\'s platform, the user can click to play and expand the video, share it with friends and make purchases through it without having to leave the page. Marcus Whitney, co-founder and CTO of Moontoast, says brands have found great success with these kind of video spots. \"Video is extremely engaging,\" he told Mashable. \"It\\'s been one of our most effective rich-media ads that we\\'ve delivered so far.\"  Most marketers we spoke with believe Facebook video ads will continue to head in this direction. Dave Williams, founder and CEO of Blinq Media, says he\\'s heard that Facebook\\'s sales team is looking to bring on more companies to produce these kind of interactive ad units. Of course, this isn\\'t the only video ad product we\\'ll see on Facebook. AdWeek reported on Thursday that Facebook now has a team of 150 employees working to build video tools for users and businesses that might make it easier for media companies to deliver more videos on the site and perhaps even place preroll ads in these clips. In this sense, Facebook would be following the YouTube model for video ad delivery. There are limits to what users can and will accept on Facebook, however, and the company seems to be aware of it. Fischer, the Facebook VP, said as much in an interview at a media conference last month. \"What we want to figure out is the intersection of what users will love and what marketers could love,\" he said. \"I think what we\\'re unlikely to do is ... those kinds of what we in the business call home-page takeovers, that kind of thing.\" However, the belief among marketers is that Facebook users may be able to tolerate various types of video promotions more now, thanks to the redesign. \"It will scroll nicely and it will be a little less intrusive,\" said Dan Slagen, SVP of marketing at Nanigans, of how video ads will look in the new News Feed.  More than that, Slagen says the extra subfeed categories that Facebook added will help with video ad delivery by giving users a little more control over when and which videos they might see. For example, users can basically opt in to seeing videos on brand pages by going to their Following feed, or they might see a promotional video for a video game when in the Gaming feed, which is presumably more relevant to them at that time. Even before the new News Feed rolled out, Facebook\\'s CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg suggested in an earnings call that placing greater emphasis on user-created videos and pictures on the homepage would lead to marketers having more freedom to place the kind of rich media ads they\\'ve always wanted to on the social network: Advertisers want really rich things like big pictures or videos, and we haven’t provided those things historically. But one of the things that we’ve done in the last year, as you’ve seen, the organic News Feed product that consumers use are moving towards bigger pictures, richer media, and I think you will continue to see it go in that direction... So I think you see the trend there in terms of where it’s going and that’s just naturally going to make it, so we can deliver much more engaging advertising experiences than we were traditionally able to do and when we didn’t have those types of content in the system. Translation: Show off user videos more prominently in the News Feed and the occasional video ad won\\'t seem quite so intrusive. There\\'s even a chance that showing good video ads could boost engagement on the site, rather than hurt it. \"Whether it\\'s user video or brand supported, video is a highly engaging medium and it has the potential to grow engagement significantly on Facebook,\" Fredricksen from eMarketer says. \"As it so happens, it can help them grow their ad revenue substantially as well.\" Do you think placing video ads in News Feed would worsen the experience of using Facebook?

       " \" True story: On Monday, in the midst of the morning scramble to get ready for work, I was all set to go, when I couldn't find my car keys. Ten minutes of frantic searching later, I found them in a jar where I keep my pencils and pens. We've all lost things in weird places at inopportune times, and a new product, Tile, could help ease that frustration. Tiles are matchbook-sized, Bluetooth-enabled low energy devices that track your belongings. Just stick the white Tile to your laptop (using the included double-sided adhesive), attach to keys or drop into your purse/wallet and you can find those things using the Tile iOS app. You can add up to 10 Tiles on a single account. Log into the app on your own or your friend's iPhone/iPad and pinpoint the Tile's location within an advertised range of 50 to 150 feet. SEE ALSO: 8 Excellent Bike Mounts to Hold Your iPhone  Similar to Apple's Find My iPhone app, you can also ring your Tile to help you find it audibly, since it has a built-in speaker.  It's a simple concept that's even more useful with Tile's crowdsourced approach for finding lost items out of range. When something is lost and you're out of the 50 to 150 feet range, you can let Tile's community network know: Other users with Tile apps within 50 to 150 feet of your Tile can automatically detect your lost item and you'll get notified of the location. The key here though is that there has to be a sizeable community of Tile users roaming about for this to be effective. You can also share your Tiles with family, friends, roommates or anyone else and grant them access to an item's location (a shared pair of keys or a remote control, for instance).  Right now, Tile only works with iOS devices supporting Bluetooth 4.0: the iPhone 5 and 4S, the iPad Mini, iPad 3rd and 4th generation, and iPod Touch 5th generation. Tile is not being developed for Android at this time, since it doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0. Both a pro and con of the device is that the it doesn't require battery replacement. While it's certainly handy that you don't need to regularly charge your Tiles, the company says each Tile will only last for one year after activation and you'll be reminded to order a new one at that time. But Tile will send you an envelope to recycle your old Tiles.  Tile was created by software and hardware engineers Mike Farley and Nick Evans. They built the product out of Tandem Capital, a mobile-focused accelerator in Burlingame, Calif. Its basic premise is not necessarily new, there are competitors: The hipKey and StickNFind stickers are similar trackers. For a limited time, you can pre-order a Tile for $18.95 online. They're expected to ship in winter 2013/2014 in the United States and Canada. Beginning Thursday, Tile will also accept orders for international shipping to Australia, New Zealand and countries in the European Union. In its self-started fundraising campaign to fund the first manufacturing and production run, the company had raised more than $53,200, as of Tuesday evening. Would you find a tracker device like Tile useful in your daily life? Or is a gadget for your gadgets too much? Let us know in the comments. Thumbnail and images courtesy of Tile \",\n",

       " \" Being the U.S. president means almost never having to say you’re sorry about a war. Harry Truman didn’t apologize for dropping atomic bombs on Japan. No president said he was sorry to Vietnam’s government. The same is true for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The issue flared anew after the New York Times reported that Afghan officials said they would require an expression of contrition from President Barack Obama for military mistakes, including causing civilian casualties, in exchange for an agreement over how long U.S. troops could stay in their country. Secretary of State John Kerry said Afghan President Hamid Karzai hadn’t asked for an apology and none would be given. An apology, Kerry said yesterday, “wasn’t even on the table.” Because a president’s words carry the weight of history, an apology is no simple matter. Such an admission has the potential to undermine the sacrifice of troops and could potentially subject the country to liability for reparations. “There’s a common misperception out there that apologies are somehow simple gestures, and there just couldn’t be anything further from the truth,” said Jennifer Lind, author of Sorry States: Apologies in International Politics.  She added, “Apologies from one country to another are extremely fraught and, for that reason, historically, are extremely rare.” Differences in law and culture help “explain why apologies are a much bigger deal than you would think,” said Lind, a professor of government at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Twitter Power The debate is magnified by the power of social media. Whatever Obama does “there’s going to be a whole crew of people unhappy about it,” Lind said, noting angry posts on Twitter denouncing the president as “the apologizer in chief.” Karzai has often demanded apologies from the U.S. for civilian deaths, even as more Afghanis have died at the hands of militants than American troops. “There’s a broader sense that getting the Americans to actually admit guilt and literally use the word ‘sorry’ does have a certain political value, in Afghanistan and Pakistan and other countries,” said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow for South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, a policy group in Washington. A letter from Obama released Thursday didn’t apologize or express regret. The closest it came was a comment that the U.S. would “redouble our efforts to ensure that Afghan homes are respected by our forces and that our operations are conducted consistent with your law.” Admitting Wrong “Saying sorry has no cost if that’s all that’s required; it’s easy,” said Graham Dodds, a political science professor at Concordia University in Montreal who has studied official apologies. “But a politician is generally reluctant to do it because it means admitting wrong.” Presidents have apologized for specific atrocities committed by soldiers. Obama expressed “deep regret” over American troops burning Korans, just as President George W. Bush apologized to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for a U.S. soldier shooting a Muslim holy book as part of sniper practice. In 1968, the U.S. admitted in a signed apology to North Korea that the U.S.S. Pueblo had violated territorial waters. In exchange, the captured crew was released. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan expressed regret over the U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger jet over the Persian Gulf that killed all 290 aboard. Yet, even years after the fact, presidents don’t tend to say they’re sorry. In April 1995, President Bill Clinton said “the United States owes no apology to Japan for having dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.” Delegating Apologies Sometimes presidents leave it to Cabinet officers. On July 4, 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement to defuse a feud with Pakistan, saying “we are sorry” about a U.S. military strike that mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops. After that, a military supply route was reopened. Those officials also can be deployed to deliver a non-apology, as Colin Powell did on April 4, 2001, when he refused to tell China the U.S. was sorry for a collision between a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet. “There is nothing to apologize for,” Powell said. Republicans have accused Obama of apologizing too much for U.S. actions. Mitt Romney, the president’s challenger in 2012, said the incumbent had gone on an “apology tour” by going to “various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.” Cairo Speech Obama’s first trip abroad as president included a speech in Cairo in which he tried to reset relations with the Muslim world. He didn’t apologize for the war in Iraq, as Romney suggested. Rather, he called the 2003 U.S. invasion a “war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.” Dodds said contrition comes mainly as an official statement from a government or a diplomatic statement intended to gain a result. The U.S. government and several presidents have apologized for the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, he said. On Feb. 19, 1976, President Gerald Ford said the internment was “wrong,” a sentiment echoed by Reagan and Clinton. Other countries are “much less reticent” to issue an apology, Dodds said. “This is sort of a case of American exceptionalism.” And it all comes down to context. “There’s no red line or glass ceiling when it comes to apologies,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center, a Washington policy group. “The issue is context.” Image: Dennis Brack-Pool/Getty images  Is an OPEC Deal Still Someways Off?

SEE ALSO: Empathy Towards Robots Could Impact Battlezones  The Helmet Electronics and Display System-Upgradeable Protection — better known as HEaDS-UP — may look like battle gear for fictional interstellar warfare, but the helmet goes way beyond fun and games. Developed by ballistic eyewear company Revision, the modular HEaDS-UP system is composed of a standard Army helmet with expanded features that protect the head, neck and face. The add-ons include a see-through ballistic visor and a mandible face mask that protects against 9-mm ammunition and offers better eye, face and hearing protection than existing helmets. Most notable are the display technologies that can be projected on the inside of the visor. Though there aren’t any specifics on the projected displays yet, it’s safe to assume there could be images of battlefield maps, targets, health monitors, communications and other Google Glass-type tech. At a recent demonstration for the Army, the HEaDS-UP helmet featured integrated electronics, a display powered by an Android smartphone, plus a liner system that met new 14-feet-per-second impact requirements to reduce traumatic brain injuries. SEE ALSO: Radiation-Proof Underwear Protects The Goods  HEaDS-UP is the culmination of a four-year research project from the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center. ”You traditionally had helmets where people velcro-ed duct-taped on components,” Brian Dowling, Revision’s Military Program Manager and Army special operations veteran, told Kit Up! “The HEaDS-UP program has really taken head protection to the next step for Natick.” Image: Flickr, Eric Havir    This article originally published at Discovery News here  ',\n",
       " ' The U.S. secretly built a Twitter-like service with the aim of stirring political unrest in Cuba, a report by the Associated Press claims. The \"Cuban Twitter\" project, called \"ZunZuneo,\" was publicly launched in 2010; it lasted more than two years, and had tens of thousands of subscribers. The plan was to circumvent Cuba\\'s internet filters, build a young audience and then turn them into dissenters, but the question that now arises is: was the scheme legal? See also: Obama Shakes Hands With Cuba\\'s Raul Castro at Mandela\\'s Memorial The AP obtained a 2010 memo from a company called Mobile Accord Inc., which was one of the project\\'s creators.   \"There will be absolutely no mention of United States government involvement. This is absolutely crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the success of the Mission,\" the memo said.   An archived screenshot of ZunZuneo, a Cuban Twitter-like service which lasted from 2010 to 2012. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. was behind the project, aiming to stir unrest in Cuba. Image:  Wayback MachineThe project, which included a companion website and a marketing campaign, cost an estimated $1.6 million; publicly, though, the money was meant to be spent for an unspecified project in Pakistan. ZunZuneo disappeared abruptly in 2012.  To hide the money trail, the company was set up in Spain, with the money flowing from the Cayman Islands, a British offshore tax haven.  According to the AP, officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would not say who approved the project or whether the Obama administration was aware of it. The United States\\' relations with Cuba have improved since Raúl Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as president. Notably, in December 2013, President Barack Obama shook hands with Castro at Nelson Mandela\\'s funeral in Johannesburg, South Africa — the first formal greeting between American and Cuban leaders since 2000. The ZunZuneo project, however, sounds like a remnant from the Cold War.  ',\n",

       " ' As goes pornography, so goes the tech industry. When the porn business embraced VHS over Betamax and Blu-ray over HD DVD, videophiles of all tastes followed their lead. The next big innovation might be Google Glass, a pair of Internet-connected glasses that takes photos, records video and offers hands-free Internet access right in front of users\\' eyes. Once Glass launches, the porn industry intends to take full advantage of this new technology, say two insiders. \"The way that this will change porn is pretty ridiculous,\" said Alana Evans, a porn actress and radio host of \"The Naughty Gamers Show\" on Sirius XM. \"It\\'s going to cause a huge drive in POV- (point of view) style production.\" These videos make the viewer feel like part of the action by filming from a first-person perspective. Missy Martinez, porn actress and co-host of Evans\\' show, agrees. \"It might be easier to film POV gonzo-style movies,\" explained Martinez, referring to a newer, more experimental style of porn production. Filming POV porn can be very difficult, as a performer has to mount an unwieldy camera on his or her shoulder while doing other things that generally require a person\\'s full attention. By contrast, \"[Glass is] essentially hands-free,\" said Martinez. She believes that the device may even capture video with enough fidelity to replace the traditional bulky cameras. \"Glass has some high-res capabilities, and could possibly do away with handheld POV altogether.\"  SEE ALSO: 5 Unsettling Uses of Google Glasses Camera  Porn producers may also take advantage of Glass by filming female POV movies, which, at present, barely constitute a genre at all. Martinez envisions a new world of possibilities, especially when it comes to lesbian productions. \"I think it\\'s a really untapped market,\" she said. Martinez explained that it\\'s difficult to film woman-on-woman POV scenes with existing technology, because there are places that a cumbersome camera can\\'t go. Glass could offer some exciting new opportunities for viewers. \"I was a big \\'Choose Your Own Adventure\\' fan when I was a kid,\" said Evans, who envisions the same kind of interactivity in Glass pornography. Thanks to DVD menus and discrete chapters, this kind of production already exists, but not in a truly immersive way. \"It\\'s one thing to stare at your TV and make a choice, but to have a headset on and think you\\'re inside the scene? It\\'s going to change [porn\\'s] direction.\" Both Evans and Martinez also recommend connecting Glass with an existing technology called RealTouch. The RealTouch is a male sex toy that connects to the Internet and takes verisimilitude in porn to a very physical level. This device syncs with certain films and responds to actions on-screen to allow a viewer to experience the same sensations as a performer. \"It\\'d be absolutely crazy not to use it,\" said Martinez. \"What you\\'re seeing is what you\\'re feeling. I hope the technology is there. What are we doing with our scientists right now?\" Google Glass could change fashion, too. With performers bespectacled at all times, a whole new generation of viewers could develop a serious glasses fetish. No more will the sexy librarian throw her hair back and tear off her glasses. Maybe now she\\'ll put on a pair instead. Image via VALERY HACHE/AFP/GettyImages    This article originally published at TechNewsDaily here  ',\n",
       " ' The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has the technical capacity to crack the most commonly-used cellphone encryption technology, and in doing so it can decode and access the content of calls and text messages, according to a Washington Post report published Friday. Citing a top-secret document leaked by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, the report states that the agency can easily break a technology called A5/1, the world\\'s most common stream cipher used to encrypt cellular data as it transmits to cell towers. See also: Will Obama Rein in NSA Surveillance Powers? Privacy and security researcher Ashkan Soltani, co-author the Post\\'s report, explains that encryption experts have long been aware of the weakness of A5/1. The technology makes use of decades-old 2G GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) cellular network technology.  The so-called \"summer of revelations\" on NSA surveillance tactics, fueled by Snowden\\'s leaked documents, has brought to light the agency\\'s vast data-collecting capabilities. The NSA\\'s considerable abilities to collect and decode cellular data would seem to allow it to track private conversations on a very wide scale. Of course, it would be against the law for the NSA to use these capabilities to spy on Americans without a court order. But experts believe other nations have probably developed many of these same surveillance technologies. Here\\'s how the NSA responded to the Post\\'s inquiry about the topic: Throughout history nations have used encryption to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cyber criminals, human traffickers and others also use technology to hide their activities. The Intelligence Community tries to counter that in order to understand the intent of foreign adversaries and prevent them from bringing harm to Americans and allies. NSA phone spying got the NSA in a bit of diplomatic hot water in October, when reports surfaced that the agency may have spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s conversations.  Global cell service providers have been slow to update their networks because it would be an \"expensive, time-consuming undertaking that likely would cause interruptions in service for some customers,\" according to the Post, though this is less true in the U.S. and \"the wealthiest nations.\"  The top-secret document does not indicate whether or not the NSA can infiltrate newer 3G and 4G GSM networks, nor does it say if the agency can break another cellular encryption technology called Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA, which  Verizon, Sprint and some foreign companies use, according to the Post. AT&T, the largest GSM provider in the U.S., is in the process of upgrading its networks to what\\'s called A5/3 encryption, the Post reports, which requires 100,000 times more computing power to break compared to A5/1. T-Mobile told the Post that it is \"continuously implementing advanced security technologies in accordance with worldwide recognized and trusted standards,\" but the company did not go into specifics.

       " \" And so we inch closer to the end — and a new World Cup champion.  But, first, we still have the quarterfinals to get through — in which, for the first time ever, all eight group winners made it through the round of 16.  Friday marks the beginning of the quarterfinals in which South America and Europe will each have to eliminate one of their own. See also: World Cup Quarterfinals: How to Pick a New Favorite Team After the round of 16, four European teams, three South American teams and one Central American team remain. When Friday is through, the Europeans and South Americans will each lose one more when Germany plays France, and Brazil plays Colombia. Two European and two South American powerhouses ruthlessly enter the quarterfinals; only one from each continent will continue their country's quest for glory. Who will survive? France vs. Germany, 12 p.m. ET Out of all 32 teams in the tournament, France had the undeniably best showing in the group stage — winning all three matches with an especially convincing 5-2 win over Switzerland — leaving many French fans wondering what could've happened had they not imploded due to coaching problems in 2010. Still, throughout the group stages and leading up to the round of 16, people continued to ignore the French as long-shots to win the tournament. Instead, old favorites like Brazil and the Netherlands, and the CONCACAF underdogs Costa Rica, the U.S. and Mexico earned much of the spotlight.  France's Paul Pogba (19) celebrates after scoring France's opening goal during the World Cup round of 16 soccer match between France and Nigeria at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia, Brazil on June 30, 2014.Image: David Vincent/Associated PressMaybe that was right. Despite beating Nigeria 2-0 in their round of 16 match on Monday, the French had one of their weakest showings of the tournament. It was a much closer match than many had anticipated, considering France's decimation in Group E. But the same could be said of the Germans. Looking at their group stage run, Germany started the tournament flexing their muscle in a 4-0 win over Portugal. Then things sort of deflated for the Germans. A 2-2 draw with Ghana tested the Germans and revealed just how vastly inferior their defense (despite having a world class right back in Phillip Lahm, who head coach Joachim Low plays in the midfield instead) is compared to an offensive lineup boasting world class players. In their last group match against the U.S., the rains of Recife slowed down the German's typically splendid and creative attacks, and they were ultimately only able to put one goal in. Up until this quarterfinal match, the teams that faced both Germany and France tried to stop them from playing their game. Don't expect that to happen when the titans clash because both teams have exceptional talent that would be wasted otherwise. Paul Pogba, Karim Benzema and Antoine Griezmann won't want to sit back and try to dismantle the German attack led by the likes of Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil and maybe even Andre Schurrle after his invigorating presence in Germany's nerve-wracking Algeria match on Monday.  Germany-France will be an explosive match — maybe not the most high-scoring, but certainly full of creative and inventive play. If the group stages are about holding on for the best possible outcome to mathematically edge out others to enter the knockout round, and the round of 16 is about playing to avoid losing in the first half, the quarterfinals and every round moving forward is about striking fear into the hearts of the countries that remain.  And both Germany and France can do that. Brazil vs. Colombia, 4 p.m. ET Brazil has long been the king of South America when it comes to soccer. There's no other way around that. With five World Cup wins — the most of any nation in the world — they are the kings of the Cup. But maybe it's time for a new monarch? Brazil's World Cup run has been full of struggles. They struggled in their opening match against Croatia, but eventually managed to win (maybe aided by some questionable calls, or lack thereof, from the center referee). They definitely struggled against a steely Mexico, where, despite the 0-0 draw, Mexico and their goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa came out looking like the real winners.  In Brazil's round of 16 match against Chile on Saturday, the kings looked shaky again — not only in regulation time, not only in extra time, but also in penalty kicks. If Chile's Mauricio Pinilla's agonizingly close shot in the last minute of extra time had been just a hair lower, Brazil would've been out of the tournament and an entire nation would have been left shattered.  When you look at Colombia's World Cup, it's a whole different picture summarized entirely by the 22-year-old James Rodriguez. Colombia's play has been quick, spirited and youthful — a style that made quick work of their group and Luis Suarez-less Uruguay. Colombia eased through the tournament thus far, probably spending more energy shaking those hips in their post-goal celebrations. Colombia's run through the World Cup in some ways could be compared to France's. Sometimes its better to test your nerves in the group stages in hard-fought matches. Problems become much clearer in the face of adversity. Maybe Brazil, and even Germany, have tested their mettle and mustered to find wins in the overwhelming pressure of do-or-die matches. Or, just as likely, Colombia's current performance has actually been that flawless. We'll see either way on Friday when we witness the continued reign of Brazil's battle-scarred kings or the abdication of a worn throne.

       " \"     After a swift and bloody push, radical fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant are now less than 40 miles from Baghdad, where scared residents have begun stockpiling gasoline, water and food in preparation for what they fear could be cataclysmic violence. See also: Iraq Implodes: What You Need to Know How serious are these developments for the future of the Middle East? Here are five worst-case — but not unlikely — scenarios: The central government falls as the capital explodes in a sectarian bloodbath Baghdad is a patchwork of sectarian and mixed neighborhoods, and weapons proliferate. Shiite militias — some supported by Iran — are already arming and organizing in places including Sadr City, the vast Shiite slum on the outskirts of Baghdad.  There were reports on Tuesday that four Sunni men had been shot to death in a Shiite area of the capital, bringing back grim memories and raising the specter of sectarian war. Whether more moderate Sunnis, who have long felt persecuted by the Shiite government led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, will join the radical fighters of ISIS is one development to keep an eye on. Terrorists secure a foothold in the heart of the Middle East  This undated file image posted on a militant website shows fighters from the al-Qaida linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) marching in Raqqa, Syria.Image: Militant Website, File/Associated PressThe militants from the group known as ISIS or ISIL have have already taken several cities, including Mosul, Tikrit, Fallouja and Tal Afar, consolidating control over large swaths of territory in western and northern parts of the country. They may not be able to hold the entire country, but the militants have already established a de facto Sunni Islamic caliphate in the territories they have captured, enforcing Sharia law and threatening public executions and other brutal reprisals.  The solidification of an extremist enclave brings to mind Taliban rule in Afghanistan before 9/11 and could be a significant strategic and security defeat for the U.S. as such an extremist sanctuary could provide training grounds for international terrorists.  The end of Iraq  Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Iraqi special forces deploy their troops outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, Iraq on June 12, 2014.Image: Feriq Ferec/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesIraqi and American officials have long disavowed the disintegration of the country. But if Baghdad falls, or becomes a battlefield between the sects, the country could split into three (mutually hostile) regions with the Kurds seceding in the north; the Shiites retrenching in the south and the Sunnis consolidating their hold on the west. That could further destabilize the region and send people fleeing for neighboring countries. If Iraq falls apart, oil production could be affected and prices could rise dramatically with possibly severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy.  The worst refugee crisis since World War II  Iraqis who have fled the violence in their hometown of Mosul line arrive at Khazir refugee camp outside of Irbil, 217 miles  north of Baghdad, Iraq, Monday, June 16, 2014Image: AP Photo/Associated PressThe United Nations estimates that at least half a million Iraqis have already fled Mosul and an additional 430,000 have been displaced by fighting in the Western province of Anbar. Further fighting could spur the exodus of millions more, adding to the Syrian refugee crisis next door, which has already pushed neighboring countries including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to the brink.  Religious war engulfs the region Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan enter the conflict on different sides. While these countries already operate proxies in Iraq, more direct involvement could transform this into a catastrophic region-wide war between Sunnis and Shiites that would reverberate beyond the Middle East. “We are almost certainly witnessing the start of a global holy war between Sunnis and Shiites — the likes of which the world hasn't seen since the Great Schism in Europe, when millions of Protestants and Catholics slaughtered each other for centuries, bleeding Europe of a third of its population, fracturing nations, and plunging it into the Dark Ages,” wrote Ali Khedery, an adviser to several U.S. ambassadors to Iraq on the Best Defense blog.  \",\n",
       " ' A Korean baseball team that\\'s down on its luck has found a new way to fill seats at games: robot fans. The Hanwha Eagles recently unveiled robot proxies called \"fanbots,\" which enable fans to watch and cheer at games remotely.  See also: 13 Robots Who Don\\'t Know How to Robot Based in the city of Daejeon, the Eagles have lost more than 400 games in the last five years, according to the BBC, but persistent fans have earned the nickname \"Stone Buddhas\" for their steadfast commitment to the team. The Eagles wanted to find a way to harness their considerable online support, and translate it into real-life games by filling more stadium seats. \"[Fans] who cannot come to the stadium watch the game on the web or on their phones, and cheer through commenting online and via sns,\" the promotional YouTube video says. \"What if there was a robot cheering for those fans?\" To bridge that gap, the team created robots that can be controlled by fans at home. The \"world\\'s first cheering robots\" fill three rows of the stadium, and wear Eagles baseball caps and jerseys.  The machines are programmed to do the wave, cheer and chant. The bots also hold up LED screens with messages such as \"Go Eagles!\" or \"I Love You, Eagles.\" Fans can also send custom messages to be displayed on the screens during the game. They can even upload selfies, so their photos appear as the fanbot\\'s face. The robots even encourage real-life fans in the stadium to cheer \"at important moments\" in the game, according to the YouTube video. \"I like the fact that I can send messages even when I am not in the ballpark or not watch the game on TV.\" Kim Seung-bi, a 26-year-old Eagles fan said, according to the Korea Bizwire. \"I am proud of being an Eagles fan, as the club has pioneered the world’s first all-digital cheerleading troops.\"  Learn more about the fanbots in a video produced by the Hanwha Eagles, here:  ',\n",

       " \" On the spectrum of currency ideologues, gold bugs and Bitcoin enthusiasts occupy equal but opposite positions. They’re both suspicious that governments are going to meddle around with normal money so much that it becomes useless — it’s just that one group thinks math is the antidote and the other believes in hoarding metal bars. This week has seen the emergence of two separate plans to have the best of both worlds. Ripple, a digital payments network that allows people to transact in a range of virtual and traditional currencies, said it had developed a way for people to transact in a digital form of gold. The announcement on Tuesday came one day after a company called Anthem Vault said it had created its own virtual currency backed by gold, known (inevitably) as Independence Coin. Anthem Hayek Blanchard, who runs Anthem Vault, believes the time has come to convince believers in the gold standard that Bitcoin is more than a Ponzi scheme. Finally the two armies can join forces! “We don’t need to fight. We can coalesce,” he told Bloomberg News. Ripple, on the other hand, hasn’t actually created a new currency. Instead, it has reached a deal with GBI, a precious metals provider, to allow people to buy gold that will sit in GBI’s vaults for an annual fee of 0.5% of the value of the holdings. That stash can be used as the basis for transactions on Ripple, so that one side of the transaction spends gold and the other side receives Bitcoins or another form of payment. The caveat is that both parties in the transaction have to be willing and able to use Ripple’s payments protocol. If anyone gets spooked, he can simply call GBI and it will provide him with the actual gold that has been backing his digital transactions. These ideas couldn’t have come at a better time. Bitcoin has been losing its luster as the basis of a weird social movement and speculative tool as the financial grown-ups get hold of it and the conversation turns to transaction prices and capital controls. Bringing the gold bugs into the party creates at least some potential for fun. “You could live your whole life in gold and make payments in Bitcoins, or dollars, or whatever,” says Phil Rapoport, Ripple’s director of trading and markets. It’s all the convenience of Bitcoin (to the extent there is any convenience in using Bitcoin) without the Bitcoin risk. All you have to worry about are the massive fluctuations in the price of gold.

       " \" So you've gotten your hands on a brand new PlayStation 4, and are ready to crack into some next-generation gaming. Yay! Whether you unwrapped a new PlayStation 4 for the holidays, or you picked one up as soon as they went on sale, the new consoles offers a lot of possibilities out of the box. If you want to get the most of out your console, we've prepared a handy guide to all the things you can take advantage without too much hassle. Set Up Your PS4 The PlayStation 4 connects to all applications and services via a PlayStation Network account. You can either create a new account when you first sign in to the console, or import your current one — the latter will import your friends and trophies from the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.  You can now also associate your PlayStation Network account with your Facebook account, and you have the option to pull in your real name and Facebook profile picture to your PlayStation Network identity.  After you've created your account and downloaded a 300 MB day-one update, you're pretty much good to jump in and start using your PlayStation 4. Get PlayStation Plus Your PlayStation Network account allows access to a handful of the console's online services, including access to video-on-demand apps like Netflix and the ability to message your friends. But annual subscription service PlayStation Plus gives a lot more value to the PlayStation 4 for $50 per year. PlayStation Plus users get access to free games every month, and those often include interesting indie games you might not find otherwise. For instance, indie titles Contrast and Resogun are available as free downloads with the PlayStation 4 right now. Games you download for free remain on your console until your PlayStation Plus membership lapses. Members can also receive discounts on some new games.  The PlayStation Plus subscription is also necessary to play games online with friends, or to save your games in the cloud. Game On The PlayStation 4 isn't backwards compatible with older games on the PS3, so you'll be starting your collection from scratch with this new console. Thankfully, for those not interested in hitting a retail store, almost everything out for the PS4 is available to purchase digitally through the PlayStation Store.  There's a wide variety of first- and third-party releases on the PlayStation 4. You can see the console's full launch lineup here.  Check Out Free-to-Play Titles There are a couple of free-to-play games available through the PlayStation Store, with more to come in the future, Sony promises. For shooter fans, there is Blacklight: Retribution, a sci-fi FPS with a variety of multiplayer game modes and maps available for free. Players can play online with friends, or join a match with other PS4 gamers. The game's monetization focuses on the weapons and cosmetic upgrades, though players won't hit a paywall during play or have to pay a monthly fee. For those passionate about superheroes, massively multiplayer RPG DC Universe Online is also free to download and play on the PS4. This MMO was developed by Sony and Warner Brothers, and already has an established player base on the PC and PlayStation 3. You'll be able to create either a hero or villain, then ally yourself with mentors like Batman or Lex Luthor. Then you can explore familiar settings such as Metropolis or Gotham City as you level your character. Upgrade Your Old Games With two new consoles coming out this holiday season, big game publishers didn't want to lose out on customers who were unsure if they should pick up the current- or next-gen versions of 2013's best-selling games. So if you picked up Battlefield 4, Call of Duty: Ghosts or Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag for the PlayStation 3, you'll be able to upgrade those games to digital versions for only $9.99. Sony has put a complete guide to upgrading on its website. It's important to note you'll need to hold on to your game discs even after the upgrade, as your PS4 will still need to validate them each time you play.  Share Everything on Social Facebook's integration with the PS4 isn't just so you can put your real name and picture on your PlayStation Network account. The social platform is integrated into many facets of the new console, so you can share as much of your gaming experience as you'd like. The PlayStation 4 controller features a Share button, which you can tap at any time during gameplay. You can then choose to share videos, screenshots or stream your games live.  The PlayStation 4 automatically captures your last 15 minutes of gameplay on video, so any jaw-dropping moments are saved as soon as they happen. By pressing Share, you can grab the recent video clip and trim it down with simple editing tools. You then have the option of adding a title and description, then posting that clip to your Facebook page.  The same applies for screenshots, though the Share button captures the last image after you press it, so you'll have to get your timing down to capture any action shots. You can share these screenshots via Facebook along with Twitter. Finally, there's the option to stream your gameplay live to Ustream or Twitch and invite your friends to watch. Both services require you to set up accounts, but once you've done that, it's easy to start streaming on the fly. You'll be able to set up a title and description for your stream, then announce to Facebook and Twitter that you are currently playing live. You'll be able to use the PlayStation 4's included microphone to talk over your game, and if you've sprung for the extra PlayStation Camera you can add a webcam view to your broadcast. The Twitch UI also allows players to see real-time comments that viewers are making on their stream at the bottom of the screen.  Get Entertained For those who want to also use the PlayStation 4 for on-demand video, the console comes loaded with plenty of options. The big video-on-demand apps are already listed under the main menu's Entertainment tab, with nine options available at launch: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Redbox Instant, Crunchyroll, Crackle, Vudu, Epix, NBA Game Time, NHL Game Center Live and YuppTV.  Sony also offers its own digital rental or download service for movies and television, accessible through the PlayStation Store. It includes titles that have recently hit DVD, and currently running television shows. No matter what you decide to do, your new PlayStation 4 is sure to have even more fun games and other experiences available down the line. Image: Mashable, Christina Ascani \",\n",
       " '     If a new ad is to be believed, it\\'s possible we were all wrong about Uncle Sam\\'s gesture, that maybe he wasn\\'t pointing at us to try to recruit us into the army, but to give us a medical exam. The iconic symbol of the U.S. government appears in a strange video posted to YouTube Wednesday by Generation Opportunity, a right-wing group whose mission is to sway young people on issues such as student loan debt, Internet sales tax and healthcare.  See also: How Is Information Technology Changing Healthcare? The video features a young woman on a visit to the gynecologist. The nurse notes that the woman has attained insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the comprehensive health reform law colloquially known as \"Obamacare.\" When the time comes to conduct the exam, however, the doctor instead leaves the room. We won\\'t spoil the ending, but it pivots around the character Generation Opportunity is calling \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" and a very frightened patient. The group also posted a similar video that features a young man visiting the doctor for a prostate exam. The videos, which encourage young people to opt out of Obamacare, sport text that reads, \"don\\'t let the government play doctor\" and appears on screen at the end of each commercial. While the videos posted to YouTube are more creepy than informative, Generation Opportunity President Evan Feinberg said that\\'s the point — the group hopes to get people\\'s attention with the videos and establish itself as a resource young people can use to explore their healthcare options. \"Right now there\\'s a lot of confusion around the law,\" Feinberg told Mashable. \"Millions of young Americans are going to hear the important educational message — that they have the ability to opt out of Obamacare — because of the reach that our message is going to have because of the creepiness of the video. Not to mention the fact that Obamacare is creepy, so it\\'s important for people realize that,\" he opined. Generation Opportunity plans to supplement the videos with usable information during a tour of college campuses starting later this month. The group has not yet released details of the tour.  The group describes itself as \"a free-thinking, liberty-loving, national organization of young people promoting the best of being American: opportunity, creativity and freedom.\" It also receives substantial funding from the politically active billionaire businessmen David and Charles Koch. \"We\\'re unabashed advocates for young people, and we\\'re happy to work with people who support that mission and vision,\" Feinberg said when asked about his group\\'s connection to the Koch brothers, whose political donations to right-wing causes far exceed $100 million.  In addition to trying to inform and persuade people about their options regarding the healthcare law according to the group\\'s ideology, the videos also ask viewers to sign and share a petition declaring their intentions to opt out. \"Good news: you are not required to purchase health insurance through an Obamacare exchange! There are cheaper, better options for young people,\" reads the descriptions of the videos on YouTube.  Specifics about those better options are conspicuously absent from the videos and their descriptions. They also doesn\\'t mention the potential penalties attached to opting out. Last month, the IRS announced (.PDF) that the penalty for not obtaining insurance under the Affordable Care Act starts at $95 or 1% of household income in 2014, eventually increasing to $695 in 2016. Generation Opportunity\\'s videos don\\'t suggest young people forego insurance all together, but they also don\\'t offer any alternatives to the Affordable Care Act\\'s insurance exchanges, whose success, economists have argued, depends on everyone participating, especially the young and healthy.     What, if anything, do you think these videos add to the conversation about the Affordable Care Act? Let us know by commenting below. Image: YouTube, MyGenOpportunity ',\n",
       " ' Eugene\\'s an a-hole. Abraham\\'s backstory is as messy as a parking lot of water-soaked walkers. And toilet water is cool to drink in a pinch. We learned all this and more in the latest episode of The Walking Dead. But let\\'s start with Abraham because he\\'s important in this entire equation.  See also: 10 tweets that perfectly sum up Beth\\'s big hour on \\'The Walking Dead\\' In this episode, we learned that Abraham\\'s family fled after the zombie apocalypse brought out his violent side. (Or, one could wonder, maybe he was a violent person all along.) Nonetheless, after seeing Abraham beat several men to death, his family fled one night and left him only with a note in which they instructed him not go looking for them.  That\\'s a bold statement to make at a time when the world is scarier than ever.  But Abraham did eventually find them — dead, that is. And upon seeing that his wife, daughter and son were no longer among the living, Abraham was prepared to kill himself...until Eugene emerged from the woods, being chased by walkers, and tells him what turns out to be a huge lie.  Eugene, essentially, gave Abraham a reason to live. So, what, we\\'re left to wonder by the end of the episode, is Abraham to do when he learns the truth: Eugene is not a scientist and does not have a cure.  Toldja: Eugene = a-hole.  This revelation comes after an episode that finally saw Eugene man up a bit. In one scene in particular, he killed walkers with a firehouse, which was simultaneously cool and kind of a dick move, considering they were drinking toilet water.  Then, after trying but failing to sabotage the mission to D.C., he confessed: \"I lied. I\\'m not a scientist. I don\\'t know how to stop it.\" Comic book readers apparently knew this was coming. They knew that Eugene was only lying to ensure his survival, to ensure he had a team. (Disclaimer: I have not read them and was accordingly peeved.)  But now we\\'re left to wonder: Is the gang going to head to D.C. anyway? As Eugene pointed out, D.C. — being the nation\\'s capital and all — is likely a place with some sort of stability and safety. Are they going to let Abraham go full Abraham on Eugene again? Is Eugene even still alive? Or are they going to toss him to the herd of stinky walkers now blocking their path?  Time will tell.  Meanwhile, here are my 10 favorite Tweets about \"Self-Help\": 10.

       " ' BlackBerry Ltd., the Canadian smartphone maker, rose to the highest price in a month after Reuters reported the company is considering going private. The stock climbed 3.9% to $9.59 at 9:40 a.m. in New York and earlier traded at $9.89, the highest level since July 9. Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario-based company had lost 22% this year through yesterday. Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins and the board are coming around to the idea that going private would give them the leeway to fix problems out of the public view, Reuters reported, citing unidentified sources. While there is a change of tone on the board, no deal is imminent, according to the story. The company, which released its new BlackBerry 10 lineup this year in a bid to win back market share, has suffered from lackluster demand and a fizzling stock rally. Last month, the price of its Z10 flagship touch-screen model was cut to $49.99 amid sluggish sales. The phone had originally gone on sale in the U.S. in March for $199.99 with a two-year contract. Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman for BlackBerry, declined to comment to Bloomberg on the report. Before Heins became CEO in January 2012, the company held talks with private-equity firm Silver Lake about possibly going private, a person familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg News that year. The talks were preliminary and the two sides weren’t able to agree on a potential valuation, the person said. BlackBerry has held recent discussions with Silver Lake about collaborating in enterprise computing, though the talks didn’t involve a buyout or other transaction, Reuters said. Last month, Heins reiterated that the company was seeking partners to expand the footprint of its BlackBerry 10 operating system and help with its turnaround. “We will do our homework and assess what we think is best for the company and then we will have discussions and they will either yield partnerships, alliances or not,” Heins told shareholders in July at BlackBerry’s annual meeting in Waterloo.

       " ' Welcome to Throwback Tunesday, where Mashable amplifies the echoes of music past. With genre trends and throwbacks, we synthesize music and nostalgia. Josh Ocean and Eric ‘Doc’ Mendelsohn of Ghost Beach know a thing or two about nostalgia. They\\'ve integrated their love for the \\'80s/\\'90s into tropical, synth-driven electro-pop; the duo\\'s \"retro-future\" sound reveals a deep love for these decades. When describing how this past-meets-future aesthetic was born, Ocean recalls, \"When we came together and started discovering and playing with analog synths (we have a whole collection of synths that were used in the ‘80s), we wanted to try to manipulate those in a modern kind of a way through computer programs.\" Ghost Beach developed naturally from there on: \"We just love music from the ‘80s and ‘90s, and we love songwriting. It just felt right. It seeped into our subconscious and so we did it,\" says Ocean. And it\\'s working for them. Ghost Beach will be touring with Cherub through November and just dropped PROM\\'s single, \"Flickers,\" via their own label, Crazy Heart — the label\\'s first-ever release. See also: Charli XCX on \\'Clueless,\\' the Spice Girls and \\'90s Fashion Mashable chatted with Ghost Beach\\'s Josh Ocean about one of his favorite decades and the memories that came with it, and combined them into a playlist. From The Smashing Pumpkins to the Baywatch theme song, we reminisce by way of \\'90s music. 1. k.d lang — “Constant Craving”   Ocean: I think that we both have talked about that song so much because it stands out as one of those random songs that makes an impression. For me, it was when I was watching VH1 at my grandma’s house (because I didn\\'t have cable at home). I remember that song playing, and if my mom was in the room, she\\'d be like, “I love this song!” It was one of those early videos that stuck out.  2. Annie Lennox — \"No More \\'I Love You\\'s\\'\" The crossing dressing male ballerinas were always creepy, but this song just always pulled me in.  Annie Lennox is one of our all time favorites — we love everything she did with Eurythmics, and this song was another one of those quintessential shocking music videos for an 8-year-old to watch. It was really bold; her facial expressions were kind of crazy. There were cross-dressing male ballerina dudes singing the falsetto parts. It’s weird, but the song is so good. The vocals are so good.  3. Enigma — \"Return to Innocence\" For some reason when I put together this playlist, I was in the mindset of visiting my grandma, so this should be the “visiting my grandma’s house” playlist [laughs]. I remember when we heard this song, we were taken aback by the use of the vocal samples. It was sort of ethnic — I don\\'t know exactly where that sample’s lifted from — but it’s so cool. And it was so original. I remember taking the single tape that I bought and playing it at the dinner table for my grandma, being like, “Listen to how cool this is!”  4. The Smashing Pumpkins — \"Today\" I grew up on Fire Island, which is a summer community. It was a really cool place to be a kid. In season, we\\'d play games at the arcade every night. This reminds me of playing video games in the local arcade and feeling the rush of the blue raspberry Slush Puppie I was enjoying. That was just one of the songs that was always playing on the jukebox. It really reminded me of playing foosball and just feeling so happy in the moment. 5. Baywatch theme song Super fun — there’s nothing more ‘90s than that song to us. There’s just so much to play with and poke fun of in that song. There’s definitely been comparisons of that song with some of the songs we\\'ve done. I just really, truly loved watching that show when I was a kid. Just sitting on my dad’s couch, watching Baywatch. I loved the beach, I loved the lifeguards — I wanted to be a lifeguard. It was really important. And it was a catchy song.  6. The Cardigans — \"Lovefool\" I love The Cardigans, I’ve always loved The Cardigans, and that song was their biggest hit. I loved that whole album. This may have been the start of my Swedish pop music obsession — they\\'re really like the first Swedish band that I was actually really, really into. “Lovefool” was my introduction to the band.  And then they put out a song on the Austin Powers soundtrack, which was really my favorite, but nobody would know what it is. I think the song’s called “Carnival.” 7. Sublime — \"What I Got\"  That’s gotta be on everybody’s ‘90s playlist. That’s another one of those songs that was playing in the arcade when I was a kid. It really got me into music — got me into really wanting to listen to music, to listen to it more closely and learn everything about the band — dive into everything. That album was definitely very transformative. It was the end of the ‘90s, and I was 12 or so when I found the song. It was a major discovery for me. This song really got me seriously into the idea of making music and being in a band and was the beginning my dive into California surf skate punk.  Was this where the whole tropical aesthetic started? I think that the tropical aesthetic comes from growing up on the beach, in a summer community. I\\'ve always loved surfing and the ocean — and I eventually went to college in Hawaii. The beach culture has always been important. But really, definitely Sublime plays a huge part in that. They\\'re surfer/skate dudes from Long Beach, California, so it fits in the vibe of what I\\'ve always thought was so cool and natural.  8. Len  — \"Steal My Sunshine\" This is definitely late ‘90s, but the song is just so awesome. I should have hit on more stuff from the whole decade, but every time I do a playlist and I can include that song and it’s relevant, I will. I think that song is super fun. It\\'s a real pop song — a guilty pleasure pop song — but it’s something I was never afraid to admit that I liked. What are your ultimate \\'90s songs? Tell us in the comments.  ',\n",

       " ' We\\'ve all seen (and some of us have been) that person on Facebook — the over-sharer. Some of us may be happy to divulge every intimate detail of our personal lives; others are more private.  Social networks for families (FamilyLeaf, MyFamily.com, Rootsy, Origami), neighbors (Nextdoor), and select groups of family and friends (Path), have bloomed in the past few years. A growing number of us, it seems, want a more intimate online sharing experience.  On FamilyLeaf, as with other social sites meant for small groups, users can share photos and messages with their connections on a secure network.  \"Many of our most active users are turned off by Facebook\\'s openness — and they use FamilyLeaf because it\\'s meant only for family,\" Co-founder Ajay Mehta says.  Connecting to family on Facebook results in limited sharing between family members, however. The presence of younger members limit what their relatives can see. \"There\\'s a disconnect,\" says Mehta. \"Older members of the family create Facebook accounts just for family members, but they can\\'t understand the complexities, while younger people tend to restrict their family members\\' access to their Facebook, even if they accept them as \\'friends\\' in the first place.  \"The kind of content users share on both services is simply different, and users love FamilyLeaf because we all have memories, photo albums, and conversations that are meant to stay within the family.\"  The cofounder of FamilyLeaf, Wesley Zhao, says sites like this are important to his family relationship since Facebook is blocked in his native China. With FamilyLeaf, for the first time in years, his family in China were able to see updates and photos from his American branch of his family.

       " ' Apple recently acquired a small company that specializes in designing communications chips that use very little power, Passif Semiconductor. The purchase gives Apple more resources to tap for its venture into wearable computing, which appears inevitable. The acquisition, first reported by tech reporter Jessica Lessin, happened in \"recent months.\" Passif, founded by two Ph.D. students from the University of Berkeley, worked on developing chips with radios that consume very little power and work with the Bluetooth Smart (a.k.a 4.0 and Low Energy) standard.

Apple is rumored to be working on a smart watch called the iWatch and has recently gone so far as to trademark the name in several countries. Apple more or less confirmed the acquisition to several publications with the statement that \"Apple buys small technology companies from time to time.\" The amount paid for Passif was not disclosed.

       " ' Apple and IBM got a jump start on what\\'s sure to be a busy 2015 in business technologies by announcing on Wednesday their first wave of mobile app collaborations. The companies, which partnered up earlier this year, unveiled what they\\'re calling IBM MobileFirst for iOS solutions. In other words, enterprise-class apps that work on iPhones and iPads. See also: What to expect from Apple in 2015 These aren\\'t apps that will show up in your App Store. Instead, these specialized apps (10 in all) are designed for businesses and work directly with IBM\\'s industry-centric analytics and cloud-based services. They also, according to IBM, have baked-in security, which spans across the apps, data and the iPads and iPhones themselves. All of the apps were, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, developed in Apple\\'s new Swift programming language for iOS. The collaboration allows IBM to take advantage of \"Apple’s legendary user experience and excellence in product design,\" said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for IBM Global Business Services, in a statement. A common trait among all these new apps is, naturally, mobility. Advise & Grow, for instance, is intended to be used while bankers visit small business clients. Case Advice gives government case workers access to real-time analytics while they\\'re making site visits. And Sales Assist for the retail industry will give clerks access to customer information so they can assist them from anywhere in their store.  The IBM MobileFirst for iOS Incident Aware App offers law enforcement officers real-time access to maps and video-feeds of incident locations; information about victim status, escalation risk and crime history. Image:  Apple and IBMAlso included are a pair of new travel apps: Plan Flight (for more effective fuel management) and Passenger+ (a customer service app). \"Fuel is an airline\\'s greatest operating expense, so reducing discretionary fuel is critical to us,\" said Jim Tabor, an Air Canada vice president, in a press release. \"Today, dispatchers and pilots determine how much extra fuel is loaded onto a plane based largely on current factors and their individual judgment,\" but the Plan Flight app will offer recommendations based on \"weather conditions, anticipated taxi time and historical data,\" he said. Other apps include Retention (for insurance workers), Trusted Advice (for banking and finance) and Incident Aware (which could be used by law enforcement agencies for real-time information on victim status and escalation risks). Worlds combine IBM and Apple are obviously not new to the mobile business, but Apple had hit a ceiling with enterprise integration. Many Fortune 500 businesses build their own custom software that ties back into legacy data systems and often deploy it on traditional systems, like desktops and laptops.  The partnership with IBM essentially breaks through that ceiling by letting IBM handle the task of tying these apps back into legacy data and analytics, but doing it all through IBM\\'s cloud. For Apple, the IBM partnership allows enterprise-level apps to live on iOS, further integrating iPads and iPhones into big business and, of course, opening up new market opportunities. As the iPad market slows down, success in the enterprise will be critical to its continued growth. Many analysts believe Apple will try to boost its business success in 2015 with a larger iPad. The other key element here is that IBM, not Apple, will handle the integration and on-site support side, which makes sense since many of the companies in these key industries — transportation, government, finance and retail — are already accustomed to working with IBM on software and services integration. The partnership may present some new challenges to Apple. Not only are these apps custom-built for enterprise, they\\'re further customized by IBM for each client. So Apple and and IBM have to win on a client-by-client basis. Employees can\\'t simply download the apps and start using them. From the iOS device to the app, it will all be approved by the corporations and fully integrated into their business. Thus far, only Citi, Air Canada, Sprint and Mexico\\'s Banorte bank have announced support for IBM MobileFirst. 2015 will likely be the real test for the Apple and IBM collaboration. ',\n",

       " ' What started out as a 10-minute telescope lesson turned into something much more exciting, as a group of astronomy students at the University College London raced against encroaching cloud cover to document an amazing scientific discovery. On the night Jan. 21, astronomer Steve Fossey was showing undergraduates how to use a telescope at the University of London Observatory when they spotted a star explosion in Messier 82, a nearby galaxy. \"The weather was closing in, with increasing cloud, so instead of the planned practical astronomy class, I gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the CCD camera on one of the observatory\\'s automated 13.7-inch telescopes,\" Fossey said in a statement form UCL.  SEE ALSO: More Photos of the new Supernova in Galaxy M82           Four students — Ben Cooke, Tom Wright, Matthew Wilde and Guy Pollack — picked M82 as their observation target. The galaxy, also called the Cigar Galaxy, is some 12 million light-years away and it is a popular target for small telescopes because it is bright and quite photogenic. On this particular night, M82 was also one of the few lights visible in a clear patch of the sky over London. Fossey noticed what looked like a star overlaid on the galaxy while he was adjusting the telescope. The team checked an online archive of M82 images and found that this object wasn\\'t there before. With more clouds rolling in, the team rushed to capture a series of 1- and 2-minute exposures of the galaxy through different colored filters. They also set up another telescope to check that their sighting wasn\\'t just an anomaly, according to UCL. Studying the New Supernova The cosmic blast occurred when a white dwarf detonated some 12 million years ago — at a time when the human lineage Homo didn\\'t exist yet and the Amazon River hadn\\'t formed — but it is so far away that the light is just reaching Earth now. That said, it\\'s also one of the closest star explosions to be observed in modern times. The supernova is perhaps only bested by the SN 1987A star explosion that suddenly appeared in the sky nearly three decades ago in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way, some 168,000 light-years from Earth. The discovery has been confirmed by the International Astronomical Union, which gave the supernova the official designation SN 2014J. The star explosion is expected to brighten through the first week of February; by then it might be visible with just a pair of binoculars. M82\\'s new bright spot can actually be picked out in images of the galaxy taken up to a week before it was spotted by students at UCL, according to NASA officials. But since their exciting night, both professional astronomers in observatories and amateur astronomers in their backyards have pointed their telescopes at M82. Even NASA\\'s Swift spacecraft turned its gaze to the star explosion, capturing images of the new supernova from its perch high above Earth in visible, near-ultraviolet and mid-ultraviolet wavelengths. \"Finding and publicizing new supernova discoveries is often the weak link in obtaining rapid observations, but once we know about it, Swift frequently can observe a new object within hours,\" Neil Gehrels, the Swift mission\\'s principal investigator at NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in a statement. Early observations of SN 2014J indicate it is a Type Ia supernova — the kind astronomers use as \"standard candles\" to measure distances across the universe because they explode with astonishingly similar intrinsic brightness. (Careful study of Type Ia supernovas even led to the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.) Because M82 is filled with thick dust clouds, the supernova also gives astronomers the chance to study how interstellar dust affects the light of these standard candles, NASA officials said. The space agency has planned additional observations of the supernova with its other observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (or NuSTAR for short) and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It\\'s possible that these spacecraft will find the first conclusive evidence of high-energy gamma rays and X-rays coming from a supernova, said Peter Brown, an astrophysicist at Texas A&M University who is using Swift to study supernovas.  \\'Invisible Behavior\\' In Martian Atmosphere Brought To Light In Ultraviolet | Video Hurricane Matthew Trashes Iconic NASA Beach House Juno Jupiter Probe\\'s Final Engine Burn Delayed by Glitch  Orbital ATK Will Try to Launch Antares Rocket Tonight: Watch It Live   This article originally published at Space.com here  ',\n",

       " '     The Father of the Internet wants to lay some wisdom and warnings on all of you. In a new video posted by Google, a cartoon version of Vint Cerf, who is widely recognized as one of the fathers of the Internet (along with Bob Kahn), explains the Internet address system and some of the near-term hurdles it faces. See also: How to Use the Internet for Foreplay The two-and-a-half-minute animated video is mostly an Internet Address system explainer that highlights Cerf\\'s and Khan\\'s role in, essentially, birthing the Internet we know and love today. The pair worked on the Internet\\'s predecessor, a Defense Dept. project called Arpanet. As Cerf says in the video, \"Like any good father, I’m going to bend your ear with a story about my kid.\" However, the tone takes a bit of a left turn as Cerf explains how the United Stated is set to give up its address naming system oversight. As Mashable noted in March, \"An agreement between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is set to expire in 2015 and will not be renewed if a changeover plan is developed.\" Even though the U.S. role in this process has decreased in recent years, the International community has been calling on the U.S. to relinquish its remaining control of the Internet\\'s naming system. Google, which has employed Cerf since 2005, is, of course, a U.S.-based company. It also has a vested interest in someone watching over the system that helps assign IP addresses and web URLs. It wants to make it clear that \"the U.S. isn\\'t giving away its authority and evil superpowers aren\\'t taking over in response.\"  Google worries that any change in ICANN\\'s status could leave the Internet vulnerable.Image:  GoogleTo ensure that, Google and Cerf say the U.S. is committed to placing the control of the domain name and Internet address structure system in the hands of an international multi-stakeholder community. In other words, it desperately wants ICANN to remain an independent, non-governmental body. ICANN CEO and president Fadi Chehadé told Mashable earlier this year that giving up control will have no impact on the average consumer. However, Google\\'s video appears to indicate there is some fear that the transition could end up in the wrong hands and reminds the viewer that a transition to a non-governmental management, international body is critical for maintaining the \"purity of the Internet.\" If, after watching the video, anyone is unclear about Google\\'s intentions, the clip links to Google\\'s Take Action website, which calls on visitors to join 3 million others who have signed on asking for a \"free and open Internet\" ',\n",

The video — full of cowgirl boots, sharks and horses — debuted on Facebook on Sunday night, following in the footsteps of other Facebook premieres this year, including \"Gorilla\" from Bruno Mars and \"Holy Grail\" from Jay Z.  See also: Gaga and R. Kelly Spark Instagram Scandal of Presidential Proportions Pitbull, the host of the AMAs, and Kesha performed the song at the awards show. The single, from Pitbull\\'s upcoming Global Warming: Meltdown album, holds the No. 4 position on the iTunes tops songs chart. Watch the video, below:   Post by Pitbull. The duo\\'s performance at the AMAs was the most-TiVo\\'d moment of the night, TiVo told Mashable:   BONUS: The 10 Most Epic Celebrity Twitter Fights    Celebrity Twitter Fights        1. Amanda Bynes vs. Rihanna Looking for a way to amp up the drama, Amanda Bynes took her Twitter sass to a whole new level in May with a seemingly unwarranted attack on pop star Rihanna and Chrissy Teigen of Sports Illustrated fame, calling both stars ugly. In one particularly notable moment, the former child star suggested Chris Brown\\'s 2009 abuse of Rihanna was a result of her being \"not pretty enough.\" Ms. Bynes, that is a new low.           2. Alec Baldwin vs. George Stark Alec Baldwin quit Twitter again this summer following an article by journalist George Stark of the Daily Mail. The piece falsely accused Baldwin\\'s pregnant wife, Hilaria Thomas, of tweeting during the funeral of James Gandolfini. The rant is still causing a stir for the 30 Rock star, as conservative activists demand that Capital One drop him as a spokesperson due to the homophobic nature of his tweets. Baldwin has since apologized for his language but not for defending his wife.           3. Directioners vs. British GQ Hell hath no fury like a fandom scorned. British GQ got a taste of that hell when the magazine released its One Direction covers in July. The tagline under Harry Styles\\' cover, \"He\\'s up all night to get lucky,\" evoked such rage from Directioners that GQ\\'s servers couldn\\'t handle the influx of hate tweets.           4. Perez Hilton vs. Amanda Bynes  It was only a matter of time before these two butted heads. After Hilton posted a photo from an alleged eyewitness who spotted Bynes jumping on a trampoline, Bynes replied with her usual onslaught of \"ugly\" tweets. Eventually, Bynes insisted Hilton commit suicide. No stranger to death threats, Hilton expressed his concern for Bynes and his hope that she receive treatment.  On May 31, Bynes eventually retracted her statements about the blogger, saying, \"you\\'re not ugly! I was lying because we haven\\'t talked in person in a long time. Please stop being mean on twitter! Thx!\"  How nice.            5. Perez Hilton vs. will.i.am In one of the most famous Twitter feuds of all time, Perez Hilton ended up with a black eye after calling will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas a \"f***cking f*ggot.\" While it\\'s unclear who exactly gave Hilton the shiner, will.i.am posted a vlog insisting it was not him. Regardless who actually threw the punch, Hilton took to Twitter to seek help from the police. You know, because 911 is too old school.           6. Perez Hilton vs. Lady Gaga  In a more recent Twitter feud, Hilton found himself on the wrong side of Lady Gaga\\'s little monsters when he was seen in the lobby of Gaga\\'s apartment building in New York. Gaga accused Hilton of stalking her, despite his insistence it was nothing more than innocent house-hunting. Gaga\\'s fans also let their claws out, voicing death threats and derogatory comments about Hilton\\'s six-month-old son.  Hilton, who was once friends with the pop star, insisted that the \"real\" Lady Gaga was different than her public persona, calling her \"cruel\" and insisting he was \"still healing, removing your knife from my heart\" after the two\\'s apparent fallout.            7. Rob Kardashian vs. Rita Ora   Plenty of celebs take to tweeting after a breakup, but it\\'s hard to beat a Kardashian when it comes to drama. Rob K took to the Twittersphere to bash ex Rita Ora, saying she cheated on him with no less than 20 other men. While Ora remained mostly silent on the subject, one errant tweet did surface before it was quickly erased: \"Rob’s d--k was wack, I had to go get it somewhere else.\"  Kardashian didn\\'t take kindly to the insult, hinting he had gotten Ora pregnant. That exchanged remained on the site only briefly before it was taken down.  One party who did remain positive throughout the feud? Rob\\'s sister Khloe, who offered some advice: \"Cheaters never prosper @RobKardashian ill be home today... Try and smile little brother.\"            8. Chris Brown vs. Jenny Johnson  While Chris Brown was no one\\'s favorite person after the abuse scandal surrounding girlfriend Rihanna, one comedienne in particular, Texas-based writer Jenny Johnson, wanted to let the R&B singer know just how she felt about him. A little bit of harassment went a long way, and it didn\\'t take too long for Brown to delete his account, but not before he tweeted: \"Just ask Rihanna if she mad??????\"  Brown\\'s account has since been reactivated.            9. Rhianna vs. Chris Brown  Now that Brown has returned to Twitter, fans can follow his breakup drama with on-again, off-again girlfriend Rihanna. The tumultuous trainwreck that is the Rihanna/Chris Brown relationship just won\\'t go away, with the breakup feud continuing through August.  RiRi tweeted an image bearing the words \"If I drop all my hoes for you and we still don\\'t work out you owe me some hoes.\" While the sentiment seems pretty clear, Brown\\'s \"She\\'s not mine if she\\'s everybody else\\'s\" tweet definitely left no room for doubt about the reason for the pair\\'s latest breakup.             10. Nick Cannon vs. Chelsea Handler After the acid-tongued Handler jabbed Cannon\\'s comedy tour, saying: \"I just heard nick cannon is starting a comedy tour. Who’s going to do the comedy?\" Cannon was clearly a little peeved at the tweet, but didn\\'t really let loose until Handler posted a TwitPic of grape soda with the tweet \"pls drink this before you  tweet me again.\" It was at this point that Cannon wilded out (sorry not sorry for that one), letting loose the slew of angry tweets (plus a few more) that you see above.           BONUS: Patton Oswalt vs. John Tesh Leave it to Internet favorite Patton Oswalt to create one of the punniest feuds on this list. When radio host John Tesh sent out a request for new hashtag ideas, Patton Oswalt gave a couple of suggestions, none of which seemed up to Tesh\\'s high standards.

       " \" Many federal agencies are still failing to give government scientists adequate freedom to communicate their research and findings with the public, according to a new report by a scientific advocacy group. A report released Friday by The Center for Science and Democracy gave many federal agencies mixed grades for their media and social media policies. Out of 17 science-oriented agencies reviewed, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration topped out CSD’s 2013 overall report card, with an A grade for media policy and a B for use of social media. Bottoming out the list was the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which received ‘D’ grades in both categories. Several others received “incompletes” because researchers could not obtain the agency’s media policies in time.  CSD, a division of the Union for Concerned Scientists, said that the Obama administration had made marked improvement in giving scientists the freedom and ability to speak with the public. The group commissioned a similar report in 2008, and said that agencies had definitely improved since then. However, they said, some attempts to “silence scientists” indicated that problems still exist. Gretchen Goldman, an analyst with CSD, emphasized that scientists don’t give up their First Amendment freedoms when they decide to work for the government. They need to have the ability to communicate their views with the public, she said. “The public deserves access to the science they’re funding, especially when it comes to research about our health and safety,” Goldman said in a statement. In a corresponding document released with the report, CSD said an ideal media policy should include an accessible and flexible public affairs office, protection of scientific free speech, and promotion of openness and transparency. The U.S. Geological Survey had already responded\\xa0to the report with updates to its own media policy by Friday afternoon. The report gave NASA a B and a B+ for its media and social media policies, respectively. NASA has been commended by outside observers for its extensive use of social media, including a recent extraterrestrial Google+ hangout. The National Institutes of Health was the only agency to receive an A for its social media policy. The CSD said that NIH’s coherent New Media Checklist helped employees understand what they could and couldn’t do with social media. Still, Goldman cited NASA’s prodigious Twitter following when showing the potential that social media had for the government. “Agencies shouldn’t be afraid to let scientists experiment with social media,” Goldman said. “When NASA has as many Twitter followers as Anderson Cooper, it’s clear that social media has huge potential for science communication.” Image courtesy of NASA  Here's Donald Trump's Plan to Dominate Cyber Toyota Is Releasing a Chatty Robot that Sits in Your Car’s Cupholder What’s Next in Tech?

       " ' Iran will begin eliminating its nuclear stockpile on Jan. 20, after striking a deal with six world powers regarding its uranium-enrichment program, Iranian officials announced Sunday. The United States, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany reached an agreement with Iran in November, saying that they will ease international sanctions in exchange for proof that the country is not going to develop nuclear weapons.  See also: Instagram Gets Blocked, Then Unblocked in Iran As part of the deal, Iran will start destroying some of its uranium stockpile on Jan. 20. That will be the official start date for the six-month interim deal, which is designed to give negotiators time to reach a more sweeping agreement. In the meantime, Iran will enforce a series of measures to freeze its uranium-enrichment program.  For U.S. officials, Sunday\\'s announcement is an important step toward making sure Iran doesn\\'t develop a nuclear bomb. \"We\\'ve taken a critical, significant step forward towards reaching a verifiable resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"As of that day, for the first time in almost a decade, Iran’s nuclear program will not be able to advance, and parts of it will be rolled back, while we start negotiating a comprehensive agreement to address the international community’s concerns about Iran’s program.\" As part of the agreement, Iran will stop the enrichment of uranium above 5% purity, neutralize its stockpile of uranium enriched at 20% purity, stop installing any new centrifuge or build new enrichment facilities, and will give inspectors daily access to its already existing nuclear facilities, according to The New York Times. In exchange, the United States and its negotiating partners will ease economic sanctions on Iran, and provide \"limited and targeted relief.\" Iran will also gain access to $4.2 billion in \"restricted Iranian assets,\" which \"will be released in regular installments throughout the six months,\" Kerry said in his statement.  Despite this progress, U.S. President Barack Obama has expressed cautious optimism.  \"I have no illusions about how hard it will be to achieve this objective, but for the sake of our national security and the peace and security of the world, now is the time to give diplomacy a chance to succeed,\" Obama said in a statement, according to USA Today. Iran\\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi also said this deal is just the first step. \"After the first step is taken, then in a short period of time we will again start our contacts for resumption of negotiations for the implementation of the final step,\" he said, according to Reuters. \"We don\\'t trust them ... Each step has been designed in a way that allows us to stop carrying out our commitments if we see the other party is not fulfilling its commitments.\" In the past, Iran has consistently denied trying to develop a nuclear bomb, arguing that its enrichment efforts were exclusively aimed at developing nuclear energy. Ahead of the November deal, Iran launched an aggressive campaign in support of its program, which included an unprecedented website in English. Image:Handout/Getty Images News/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' United States President Barack Obama is likely to order a series of executive actions before the end of the year that would transform the American immigration system, without consulting Congress. Republicans are—in a word—livid.  The GOP wants to have a significant say in the immigration reform debate, and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to shut down the government if the president goes through with his plan.  See also: What happened to the debate over immigration reform? Below, we talk about what both sides want, why this debate is coming to a head, and what it means for the country\\'s immediate future.  What does Obama want?  Light is reflected on Sara Ramirez, of Gaithersburg, Md., as she rallies for comprehensive immigration reform outside the White House in Washington on Nov. 7.Image: Jacquelyn Martin/Associated PressObama is reportedly preparing to enact a string of executive actions that would prevent the deportation of up to five million unauthorized immigrants and provide many of them with work permits.  The number of unauthorized immigrants who do receive protections depends on the particulars of Obama\\'s actions, once he decides to roll them out, which he is likely to do by the end of 2014. Perhaps the biggest part of the president\\'s plan is an action that would allow the parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents to receive work documentation. That action would affect around 3.3 million people who have been in the country for five or more years, and would relieve parents from the worry that they would one day be sent back to their nations of origin. A different version of this plan would only extend benefits to the roughly 2.5 million unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for a decade.  The Obama administration may also provide benefits to immigrant agricultural workers and to those who came to the U.S. as children, which would allow hundreds of thousands more to stay in the U.S.  Though that proposal is likely to be the most controversial part of Obama\\'s reportedly forthcoming executive actions, he also plans to clarify that immigrants who don\\'t have a significant history of committing crime and who have family in the U.S. should be low on the priority list for deportation. He would also build better work opportunities for immigrants with tech skills such as software engineering and reallocate more of America\\'s security workforce to the border with Mexico.  The president has wanted to pass some type of immigration reform for some time now. A reform bill passed in the Senate but died without a vote in the House of Representatives last year, and Obama does not seem to believe that another bill has a better shot at success. Instead, he seems to have decided to pressure the GOP with these executive actions, which Obama has said he would repeal if Congress puts a bill on his desk that he is willing to sign.  Why are Republican lawmakers so opposed?  House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, right, walks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, left, as they make their way to a GOP strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington on Nov. 19, 2013.Image: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressRepublican lawmakers want a say in immigration reform, and they get no say in the president\\'s executive actions.  Many GOP lawmakers have cried out when Obama has gone through with other executive actions, but the idea of unilateral action on immigration reform has ignited an even sharper strain of vitriol, because Republicans and Democrats have very different ideas about how to improve the immigration system.  If Obama acts by himself, he would remove Republicans from the debate, forcing them to either come up with a bill that Obama would pass or making them hope for a GOP president in 2016 who can find a legal way to repeal Obama\\'s legislation.  What happens if Obama goes through with the executive actions?  In this Aug. 9 photo, President Barack Obama speaks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington.Image: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated PressNo one is sure what will happen, but some powerful Republicans have issued specific threats that they may or may not carry out should Obama go it alone.  House Speaker John Boehner said Obama would be \"playing with fire\" by enacting immigration reform. And soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said if Obama doesn\\'t involve the GOP, it would be like \"waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" Most Republicans are threatening their level of cooperation for the long term. They say that if Obama doesn\\'t involve them in the immigration debate, then he can forget about any bipartisanship for the rest of his time as president.  More specifically, Boehner and other Republicans are considering another government shutdown if they don\\'t get their way. Congress must pass a government funding bill by Dec. 11, and some want to include language within the bill that would block spending for Obama\\'s immigration proposals.  If Obama refuses to sign it, the government would shut down until a bill was passed. Though Boehner has left that option open, the Kentucky Republican, McConnell, has said several times that he opposes a shutdown.  Boehner is thinking of suing Obama over these potential executive actions, something he has done before, and some of the more right-wing conservatives have even brought up the possibility of impeachment. More likely than impeachment, though, is that Republicans will probably fight much harder against the confirmation of Loretta Lynch, the president\\'s nominee for attorney general Whether any of those specific actions are taken is unclear, but you can bet on Republicans contesting any Obama-enacted immigration laws in 2015, when they control both houses of Congress. They may, for example, try to pass counter-laws that would strip immigration agencies of the cash they need to carry out Obama\\'s plans.  What happens if Obama doesn\\'t do it?  President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, on Nov. 5, in Washington. Image: Evan Vucci/Associated PressDon\\'t expect a rousing rendition of Kumbaya from the nation\\'s capital, but Republicans would theoretically be more open to bipartisanship if Obama holds off. Boehner has said that there is no chance of immigration reform if the president does it by himself, which means the GOP might be willing to consider some kind of reform if Obama passes the ball to Congress.  Without an Obama action, reform is certain to take longer, if it happens at all. Another delay may further anger some Hispanic voters, too, and those ballots are key for Democrats in any election. Many of them remember all too well Obama\\'s many promises to change the system, but they have yet to see much action. That said, signs point to action before the end of 2014, meaning the year is likely to go out in a roar, or at least in a lot of yelling and finger-pointing.  ',\n",

       " ' LOS ANGELES — Disney announced Fantasia: Music Evolved for the Xbox  earlier this month, based on the studio\\'s classic movie. In the game, you play as the sorcerer’s apprentice (the role portrayed by Mickey in the film) and control the music on the screen, similar to the way the ironic mouse did it in the film. I had the opportunity to give the game a spin at Disney’s E3 booth this week, and walked away impressed. Move to the Music  Admittedly, I’m a huge fan of most of the music and moving games out there. Rock Band? I\\'ll school you on every instrument. Let’s Dance? No problem. A game like Fantasia is right up my alley, particularly because it combines games, music and moving to create an interactive experience. SEE ALSO: 10 Best Cross-Platform Multiplayer Mobile Games  There’s no controller for the game. Everything is handled through the Kinect sensor on the Xbox One or Xbox 360. The sensor on the system I tried had a bit of trouble seeing me at first, and intermittent problems registering my movements within the game. But since it’s both a game and platform in progress, I’ll give the issue a pass for the time being. Magical World   Disney\\'s Fantastia        Enhance the Shoal As you play, the shoal gets more colorful, and more musical.          Move to the Music Lights appear on the screen, indicating where you need to swipe.          Challenges This cube is one of the challenges in the game. Get every move right, and you can move on to the bonus round.          Musical Turtles The back of this turtle has a drum set on it.          Musical Crab Ever rock out with a crab?          Portal to Tunes The black hole at the bottom left of the screen will take you to a full playable song.       The game starts in an underwater cove, where everything is gray, including the dim tones you hear coming from it. Songs are hidden within the cove as small portals. During an on-stage demo, someone performed Bohemian Rhapsody. For my demo, I gave \"Some Nights\" by Fun. a try.  Once you enter a portal — by placing two hands in front of you, over the black hole in the cove — you’re transported to space, where your song is about to begin.  Much like Rock Band or similar games, playing requires you to make movements with the music, which are marked on the screen. These movements are mostly swipes and outward palm presses, while moves are timed along with the music and each one earns you points. Occasionally, you’ll be given a challenge in the form of a prism or square, with a number of exact movements needed in quick succession. Finish them all correctly, and you’ll be taken to a special freestyle section of the game where you manipulate the music to create your own special mix. Mix It Up  Unlike other games, you can’t really lose in Fantastia. Depending on how well you play, you’ll be given more and better opportunities to customize the tunes, but you’ll never be kicked out of a song for underperforming. As you play, there are a few options for customizing the song you’re hearing to your own personal taste. Several times in each song you are given three choices — such as vocals, drums, and guitar — and you are asked to swipe toward the option you’d like to hear more of. The result is a version of the song unique to you, and one that potentially could change each time you play. When you’re done, selections from your mix go back out into the cove with you and add actual color to the area. Clips from your mix of the song are also now incorporated into the mix playing in the outside world. Blowfish were singing part of “Some Nights” as they swam by. Once it has a little color, you can also interact with things in the cove. For instance, a turtle swimming by had a drum set on its back made of shells where I could tap out a tune.  Lots of Promise For a game still in progress — there will ultimately be 25 tracks available to play — Harmonix and Disney have made a solid start. I\\'ll likely buy Fantasia: Music Evolved when it hits stores in 2014.  What do you think? Could you see yourself playing the game? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

       " ' Analysts say that for-profit companies might now decline to offer any type of birth control as part of their insurance coverage, after the Supreme Court ruled on Monday to protect the religious liberties of qualifying private corporations.  The decision was a victory for Hobby Lobby, the arts-and-crafts chain that objected to covering four types of contraception on religious grounds. The business, which operates more than 500 stores nationwide, had until then been required by the Affordable Care Act to provide no-cost coverage of 20 different types of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. If the company refused, it would have been charged a daily fine of up to $1.3 million. The religious owners of Hobby Lobby, David and Barbara Green, said they could not in good conscience pay for any of their 16,000 full-time employees to receive two types of emergency contraception or two types of intrauterine devices (IUDs), which they considered tantamount to abortion. The Supreme Court, which did not evaluate the scientific validity of the Greens’ claims, narrowly sided with the couple and their fellow plaintiffs in a 5-4 decision.  See also: 7 Ways Companies Are Using the Government\\'s Open Data Though the case only considered the objections of a few companies over four types of birth control, analysts and advocates say other employers with religious objections to the contraception mandate could use the ruling to immediately decline coverage of all approved birth control methods, which include diaphragms, hormone pills and injections, and sterilization. The decision does not impact publicly traded companies.  Michael A. Helfand, associate professor of law at Pepperdine University, told Mashable that companies hoping to claim an exemption need only argue that they are “closely held” and that their opposition is based on religious belief. But the term “closely held” can be misleading; the Supreme Court described it as owned and controlled by members of a single family. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out in a scathing dissent, however, this distinction belongs not only to smaller firms, but also to behemoth-sized companies, such as candy maker Mars Inc. and agricultural company Cargill Inc. “The five justices are basically saying the personal views of a CEO trump the rights of all the women who work for him,” said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which vocally opposes the decision. “It’s a very dangerous precedent and quite open-ended.” Emily Hardman, a spokeswoman for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington public interest law firm that argued the Hobby Lobby case, told Mashable the company will not deny its employees coverage for the 16 other types of FDA-approved birth control. “The Greens have no moral objections to traditional forms of contraception and will continue to provide that in their generous health care package,” Hardman wrote in an email.  Margot Riphagen of New Orleans wore a birth control costume as she protested in front of the Supreme Court on March 25 as the court heard oral arguments in the Hobby Lobby case. Image: Charles Dharapak/Associated PressBut other employers feel differently. More than 40 private companies have filed suits protesting the contraception mandate, including some that don’t want to provide any type of birth control at all. It’s not clear how many closely held U.S. companies could claim a religious exemption, but according to Mother Jones, among the firms that have filed suit are construction, law, automotive and medical device businesses. Julianna Gonen, director of government relations for New York City-based nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights, which supports birth control coverage, said that these plaintiffs would likely be “encouraged” by the ruling, because the Supreme Court didn’t clearly state that it applies only to the four types of birth control at issue.  “It’s hard to know why they drew the line here today, and why it wouldn’t move,” she said.  Helfand said the court didn’t explain how the existing cases might be resolved. One option, he said, was that a “company could just assume they fall under the [Supreme Court] decision, and if they get it wrong, there could be consequences down the road.” Though the Supreme Court allowed companies the right to decline coverage, it said it did not intend to strip female employees of the federally guaranteed right to access no-cost birth control. Instead, Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the majority opinion, suggested the federal government find another way to provide the service to women whose employers won’t offer the benefit. This could be through the same exemption designed for nonprofit religious organizations, which rely on their insurance companies to pay for the cost of birth control.  “[The Department of Health and Human Services] has provided no reason why the same system cannot be made available when the owners of for-profit corporations have similar religious objections,” Alito wrote. “We therefore conclude that this system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.”  Being opposed to chemical abortions is not the same as being opposed to all contraception. #HobbyLobby pic.twitter.com/X7EXjWdIBw — CWA LAC (@CWforA) June 30, 2014   Just saying. RT @LEBassett: Hobby Lobby still covers vasectomies and viagra, btw. http://t.co/v4gbbj4MQ5 — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) June 30, 2014  Women’s health advocates said the court’s suggestion was not an acceptable alternative. Richards, of Planned Parenthood, said it left women who are trying to obtain birth control recommended by their doctors to “fend for themselves.” She said her organization was working with members of Congress to remedy the gap in coverage, and added, “Why should the women have the burden?” Justice Ginsburg made a similar argument in her dissent, noting that IUDs are significantly more effective — and more expensive — than other forms of birth control. These implantable devices, which remain effective for years, are “nearly equivalent to a month\\'s full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage,” Ginsburg wrote. She cited studies showing that almost one-third of women would change their birth control method if cost was not a factor, and that only a quarter of women who want an IUD have one inserted after learning the price. Ginsburg predicted in her dissent that the court’s ruling would have far-reaching implications. “And where is the stopping point to the ‘let the government pay’ alternative?” she wrote. “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according equal pay to women for substantially similar work?” “Justice Ginsburg had a long parade of horribles,” Helfand said, “and the majority opinion doesn’t tell us about how those cases would turn out.” Justice Anthony Kennedy, who joined the majority opinion, wrote that the “Court’s opinion does not have the breadth and sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful dissent.” While that remains to be seen, Helfand said the case raised profound questions about protecting fundamental rights. “When it’s the case that the health needs of women are pitted against religious liberty, these are extremely tragic choices the law needs to make,” he said. “The idea we have to choose is deeply unfortunate.”        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' You may remember Google\\'s mystery barges: two four-story floating structures uncovered simultaneously this time last year by enterprising reporters in San Francisco and Portland, Maine.  The barges turned out to be showcases for Google products such as Project Glass. That wasn\\'t as exciting as other potential uses, such as seabound server farms, so we continued to call them mystery barges regardless — perhaps in the hope that the quirky tech giant would come up with another use case. See also: Google and Others Sink $542 Million Into Mystery Virtual Reality Venture The Bay Area barge was moved to an out-of-the-way town in February; the Maine barge was sold for scrap in August. The only mystery that remained was why they were taken out of action. All the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission would say about the west coast barge was that it didn\\'t have its paperwork in order. The plot thickened. Now, thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Wall Street Journal, we have our answer: The Coast Guard had essentially declared the barges to be fire hazards.  \"These vessels will have over 5,000 gallons of fuel on the main deck and a substantial amount of combustible material on board,\" a Coast Guard official pointed out to Google\\'s contractor in a March 2013 email, according to the WSJ.  By September 2013, apparently, Google still hadn\\'t figured out a way to deal with that fire hazard adequately. The guard\\'s inspector wrote that there were not enough safety measures to deal with the specter of visitors — Google estimated there would be 1,200 of them each day — having to jump overboard.  That doesn\\'t necessarily mean the company didn\\'t have enough life rafts and floatation devices. It\\'s also that the Coast Guard didn\\'t see any plans to limit the number of people on board, or shepherd visitors with disabilities to safety.  See also: Google is going after tumors with nanoparticles With these urgent safety concerns still unaddressed several months later, the barge project was actually halted in early October 2013 — weeks before those reporters revealed their existence to the world. But you wouldn\\'t know that from the statement Google released to the media in November, which only suggested that the project was in its \"early days\". You also wouldn\\'t know it from the Coast Guard, which had signed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Google — a typical gagging device in Silicon Valley, less typical in an agency concerned with public safety. Indeed, Coast Guard officials complained about the NDA after it was hit with media requests, the emails reveal.  Let\\'s hope Google can put its next seabound project on an even keel.  ',\n",

See also: VW\\'s Super Bowl Ad Is Here and It\\'s Wacky In the video, released Tuesday on YouTube, Morpheus — playing the most intense valet attendee ever — asks a couple to make a life-changing decision.  \"Take the blue key and go back to the luxury you know,\" Morpheus says, recalling the iconic red/blue pill movie scene. \"You take the red key and you\\'ll never look at luxury the same again.\"  The couple, of course, takes the red key and gets a look at Kia\\'s K900 car. Morpheus then serenades them with an impressive cover of the aria from Puccini\\'s Turandot while the world implodes around them. The ad\\'s use of The Matrix is a smart move, considering the movie asks its protagonist Neo to reconsider his reality — and Kia is now asking people to literally reconsider the brand\\'s image.

       " ' Google CEO Larry Page delivered a highly unusual appearance on Wednesday during the company\\'s I/O conference in which he delivered an impassioned speech discussing the competition, the importance of technology and programming\\'s \"image problem\" and took questions from the audience. Page, who spoke softly as the result of a medical condition he discussed with the press earlier this week, got a huge round of applause upon his entrance. He then segued into a monologue in which he discussed how his father made tech a priority for his son\\'s education. \"My dad was really interested in technology. He drove me and my family all across the country to go to a robotics company. Then we got there, he thought it was so important his son would go to the conference.\" The talk continued in that vein as Page discussed the competitive thinking that he says stifles innovation and collaboration. \"When I read about us in the press, it\\'s always us vs. some other company or some stupid thing,\" Page said. \"I just don\\'t find that interesting.\" Page added that \"most important things are not a zero-sum game. There\\'s a lot of opportunity out there.\"  He added that Microsoft\\'s recent decision to include Google Talk functionality in Outlook made him \"personally quite sad\" since the interoperability only goes one way. (Outlook doesn\\'t offer interoperablity with Gmail.) \"It\\'s been sad that the industry is focused on negative, zero-sum games,\" Page said. During the Q&A session, Page also dismissed Oracle as being too combative. \"Money is more important to them than having collaboration,\" Page said.  Page also addressed the company\\'s role in the upcoming Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson film The Internship as a deliberate choice. \"They were making a movie we decided we\\'d get involved,\" he said, explaining that computer science has an image problem in which techies are seen as \"nerdy curmudgeons.\" However in The Internship, a tech-savvy Google employee character is \"by far the coolest character in the movie.\"  Image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' A store in Australia made headlines earlier this year for charging consumers $5 to just walk through the door. The decision was made following the growth of \"showrooming,\" a familiar concept when a person heads into a physical store to check out merchandise before finding the same product at a cheaper price online. Thanks to free shipping and returns, as well as low or no taxes — hello, Amazon — it makes sense for consumers to do online price comparisons before making a purchase. According to analytics firm ForeSee Results, about 70% of consumers use a mobile phone in a retail store to research and accompany their shopping experiences. Data from U.K.-based design agency Foolproof also supports the growth of in-store mobile usage. In fact, a recent report revealed 24% of British consumers \"showroomed\" during the 2012 holiday shopping season — and 40% of that number bought from a competitor after comparing prices. Not surprisingly, retailers with brick-and-mortar locations are struggling with the concept and are under pressure to entice people to make purchases while inside the store. \"Brands and companies such as Best Buy, Target, Walmart and other large national and global retail brands are taking it very seriously,\" says Brian Gillespie, principal at service design firm Continuum. \"It has pushed them to innovate their cross-channel marketing strategies and in turn, it has spawned a slew of new digital marketing services that are engaging shoppers in new ways and enticing them to stores.\" SEE ALSO: Is Native Advertising Just Another Term for \\'Good Advertising\\'? For example, Target earlier this year announced plans to price-match online competitors, such as Amazon. According to Jack Philbin, co-founder and CEO of mobile marketing solutions company Vibes, the mobile wallet space is impacting showrooming. This is helped along by the launch of Apple Passbook and Google Wallet, and other location-based marketing services. \"When you have a \\'Pass\\' in Passbook, it\\'s another valuable way marketers can connect beyond showrooming because as consumers walk past a store, an alert message appears on their phones telling them a location is nearby where they can use their passes,\" Philbin said. \"Google announced this week it is developing a mobile wallet solution that will allow consumers to save objects to Google Wallet, such as loyalty cards, offers, tickets, boarding passes and more, and this will be valuable to consumers and retailers, as well.\" So is showrooming a bad thing? \"Overall, it\\'s neither good nor bad, depending on whether you view it as the death of physical retail or a kick to traditional retailers to innovate their cross-channel experience,\" Gillespie of Continuum says. \"Those who are tackling it head-on may actually consider showrooming the future of retail.\" The Economist reporter Matthew Bishop recently noted how the success of online companies such as Warby Parker, which made a name for itself with its virtual eyeglass try-on features, is encouraging expansion beyond the web. Warby Parker recently opened its first brick-and-mortar location in New York City. SEE ALSO: Here\\'s Why You Should Never Set Out to Go Viral \"Showrooming is forcing companies to figure out ways to take advantage of the opportunities it provides,\" Gillespie added. \"Those who fear it will fail, while those who embrace it and use it to their advantage will succeed.\" At the same time, there is also the opposite of showrooming, which Gillepsie refers to as \"webrooming\" or \"e-rooming.\" Shoppers search for the products they want online, and then head into the store to make a purchase. \"For this to work, it puts a huge onus on the stores to create an excellent in-store experience. Innovative retailers such as Nordstrom and Burberry already get this, and those retailers who succeed will bring out the best the best qualities of physical stores such as customer service to their digital environments.\" Image via Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Rachel Roy ',\n",

       " ' MLB pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered a horrific injury last season when he was nailed in the head with a line drive.  McCarthy somehow avoided longterm major damage and is back playing this season, but an MLB Network commentator brought the scary moment up again on Wednesday in decidedly indelicate fashion.  We\\'ll let @HeardOnMLBT, a Twitter account poking fun at the often inane things said on MLB Network, take it from here:  \"If you don\\'t pitch in, this is what\\'s gonna happen.\" - Mitch Williams, during a clip of @BMcCarthy32\\'s injury last year. — Heard on MLB Tonight (@HeardOnMLBT) July 11, 2013  For the uninitiated, here\\'s the point Williams (himself a former Big League pitcher) was trying to make: Pitchers should aim for the inside part of the strike zone — that is, closer to the batter\\'s body — to be effective and keep offensive players on guard. To assign McCarthy blame for a freak play that legitimately could have killed him, however, is ignorant at best and downright offensive at worst.   McCarthy, not surprisingly, took exception to Williams\\' line of thought, posting this on Twitter early Thursday:  .@WildThingMLBN I hope the clip of me nearly dying helped you make one of your asinine points. — Brandon McCarthy (@BMcCarthy32) July 11, 2013  But that was just the beginning. McCarthy then posted a series of follow-up tweets mocking Williams\\' reasoning. Before long, many of his 118,000 followers had joined in on the party, creating a mini-meme of their own:  \"If you go to autotrader dot com this is what\\'s gonna happen\"- Mitch Williams, talking over a clip of an 8 car pileup — Brandon McCarthy (@BMcCarthy32) July 11, 2013   \"If you teach your child to throw a football, this is what will happen\"- Mitch Williams, over a clip of Tom Brady\\'s knee injury — Brandon McCarthy (@BMcCarthy32) July 11, 2013   @BMcCarthy32 \"If you sit down on a toilet, this is what happens.\" - Mitch Williams. pic.twitter.com/vVJs4K0TGN — AJ Jones (@justplainaj) July 11, 2013   @BMcCarthy32 \"If you fail out of art school this is what happens\" -Mitch Williams on the Third Reich — Ryan M (@Bulbastroyed43) July 11, 2013   @BMcCarthy32 \"If you make a movie, this is what\\'s going to happen.\" - Mitch Williams on \"Gigli\" — Passwaters (@Passwaters_78) July 11, 2013   @BMcCarthy32 \"If you\\'re gonna be a rock band, this is what\\'s going to happen\" - Mitch Williams on Nickleback — Christian Allen (@ChristianAllen1) July 11, 2013   @BMcCarthy32 \"If you stay up til 3 am this is what\\'s going to happen\" -Mitch Williams watching me try to think of a good Mitch Williams joke — Tyler Jones (@tyjo1710) July 11, 2013  And justice was served, Twitter-style.

       " ' Cue record needle scratch: Urban Outfitters is not, in fact, the biggest seller of vinyl records in the world. Last week, Urban Outfitters\\' chief administrative officer announced, off-handedly, that the company was leading the pack in vinyl sales. This prompted Billboard to look further into this claim. Billboard  surveyed 80% of the U.S. music market (labels, distributors, and wholesalers) and determined that Urban Outfitters is actually second to Amazon as largest retailer of vinyl records.  According to Billboard, Urban Outfitters accounts for 8.1% of the market share, whereas Amazon sits well above at 12.3%.  Maybe the most important finding here, though, is that Hot Topic ranks in the top five retailers of vinyl at 2.4%. The headline has been change to reflect this news development. The original post appears below:  If you\\'re looking for proof that vinyl is here to stay, consider this: Urban Outfitters is now the biggest seller of vinyl records in the world.

And a big chunk of that is thanks to Urban Outfitters  — the retail \"hipster\" mecca which caters to a 18- to 28-year-old demographic and is quick to capitalize on any and all rising millennial trends. (Also, national tragedies, but we\\'ll try to put that behind us) Last year, sales of vinyl LPs hit 6.1 million albums, the highest since 1991. This year, Nielsen SoundScan projects numbers that will top that.  Before you locate the nearest high-up mountain top and scream that music is dead from it, let\\'s put this phenomenon to scale: In 2012, 64% of vinyl sales were coming from independent record stores. As for vinyl-carrying chains, competition continues to be slim in 2014.  Urban Outfitters has yet to release an official report with numbers on vinyl sales. But we\\'re hoping those numbers somewhere include stats on how many shoppers age 18-28 are buying Radiohead vinyl exclusively to hang on their bedroom walls.

See also: 4 Months and 3 Million Comments Later, the Public Has Spoken on Net Neutrality The nationwide effort, which included protests at the White House, Comcast headquarters in Philadelphia and Union Square in New York City, was orchestrated by a nonprofit advocacy group called Fight For the Future.   In San Francisco, a group of around 50 activists carrying phone flashlights and candles congregated near Civic Center on Thursday night  for a symbolic vigil for an open Internet. The protest lasted for about an hour, during which speakers addressed the gathered crowd and led chants directed at FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and President Barack Obama.  The demonstrations were in response to reporting by the Wall Street Journal that revealed through sources close to the FCC that the agency is close to reaching a new proposal on net neutrality.  The plan would subject ISPs to more regulation but also leave them the power to make deals that give certain online companies faster service than others, so long as the FCC deems that the deals do not hurt competition in the industry.  Proponents of net neutrality often argue that the FCC should reclassify ISPs as common carriers — a designation similar to public utilities — rather than information services. The move would give the agency more regulatory authority to prevent deals between ISPs, like cable and cell phone companies, and content services, such as Netflix or Hulu, that would charge companies for bandwidth.  ‘Emergency’ protests sweep US to save internet from ‘hybrid’ net neutrality http://t.co/GvPCmOpAJp #InternetEmergency pic.twitter.com/F6FNCz2k9f — th anonymous (@ori_no_co) November 7, 2014  The new proposal would divide the Internet into so-called \"retail\" and \"back-end\" sides. The back-end side would include dealings between ISPs and content companies, and in this sense, ISPs would be regulated as common carriers. Retail would include business between consumers and ISPs and fall under information services. Kit Walsh, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation who attended the protest in San Francisco, said this plan is not an adequate compromise. He added that he doubts it will stand up legally, since ISPs are very likely to challenge it in court.   While the proposal has not yet been finalized or released to the public, Walsh said, activists need to make their voice heard as soon as possible in order to have the most impact on the process.  \"The most critical time to take action is now, before any proposed rules come out so we can correct the course,\" he said.  #InternetEmergency #SanFrancisco Vigil tonight starts 6pm at Civic Center - Bring your light to help the cause!! pic.twitter.com/W28QUzxO9e — Stay Well Map (@StayWellMap) November 7, 2014  When the FCC asked for public input on a proposed rule change that would lock in net neutrality earlier this year, a record-setting 3.7 million comments flooded in over the four-month window. The sheer volume of opinions — the overwhelming majority of which argued in favor of regulating to keep the Internet open  — proved that citizens are willing to turn out when the future of the Internet is potentially at stake. Many worry that if net neutrality is not protected, it will stymie innovation by making it more expensive for small startups to reach a wide audience online. Ryan Farrell, a software developer who lives in San Francisco, said less protection of net neutrality would result in more barriers to entry for small tech companies. \"It makes it really difficult for small companies to get their foot in the door, whether it\\'s service providers or online companies,\" Farrell said. \"I\\'m just afraid we\\'re going to start seeing voices disappear from the internet.\"  Kevin Huang, the campaign manager who helped coordinate the protests across the country, said that for many of the protesters, net neutrality is a matter of free speech and accessibility. \"It\\'s a crisis that the internet is going through right now, and it\\'s really scary because if the FCC moves forward in the way that it\\'s going, we could wake up one day, and the internet won\\'t be as accessible as it was before,\" Huang said. Still, the \"limited half measure\" is better than nothing, Walsh said, since it does subject ISPs to more regulation than they would otherwise face.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' The Department of Education on Thursday\\xa0released a list of 55 colleges and universities under investigation for potential mishandling of sexual assault cases in violation of Title IX, a group that includes all manner of schools including Harvard, Berkeley and the University of Southern California. No school is presumed guilty of any violation at this time, and a department spokesman told Mashable that no specifics of the probes will be released until they are complete.\\xa0The department\\xa0statement\\xa0did say that if someone requests information about a particular school, it will disclose whether it found the need for a \"resolution\" phase with that institution. See also: White House Rolls Out Guidelines to Stop Sexual Assault With Star-Studded PSA \"No one probably loves to have their name on that list,\" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said during a White House press conference, according to the\\xa0Associated Press. \"But we\\'ll investigate; we\\'ll go where the facts are. And where they have done everything perfectly, we\\'ll be very loud and clear that they\\'ve done everything perfectly.\" The list of universities and colleges is full of schools both public and private, large and small. It includes Arizona State University, the College of William and Mary, Catholic University of America, Knox College, Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard College and Harvard Law, Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon University and many more. The AP said some probes began after someone complained about that college or university directly to the Department of Education. Other investigations launched after news stories incited concern about a particular school\\'s handling of sexual assault cases. That\\'s likely a major part of the reason Dartmouth College is on the list:\\xa0The Department of Education began investigating that school in May, 2013 for potentially violating the Clery Act, which requires universities and colleges to record a list of sexual assault crimes that occur on and around campus and enact policies to help prevent them. In March, a petition to force Dartmouth to enact stricter punishments for students who commit sexual violence garnered over 50,000 signatures. The petition started after a student there was sexually assaulted when her name was mentioned in a \"rape guide\" written on a website often visited by Dartmouth students. The University of North Carolina, Swarthmore College, the University of Virginia, Occidental College, Amherst College, Wesleyan University, the University of California, Berkley and Yale University all made news for similar reasons over the past two years, and all but Yale and Wesleyan are on the newly released list, the full version of which you can see below. Yale was fined $165,000 for Clery Act violations in May, 2013. The department plans to update the list of schools \"regularly,\" but the updated list won\\'t be available to the public except by request. The government can refuse federal funding to a college or university that is found to have violated Title IX, but it has not exacted that power so far, choosing instead to develop voluntary resolutions with the schools.

       " ' Twitter updated its iOS and Android apps Tuesday with new search filters and an enhanced focus on conversations around TV. Under the \"Discover\" tab, Twitter now collates trending television shows based on a user\\'s area, in addition to trending topics and hashtags. To access trending TV shows, users can simply browse through the list to pull up trends related to TV shows and local content. See also: The Complete Guide to Twitter Lingo The trending television shows are organized by popularity and/or when the show will air next. On Tuesday night, for example, The Voice was the top trending show until it stopped airing at 10 p.m. local time. Meanwhile, late-night shows such as The Daily Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live and Late Night With Jimmy Fallon showed up closer to their respective air times. Interestingly, Good Morning America, which doesn\\'t air until 7 a.m. ET, was the top-listed show as of 11 p.m. ET. This may indicate that networks or shows can pay for better placement, or it might just be the result of Twitter\\'s internal TV algorithms. When you click on a trending TV show, a collection of tweets around the show appears, just as it would for a trending topic or hashtag. Unlike a pure hashtag, however, trending TV shows aggregate conversations about a show across hashtags and conversations. For NBC\\'s Chicago Fire, for instance, tweets mentioning \"Chicago Fire,\" @NBCChicagoFire and #ChicagoFire all appeared.  Twitter first started testing a \"trending TV\" feature in August. The company has increased its focus on social TV and conversations around television in the last year. In February, Twitter acquired social-TV analytics startup Bluefin Labs. According to the Twitter\\'s S-1 filing before its IPO, Bluefin Labs was its most expensive acquisition. Nielsen\\'s Twitter TV ratings, which quantifies the number of users who post and view tweets about specific TV shows, debuted last month.  Industry studies have repeatedly indicated that increased Twitter conversation leads to higher television ratings.  As a public company, Twitter is hoping to leverage that power into advertising buys by brands, networks and the shows themselves. Sources close to Twitter told us that Tuesday\\'s \"Trending TV\" update is just the start of more TV-focused Twitter features. The company plans to do more to help users discover and discuss TV shows, with a focus on live events. Images: Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images; Mashable, Twitter for iPhone ',\n",
       " ' There are two kinds of people in the world. You\\'ve probably heard that. There are introverts and extroverts, planners and improvisers, marshmallow eaters and marshmallow savers, women (Venus) and men (Mars), right-brained people and left-brained people (or maybe not). Now there\\'s yet another way to divide the human race in half: by how we organize time. There are \"clock-time\" people and \"event-time\" people, according to research by two marketing professors. Clock-timers, as the term suggests, schedule their days by hours and minutes. They give tasks, errands and even pastimes an allotted hour and a time limit, and they stick to the schedule. Event-timers, on the other hand, schedule serially: They work on a task until it\\'s finished or they reach a natural stopping point, and then they move on to something else. Some of the difference, the researchers say, is contextual, some of it is cultural and some may be genetic. The professors, Anne-Laure Sellier of NYU\\'s Stern School of Business and Tamar Avnet of Yeshiva University\\'s Syms School of Business, have published a series of papers that lay out the ramifications of this seemingly minor variation. The latest paper is forthcoming from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In it, they argue that event-timers are better able to savor experiences, and are therefore happier than clock-timers. In one online experiment, they asked subjects about a set of scenarios to see how much they savored them: finishing an important task, getting a promotion, spending a romantic weekend away. Then the subjects were given a questionnaire about how they scheduled tasks. The clock-timers were worse savorers than the event-timers, they found.SEE ALSO: Grades Don\\'t Matter Much If You\\'re Using Your MBA to Advance Neurosurgery Sellier and Avnet argue that it comes down to a sense of control. Because clock-timers are ruled by the march of the hours, they feel less control over their lives than event-timers, whose schedules are in their own hands. In a study designed by Sellier, subjects underwent a session of hot yoga, a fitness routine that exacerbates the discomfort of normal yoga by setting the poses in sauna-like conditions. The subjects were yoga neophytes. (One was excluded from the data set because he had to leave early to vomit, having eaten \"a heavy meal shortly before the session.\") They were primed to think in either clock time or event time, both by the instructor and by the room\\'s decor. For the subjects they wanted to be thinking in clock time, researchers had instructors announce how long each pose would be held, and there was — you guessed it — a clock on the wall. For the event-time group, the instructor simply announced the poses, and the clock was obscured. Afterward, the event-time-primed subjects reported feeling more control over how they had done than the clock-timed ones, and they also performed better. They were better at performing the poses than were the clock timers, holding them longer and giving up less frequently.SEE ALSO: Fixing the Best Schools in the World In a yet-unpublished paper, the two researchers have found evidence that thinking in terms of clock time stifles creativity. When this research comes out, we\\'ll have a better sense of how big an effect Sellier and Avnet have found. They are already believers. They each have two children and have used the findings in their households. Avnet\\'s 10-year-old son, she says, is \"very clock-time.\" On weekends, she tries to push him into more of an event-time mindset. \"I take away the clocks and I do not allow him to see what time it is,\" she says. \"I\\'ll ask him, \\'Do you want lunch?\\' and he\\'ll say, \\'What time is it?\\' And I\\'ll say, \\'It has nothing to do with what time it is; do you want to have lunch?\\'\"  Bank of England Rejected the Idea to Create a Database of Bad Bankers Bloomberg Brief Weekly Video 10/20 Mexico Peso Trades in Line With Peers After Presidential Debate Snoopy, Loved as Friend, Lacking as Leader, Gets Boot at MetLife   This article originally published at Bloomberg here  ',\n",
       " ' Jawbone is introducing two new fitness activity trackers, including its next-generation UP3 wristband wearable that will one day know when you\\'re dehydrated, stressed and fatigued. Sleek in design and significantly smaller than its previous UP24 model — check out the picture above for the difference in size — the UP3 ($179) comes with advanced activity features that can differentiate exercises, such as swimming, running and tennis, to better gauge calories. It also includes sleep tracking, which can signify REM, light and deep sleep See also: 14 Hot Fitness Gadgets to Make You Sweat Unlike many newer fitness tracker models, Jawbone decided not to incorporate a display or smartwatch-like notification features that are popping up on competitors such as the Fitbit Charge HR and the Microsoft Band. Instead, you can tap the top of the device to see lights that indicate how close you are to your daily goal. More data is displayed on the corresponding app.  \"Many people don\\'t want to wear a device with a screen that lights up when they get a call or message — and if they do, they know they can get a smartwatch,\" a Jawbone spokesperson told Mashable. \"We believe that fitness trackers should be discreet, not interrupt your day and shouldn\\'t be a clunky piece of cheap plastic, and that is what we\\'re up against in the market.\"  By keeping the device display-free, the Jawbone UP3 remains sleek and looks more like a piece of jewelry than a mini-computer wrapped around the wrist.  \"There are some beautiful smartwatches coming out soon — and Jawbone software will be a part of it — but we still believe there is a place for a fitness-focused wearable, too,\" the spokesperson said. The device has a watch-style clasp that adjusts the size of the band and holds it in place. The battery life is pretty solid too, promising up to seven days of tracking in one charge. The UP3 can also be dunked in water up to 10 meters deep.   Image:  Mashable,  Samantha Murphy KellyThe UP app software is getting a refresh too: Whether you purchase a new model or use an existing one, a new feature called Smart Coach gives personalized guidance to reach your goals. The more data the device collects (sleep, steps taken, meals and so on), the more tailored the suggestions will be. The UP3 also monitors your resting heart rate first thing every morning. By eating better and staying active, you can see if your heart rate count goes down — an indication of how healthy your heart is, before daily stresses and caffeine kick in and bump it up a few notches. Eventually, the UP3 is expected to offer continuous heart-rate tracking — the technology to do so is already baked in, but will be pushed out in an app update in the future.  Image:  Mashable,  Samantha Murphy KellyAlong these lines, perhaps the neatest part of UP3 is what is yet to come: It is set to eventually tell you when you\\'re dehydrated, fatigued or even stressed. Those features will be powered by built-in bioimpedance and skin/ambient temperature sensors. Bioimpedence sensors measure your body\\'s composition and provide a more complete understanding of your health. Although Jawbone didn\\'t say when a software update will be available— the timeline is for \"later this year\" —it\\'s already in the works. We\\'re assuming it will be right in time for the holiday shopping season.  The UP3 comes in three colors: black, red and silver.  Image:  Mashable,  Samantha Murphy KellyThe company also revealed the UP Move ($49.99), an activity tracker that can be clipped to clothing or snapped into a wristband-like accessory. The small gadget, equipped with tiny sensors, will track steps, calories and workouts, as well as your sleep cycle. It works with the UP App and can get tips and feedback from the Smart Coach, too.   The UP Move, which can last up to six months on one charge, is billed as a low-cost tracker for those who might be new to wearables. The UP Move will ship later this week. ',\n",

       " ' Local and state police in Ferguson have been banned from wearing \"I am Darren Wilson\" bracelets while on duty and in uniform. The prohibition, confirmed Friday in a Department of Justice letter, comes after a photo of a cop sporting the black band with white lettering on his wrist caught fire on social media and Ferguson residents complained about the bracelets.  Wilson is the white Ferguson police officer that killed unarmed black teenager Mike Brown, whose death sparked ongoing protests and criticism of police discrimination. Demonstrators adopted the phrase \"I am Mike Brown,\" early on, which, like \"I am Darren Wilson\" has been printed on merchandise. See also: Ferguson Police Chief\\'s Apology Was 6 Weeks Too Late for Protesters An official at DOJ, which launched a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson police department following the shooting, wrote in the letter to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, that the bracelets have \"upset and agitated\" Ferguson residents, who showed federal authorities pictures of police wearing them while policing protests earlier this week.  While the department appreciates self expression, the bracelets are adding fuel to a fire still burning in Ferguson, Christy Lopez, deputy chief of the civil rights division\\'s special litigation section said in the publicly released letter.   We are keenly aware of the importance of individual expression of opinions, even those that some find offensive, insensitive, or harmful. We also acknowledge that the message that many officers intend to convey by wearing these bracelets may be different than the message received by many of those who see these bracelets.  Nonetheless, there is no question that police departments can and should closely regulate officers\\' professional appearance and behavior, particularly where, as here, the expressive accessory itself is exacerbating an already tense atmosphere between law enforcement and residents in Ferguson. These bracelets reinforce the very \"us versus them\" mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exists.  Some of the officers who were photographed wearing the bracelets also blacked out their name plates with tapes, which is against Ferguson police policies. It\\'s unclear which police department the officers wearing the bracelets were from, Lopez said, adding that county and state law enforcement will also abide by the prohibition.  \"As you are all too aware, the actions of other police officers while in Ferguson can impact your community as much as the actions of your own officers,\" she said.

       " ' If you used Yahoo Messenger to video chat with your friends or strangers between 2008 and 2012 — and perhaps even later — British spies might have a collection of screenshots of your most intimate online conversations. The GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA, has been caught collecting screenshots of millions of Yahoo users from their webcams through a program called \"Optic Nerve,\" according to the latest Edward Snowden leak, published on Thursday. A large number of those images were, unsurprisingly, naked pictures taken from sexually explicit webcam sessions. How did this happen? And how worried should you be that something like this might happen again? See also: Is It the Dawn of the Encryption App? Unfortunately, the original report by The Guardian doesn\\'t provide much in the way of technical details, and the original documents the report is based on have not been released.  How It May Work First of all, it\\'s important to clarify that the GCHQ is not accused of hacking into computers and intercepting webcam feeds directly from the machines of Yahoo users, like hackers can by installing RAT (Remote Access Tool) malware on a victim\\'s laptop or PC. Furthermore, the GCHQ did not need Yahoo\\'s cooperation to execute its webcam spying project. The method the GCHQ reportedly used was to tap directly into fiber optic cables passing through the UK to collect one image of a Yahoo user using their webcams every five minutes, as part of its Project Tempora, according to The Guardian.  Thanks to this program, the GCHQ has reportedly been able to collect vast amounts of Internet data, without having to ask anyone for permission. As of this writing, it remains unclear as to just how many Yahoo users were simultaneously tracked by the GCHQ\\'s five-minute interval screenshot method.  Broader Implications Any Internet data flowing through those fiber optic cables, if not encrypted, can be intercepted in the same way. Yahoo\\'s webcam chat data, for example, is transmitted without encryption, making it relatively easy to be intercepted by GCHQ\\'s spies — as well as hackers snooping on public Wi-Fi networks like the ones commonly used at Starbucks.  That\\'s most likely how the British spies were able to collect screenshots of people using Yahoo Messenger, as privacy and security researcher Ashkan Soltani explained to Mashable. Yahoo told Mashable that it will begin encrypting Yahoo Messenger communications by March 31. However, the company declined to comment on the encryption of its webcam feeds.  What About Other Video Chat Services? But what if you use Google Hangouts, Apple Facetime or Skype? Google Hangouts Ever since its launch, Google Hangouts has used SSL web encryption, making video chats through the service theoretically safe from spy agencies tapping into fiber optic cables.  FaceTime As for Facetime, last summer Apple stated that \"conversations which take place over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption\" making them supposedly impossible to intercept, even for Apple.  A few months later, however, we found out that Apple\\'s claims regarding iMessage were not completely accurate, as researchers revealed that Apple and the NSA could theoretically read iMessages. Ever since Apple\\'s statement, however, no one has stepped forward to debunk or question FaceTime\\'s encryption techniques, so video conversations through the software should be safe. SkypeSkype, for its part, has long touted the security of its software. In 2008, a spokesperson said that, thanks to Skype\\'s encryption techniques, the company didn\\'t have the ability to help police intercept user calls through the software. But the same year, according to The New York Times, Skype secretly started working on \"Project Chess,\" an internal program designed to come up with ways to make Skype communications available to law enforcement agencies. Then, in 2011, the NSA forced Skype — at that point owned by Microsoft — to comply with its surveillance requests and become part of PRISM, according to Snowden documents. But PRISM is not the same thing as Tempora. Through PRISM, the NSA reportedly gets data directly from tech companies — with all the necessary legal requirements in place — rather from intercepted Internet traffic. Nevertheless, Skype, in an online FAQ, says its encryption \"protects you from potential eavesdropping by malicious users.\" What It All Means In summary, there is no indication that most other webcam chats are vulnerable to the same kind of surveillance the GCHQ reportedly used against Yahoo users. But if you\\'re using your webcam through Yahoo, you may be vulnerable.  Optic Nerve was still active in 2012, but there\\'s no indication the program has been stopped since then, as Spencer Ackerman, one of the two Guardian reporters who broke the story, noted on Twitter.  Just bc I\\'m seeing this out there: we have no indication OPTIC NERVE/etc *stopped* in 2012.

       " ' If you shopped at a Target store between Black Friday and Dec. 15 this year, there\\'s a good chance hackers accessed data from your credit or debit card account. The company confirmed on Thursday that a massive data breach affected all of its 40 million card devices at checkout stations across stores nationwide, starting on Nov. 27. The New York Times reported hackers may have compromised the software controlling point-of-sale systems, possibly via a phishing attack or inserting malware to gain access to credit card numbers, expiration dates and more. The hack could have been conducted with the help of an insider, the report said. Online shoppers were not affected.

If you shopped at a Target store in this designated time frame, you can call 866-852-8680. \"We are also answering questions on social media and trying to reach people anywhere they are engaged with the latest information,\" Snyder said. Keeping Data Safe The hackers did not perform a data dump online, which sometimes occurs during massive breaches. So as of now, no online tools are available to check whether specific accounts were affected. But you can still take other steps to keep your data secure.  According to password security firm LastPass, Target shoppers should not only monitor bank and various online accounts for suspicious activity, including email and social sites such as Facebook and Twitter, but also change their debit card PINs. \"If you used your debit card PIN code for anything else, change your debit card PIN and those other accounts immediately,\" LastPass spokesperson Amber Gott said. \"You should also consider getting your cards replaced if you know you shopped at Target during that time period.\" \"Also be on the lookout for emails sent from your account that you don\\'t recognize, auto-responders, posts that appear on your social networking profiles that you didn\\'t make and not being able to login with your existing passwords,\" Gott added. Shoppers can also sign up for a service that offers credit monitoring alerts, which performs daily checks for suspicious activity. ',\n",

       " ' The sequester, a series of federal budget cuts that went into effect in March, forced the FAA to cut employees\\' hours by approximately 10% — air traffic controllers included. That loss is already causing cascading delays originating in some of the country\\'s busiest airspace, including New York and Los Angeles. Indeed, the Federal Aviation Administration blames sequester-related furloughs for more than 1,200 of Monday\\'s flight delays — and the problem is only expected to get worse as the country enters peak travel season this summer. What\\'s a tech-savvy traveler to do? Adam Goldstein, CEO of travel booking service Hipmunk, told Mashable he\\'s heard tales of users who fall victim to airline delays pulling up alternate flight options on the Hipmunk mobile app to show airline gate agents in a bid to have their tickets rebooked. Additionally, should the worst happen — a flight that\\'s canceled or rescheduled for the next morning — Hipmunk users can book a nearby hotel on mobile, hopefully beating other passengers who are left to calling hotels in a desperate search for accommodations.  Goldstein added that the sequester-caused FAA furloughs have \"no doubt had an impact\" on air travel, but said they\\'re nothing like the disastrous effects a major snowstorm can have on travelers\\' plans.

       " ' Attention: The following tale involves alleged acts of vandalism and legal threats, an online campaign and one former NFL offensive lineman. It\\'s a remarkably strange story of partying, retribution and the role — legitimate or not — that the Internet can play in exacting retribution.  The drama begins with Brian Holloway, who played several seasons in the NFL, and owns a home in upstate Stephentown, New York.  See also: Happy Ending: Grandpa Returns to Fenway After Internet Pitches In Holloway went out of town over Labor Day weekend. When he came back, he said he found the house trashed. There was graffiti on the walls, garbage everywhere and what news outlets have pegged as $20,000 to $30,000 in all-around damage. More than 100 local teenagers reportedly had a huge party at Holloway\\'s home, breaking in while he was away, and absolutely wrecking the place.  What\\'s more, the alleged intruders and vandals had left a digital trail on social media, posting photos and declarations of drunkenness to Twitter.  The story started getting more national attention last week, after Holloway launched a website called HelpMeSave300.com. The site collected social-media posts allegedly made the night of the party, and seeks financial assistance to help refurbish the home. But most of all, Holloway cast it as an effort to save the lives of some 300 teenagers before they veer irreparably off course.  \"What is even more dangerous and shocking beyond the crimes, drugs and alcohol was reading the tweets and hearing them celebrate their destruction and documenting their crimes,\" Holloway writes on the site, which features imagery of a flat-lining heart monitor and wrecked vehicles.  The tale then took another bizarre turn when reports said some parents had threatened Holloway for his public campaign.  The site sparked a large — and mostly anonymous — online backlash against the teenagers, according to a Saturday article in the Times Union, an upstate New York-based newspaper. \"Bahaha. Watch some of these losers commit suicide now,\" reads one response, according to the paper. \"Your parents are lowlifes,\" reads another.  So, with the story gaining more and more attention, Holloway has been making the media rounds. He appeared on Fox News on Friday, where he gave a rather bizarre interview. In it, he proclaims \"I\\'m no hero,\" interrupts hosts\\' questions, acknowledges his grandchildren through the camera using some Ninja Turtles references and out of nowhere, accuses a neighbor of spousal abuse. Needless to say, the interview quickly goes off the rails:  But that\\'s not all. On Sunday, the following video appeared on YouTube with the title \"Don\\'t Bow Down! — The Interview that FOX Would NOT SHOW!!!\" It shows an unedited one-sided cut of the interview shot from the room where Holloway conducted it remotely, and is even weirder than the original:   Meanwhile, TMZ reported that Holloway\\'s house had been foreclosed upon well before the party that caused the alleged damage, and that he owed more than $1 million on it. Times Union columnist Chris Churchill wrote that some of the teenagers involved say Holloway\\'s 19-year-old son helped plan the party, that the level of damage \"has been wildly exaggerated\" and that some of the graffiti existed well before the party took place.  For now, there\\'s plenty of hearsay and little is certain, but it seems likely the story has more strange twists in store before the truth is revealed. Is Holloway entirely the victim, or is there more to his story than meets the eye?  No matter the ultimate outcome, the whole tale is a bizarre statement on justice in the digital age. We\\'ll continue to follow, and update as more develops.  Image: Brian Holloway Jr., YouTube ',\n",

       " ' Ron Garan knows a thing or two about orbital perspective. The NASA astronaut has traveled 71,075,867 miles in 2,842 orbits around the Earth and completed a six-month stay aboard the International Space Station.  But now he wants all Earth-dwelling humans to start thinking orbitally, too.  See also: 55 Astonishing Images of Earth From Space Garan will host a Google+ Hangout, titled \"The #KeyIsWe,\" to discuss ways individuals can collaborate across cultures. It will take place Oct. 11 at 11 a.m. ET.  Garan explained the importance of collaboration at the 2013 Social Good Summit. He calls it the \"orbital perspective\" — viewing the world as one whole piece instead of a lot of little parts, segmented by geographical and cultural borders. The idea that people need to embrace collaboration dawned on him when he was in orbit and noticed the manmade India-Pakistan border, he said. And while he knew the border existed, he still saw Earth as \"beautiful, tranquil and peaceful.\"  \"These are not clichés that astronauts say because it feels good,\" he said. Seeing the planet in that serene state made Garan realize that back on Earth, we need to start breaking down barriers. He wants to brainstorm ways that people from all cultures can work together, and hopes the first #KeyIsWe Hangout will start the conversation. It starts with collaboration, he explained, and communication \"fosters accountability that fosters trust.\" \"We don\\'t have to accept the status quo,\" he said. \"You don\\'t have to be in orbit to have the orbital perspective.\" About Social Good Summit  The Social Good Summit is where big ideas meet new media to create innovative solutions and is brought to you by Mashable, The 92nd Street Y, The United Nations Foundation, The United Nations Development Programme, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Ericsson.

       " ' A 25-year-old machinist in Pennsylvania has figured out how to make bullets that work in a 3D-printed gun. You can make your own 3D-printed gun, but, until now, shooting it was another matter.  There\\'s a fundamental mismatch between the typically plastic makeup of a 3D-printed object and the explosive nature of ammo. Firing bullets creates a mini explosion in the gun chamber, a force only contained and channeled forward behind the lead bullet by the average gun\\'s metal barrel. See also: I Drove a 3D Printed Car \"I noticed that a lot of the [3D-printed] guns were unsafe, to put it mildly,\" Michael Crumling, who is both interested in 3D printing and is an amateur gunsmith, told Mashable. \"One major flaw was that they were trying to use traditional ammunition in these guns.\"  No one was trying to make special ammo that wouldn’t turn the 3D printed gun they were holding into an unstable grenade, he said.  Michael Crumling\\'s homemade 3D ammo.Image:  Michael CrumlingThere have been a few cases of 3D-printed guns firing more than one shot of real ammo, most notably the Canadian developer who claimed to have fired 14 shots before his 3D-printed rifle broke. Most other 3D-printed guns fail with real ammo during the first shot. All that heat and pressure is, it seems, too much to handle for PLA, the material typically used in 3D printing. There are 3D-printed metal guns, but they\\'ve only been printed on costly machines by actual gun manufacturers.  The schematic for Michael Crumling\\'s 3D printed gun ammo.Image:  Michael CrumlingAs others tested ammo in 3D-printed guns, Crumling, watched from the sidelines. Then a year ago, he began work on custom designing and building his own ammo for 3D-printed guns. It wasn\\'t easy work. His first test wasn\\'t successful.  \"Part of the gun pretty much exploded,\" Crumling said. Still, when he collected the pieces, he found the shell intact and realized the design flaw was in his 3D-printed gun. That gun now has some metal bits to hold it together and a piece of metal inside to make it legal, meaning detectable by metal scanners.  Michael Crumling 3D Printed GunImage:  Michael CrumlingEventually, though, Crumling figured it out. With a shell both thicker and longer than a traditional bullet, Crumling\\'s ammo looks more like a shotgun shell than a bullet. That signature look, though, is the secret sauce. When the 3D gun\\'s trigger is pulled and the hammer hits the back of the bullet, the gunpowder charge is ignited just as it would be in a regular gun. In this case, however, the bullet itself contains and channels the explosion, helping to protect the plastic housing of the 3D printed gun.  “The cartridges contain all of the pressure generated by the gun powder,” said Crumling, explaining why his 3D gun ammo works better than traditional bullets. Crumling has now used his home-made ammo, which he calls .314 Atlas, to shoot 19 rounds on a PLA-based 3D printed gun. For now, the bullet is still a round lead ball, and each round is hand-made, for roughly 27 cents apiece. Not everyone is happy about Crumling\\'s breakthrough. \"This just shows that the technology is one step closer to being available to the general public,\" said Michael McLively, staff attorney for national watchdog group the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. You don\\'t need a gun license to print a 3D gun just a 3D printer, which range in price from $400 to thousands of dollars. One of the key barriers to these DIY guns\\' proliferation is functionality, noted McLively.  \"If you can prove they work as well as a regular gun, and you can evade the background check process, it makes it that much easier for dangerous people to get 3D printed guns,\" McLively said.  Crumling captures the moment his 3D printed gun fires one of his homemade bullets.Image:  Michael CrumlingAs Crumling notes, though, he cannot legally sell his 3D-printed ammo, telling Mashable he would need a Federal Firearms License to sell any ammo — 3D-printed-gun ready, or not. He is, however, planning on sharing the blueprints for the bullets on his own website, something that does concern McLively who thinks it could create \"a waterfall effect,\" where others build upon and perfect what Crumling was doing. 3D-printed guns that can successfully fire multiple rounds may lead to the development of 3D-printed automatics and semi-automatics, something Crumling believes is a real possibility.  \"They may not look anything like traditional automatic firearms though,\" he said, adding that he has no plans on creating any firearms. McLively sees it all as a slippery slope. \"It\\'s not hard to imagine the havoc that could create if someone prints a 3D machine gun in their garage,\" he said. For now, the bullets are still in the prototype stage. When asked about accuracy of shooting a bullet out of what is essentially a gun barrel inside another gun barrel, Crumling said he is \"not even to the point of messing with accuracy yet.\" Bonus: I Printed a Gun  ',\n",

       " ' It\\'s one of the most severe passive-aggressive disses of the social media age. It\\'s a belittling gesture of another human being\\'s insignificance. It can lead to introspection, self-doubt and vindictive muttering. We\\'re speaking, of course, about the Twitter unfollow. And, it turns out, even sports stars are susceptible to the antisocial action\\'s power to peeve. ESPN The Magazine\\'s latest issue features a profile of 20-year-old tennis phenom Sloane Stephens, who surged to prominence in January after beating Serena Williams to win the Australian Open. The piece, which hit the web Monday, goes into some detail about a falling-out between Stephens and Williams since the upset victory, and here\\'s part of what Stephens has to say:   \"She\\'s not said one word to me, not spoken to me, not said hi, not looked my way, not been in the same room with me since I played her in Australia,\" Stephens says emphatically. \"And that should tell everyone something, how she went from saying all these nice things about me to unfollowing me on Twitter.\" Her mom tries to slow her down, but Sloane is insistent. \"Like, seriously! People should know. They think she\\'s so friendly and she\\'s so this and she\\'s so that — no, that\\'s not reality! You don\\'t unfollow someone on Twitter, delete them off of BlackBerry Messenger. I mean, what for? Why?\"  But that\\'s not all the Twitter drama. Stephens also responded to this alleged subtweet Williams posted two days after the open:   I made you. — Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) January 26, 2013  \"I was like, \\'You really don\\'t think I know that that\\'s about me?\\'\" Stephens tells the magazine. Interestingly enough, back when she won the Open, Stephens was already thinking social media.  \"I hope to have a lot more Twitter followers,\" she said in a televised interview immediately following the match. She ended up getting that wish, and then some. Stephens\\' followers more than doubled in the hours following her win and she received congratulatory tweets from Shaquille O\\'Neal, Dirk Nowitzki, John Legend and other celebrities.  Between the high hopes and unspoken snubs, it seems, Stephens is truly a sports star for the digital era.

       " ' The print industry has long had to deal with disruptive aggregators, but for radio, this conflict is just starting to take shape. Promising mobile apps like Swell and AGOGO launched this summer, representing a new challenge to legacy media companies like National Public Radio. These apps create new listening experiences for consumers of talk and news because they tie together segments of audio into customizable and curated streams.  AGOGO combines podcasts with segments from NPR, the BBC, audio from videos and text-to-speech versions of newspaper articles. And Swell has been dubbed the “Pandora for news.” I’m a producer at an NPR member station, and these are frightening words in my world. Pandora dealt a massive wound to our cousins in music radio. The advertising dollars Pandora sucked up will likely never return to the table for terrestrial radio. That\\'s just the new reality. Despite the presence of podcasts and a handful of radio-streaming apps already on the market, talk and news distributors have largely been spared a Pandora-style disruption. Yet Pandora is still the elephant in the room, the boogie-man we know is out there. “The monopoly advantage of the radio tower will begin to fade,” former NPR Chief Executive Officer Vivian Schiller said. “New digital-only startups will enter the marketplace in audio, and you will find yourselves longing for the days when the competition was that public radio station that overlapped with your broadcast signal.” Outgoing NPR CEO Gary Knell, who announced his resignation Monday, has echoed these concerns as well. In a July Wall Street Journal interview, Knell said NPR was working on a “Pandora for news.”   “It’s a work in progress,” he said. “But we\\'re all over this, because if we don\\'t do this we\\'re not going to last.”  In the world of terrestrial radio, aggregation is new, but curation is not a foreign concept. At my radio station, we curate a mix of NPR national news and locally produced content for a local audience of about 40,000 listeners a month. You can hear Michelle Norris in the mornings and Ira Glass on the weekends, but you’ll also hear news that we think is relevant to the local community.  Its strength is that it’s a one-touch solution that allows you to multitask while you consume the content. Of course, it’s not a personalized solution since it doesn’t react to the user. A savvy consumer can already buck the system a little. They can download podcasts of \"This American Life,\" and they can stream national content directly from NPR.org. But the reason why my employer still exists is because local matters to people. This, anyway, is the party line. And it’s what I told JD Heilprin, CEO of AGOGO when we sat down for an interview.  I said we know that our listeners want good national content, so the station carries NPR programming. But we want to give them things that are relevant to their surroundings, so we mix in some local news and talk, too. In a world without signal monopoly, that’s the value proposition of the local radio station.   “Which is precisely the way that we look at it as well,” Heilprin told me. AGOGO acts a little more like a local radio station than the blank slate Pandora provides. Like Pandora, it will react to your specific input by saving content that you like and giving you more of it. But if you provide it with your commute information, it’ll give you traffic and weather for your area. Location data helps it find news and sports scores for your area. It’ll even provide your horoscope for the day. It’s still Pandora-like in that you can either sit-back and listen, or you can actively curate your streams. But Heilprin doesn’t talk a lot about Pandora. He talks about Twitter. “We’ve quickly become a Twitter-enabled world where the world changes and it changes very quickly,\" he said. \"Things like radio and satellite radio are not really equipped to service that world.” Developers at NPR know that “Pandora for news” isn’t the end-all-be-all solution it sounds like. “‘Pandora for news\\' is an easy way to explain to the public the breadth of our ambition,” said Demian Perry, head of mobile for NPR. Perry is responsible for the Infinite Player, a little-known digital experiment that offers a continuous shuffle of NPR content and reacts to your up or down votes. “We want to create a listening app for the spoken word that is as elegant and addictive as Pandora\\'s solution for music,” Perry told me. The Infinite Player is only optimized for the chrome desktop browser, although a beta app for iPhone has been available since May. Recent additions have included “channels” not unlike AGOGO’s, which stream topic-based content like “Music in Performance” and “Just the News.” Perry also thinks Twitter has some good lessons for audio apps.  “Twitter finds ways of surfacing content that is trending now,\" he said. \"That’s something that’s interesting to us.\" But he’s quick to shoot down the notion that any one model will “crack the code” of digital audio in the talk space. \"For us to succeed we need to be open to the ideas of the whole tech community,\" Perry said. \"It\\'s not a problem that we can solve alone.” Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Scott PhamScott Pham is the digital content editor for NPR member station KBIA.

       " ' One morning you might wake up, roll over, grab your phone and flip through the pictures from last night, from yesterday. \"Was it really that great of a time?\" you ask, and you\\'ve got a stream of photos to help you answer, the ones you want to delete from memory and the ones you\\'ll frame on the wall, or at least post to Facebook. An iOS app released Friday called Days, built by TechStars company Wander, aims to replace your phone\\'s camera roll, with a twist: Instead of deciding which photos to share, you\\'ll decide which to remove (but photos are also saved to your phone, so you don\\'t lose them completely). The photos you share will be grouped into a 24-hour set, from 5 a.m. to 5 a.m. on your local time zone, what founder and CEO Jeremy Fisher calls \"the folk definition of what a day is.\" The hope, Fisher says, is to capture a narrative by plotting these pictures in a group, to make a place for those photos that would not make sense on their own. You can\\'t cheat: You can only add photos you\\'ve taken inside the app, and they will be timestamped.   Before public release, the app was used in a beta of fewer than 100 users. \"Big users are parents with young kids,\" Fisher says. The reason Days will be appealing to new parents, vacationers and people with mundane lives alike is that the day is a great normalizer. No matter how many photos are taken (on someone\\'s too-awesome trip to Spain), each person you follow can share just once per day, which addresses oversharing and activity stream hijacking unlike any other social app. Your friends (and mom) don\\'t need to have Days to see your photos — you can share a day via text message, email, or post to Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr. Privacy controls are standard — your account is either public or private, but you can still share to social networks from a private account if you\\'d like to share selectively. GIF-Like Animation One of the best features of Days was created by accident. When you look at a Day, you might see that some photos behave as GIFs, a theme present in recent apps including Vine and Cinemagram.  But the decision to loop photos was to cut down on the volume — that thing where you take a bunch of photos in a row trying to catch the whole family without anyone blinking, or the dog in the air capturing the frisbee. The feature was meant to save you from having to delete duplicates, but turned out to capture movement through still photos (although if you\\'d like you can \"split\" the animation).   Days is designed to make documenting your life a habit. Fisher, a who says he is a longtime fan of National Geographic, says he wants to empower people to see the world through others\\' eyes, as photojournalism does, but the app helps regular people document daily life. Of course, Days\\' visual diary might bring to mind the potential of the camera on Google Glass. Fisher confirms the company will be building for Glass.  The decision to design for a 24-hour day was far from arbitrary. Fisher notes that phone numbers are seven digits because seven is a magic number for human memory. A text message was 160 characters because researchers found, amidst bandwidth limitations, it was sufficient space to communicate most thoughts (and the length of a tweet was inherited from text messages). The day is already a unit we use to organize memories. The company, which has raised a $1.2 million investment, had an focus on location earlier in its beta. Founders are Fisher and Keenan Cummings, creative director, and the team includes two engineers and a operations and community manager.  Image courtesy of mikebaird ',\n",
       " ' Despite an improved job market, employee morale is on the decline, new research shows. A study by Salary.com revealed an increased number of U.S. employees are lacking fulfillment, pride and commitment when it comes to how they view their work. Specifically, just 38.5% of workers are personally fulfilled by the work they do, down from 59% a year ago. Additionally, just over half of employees are committed to their work and career, compared with more than 70% who felt the same last year. Abby Euler, general manager at Salary.com, said that with the economy slowly improving employees may be taking a harder, more critical look at their lives, their work and personal situation. \"They\\'re evaluating their careers by measuring overall fulfillment and asking, \\'What does my career add to my life? Am I where I want to be in life?\\'\" Euler said. \"The psychological toll of the great recession may have caused people to feel \\'burnt out\\'; where in a down economy employees tended to put their head down, accept lower pay with more responsibility, and were often underemployed or even unemployed.\" The study shows that today\\'s workers aren\\'t as willing to do extra work and are more concerned with just collecting a paycheck each month. Less than 20% of those surveyed are willing to put in extra hours simply because they enjoy their work, down from 48.5% in 2012. At the same time, more than 70% are primarily working for their paycheck, up from 55% last year. Overall, less than 15% of those surveyed report their job provides a sense of accomplishment. Euler said the research paints a telling picture for employers when it comes to retaining their most valuable employees. \"Employers need to pay attention to their work force,\" she said. \"With the economy slowly on the mend, the grass may indeed be greener.\" The study was based on surveys of more than 2,000 employees.

       " ' RICHMOND, Va. — House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been defeated by a tea party-backed challenger in the Republican primary. Economics professor Dave Brat won a stunning upset victory against Cantor on Tuesday in the 7th District Republican primary contest, which is in the Richmond area. See also: Politicians Delete Digital Praise of Bowe Bergdahl Release Cantor is the second-most powerful member of the U.S. House and was seen by some as a possible successor to the House speaker. His loss to a political novice with little money marks a huge victory for the tea party movement, which supported Cantor just a few years ago. Brat had been a thorn in Cantor\\'s side on the campaign, casting the congressman as a Washington insider who isn\\'t conservative enough. Last month, a feisty crowd of Brat supporters booed Cantor in front of his family at a local party convention. His message apparently scored well with voters in the 7th District. \"There needs to be a change,\" said Joe Mullins, who voted in Chesterfield County Tuesday. The engineering company employee said he has friends who tried to arrange town hall meetings with Cantor, who declined their invitations. Tiffs between the GOP\\'s establishment and tea party factions have flared in Virginia since tea party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost last year\\'s gubernatorial race. Cantor supporters have met with stiff resistance in trying to wrest control of the state party away from tea party enthusiasts, including in the Cantor\\'s home district. Brat teaches at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school north of Richmond. He raised just more than $200,000 for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. Prominent national tea party groups did spend independently to help Brat. Brat offset the the cash disadvantage with endorsements from conservative activists like radio host Laura Ingraham, and with help from local tea party activists angry at Cantor. Much of the campaign centered on immigration, where critics on both sides have recently taken aim at Cantor. Brat has accused the House majority leader of being a top cheerleader for \"amnesty\" for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Cantor has responded forcefully by boasting in mailers of blocking Senate plans \"to give illegal aliens amnesty.\" It was a change in tone for Cantor, who has repeatedly voiced support for giving citizenship to certain immigrants brought illegally to the country as children. Cantor and House GOP leaders have advocated a step-by-step approach rather than the comprehensive bill backed by the Senate. They\\'ve made no move to bring legislation to a vote and appear increasingly unlikely to act this year. Cantor, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2000. He became majority leader in 2011. ',\n",
       " ' LONDON — The world\\'s first national sperm bank opened its doors in Britain on Thursday calling for \"very special men\" to help reduce the shortage of sperm donations in the UK and address the reliance on donations from abroad.  Based in Birmingham, the National Sperm Bank, will be a collaboration between the National Gamete Donation Trust and Birmingham Women’s Hospital that, among other things, aims to \"change the face\" of sperm donations. See also: Remote Control Spermbots Could Deliver Drugs, Fertilize Eggs \"We actually want sperm donors to be very proud about what they do,\" said Laura Witjens, Chief Executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust, on the BBC 4 Today programme. Until now, people living in London, Birmingham or Manchester could get sperm donations as part of fertility treatments with the aid of the National Health Service. Elsewhere in the country, however, those seeking a donation had to buy sperm from abroad or use a private clinic, Witjens said. In particular, there has been a shortage of donations among some ethnic minorities. Although the quality of sperm from abroad was generally good, it did result in situations where the same donor\\'s sperm was being used up to 10 times in multiple countries in Europe, Witjens said, meaning that someone conceived through a sperm donation could end up having 50 or 60 genetic half siblings across the continent.  First donors are calling in already for @NatSpermBank. Thanks http://t.co/aCkZlN1PCm — Laura Witjens (@LauraWitjens) October 30, 2014  There\\'s an increasing need for sperm donations in the UK because there are more same sex couples having children and because people in general are waiting until they’re older before starting a family, Dr. Allan Pacey, Chairman of the British Fertility Society, told Mashable. The National Sperm Bank, however, should not be been as a magic bullet solution for fertility problems, and education about fertility still needs improvement, Pacey said, adding that when the topic comes up, people in the UK \"still giggle.\" Currently, sperm donations are used in approximately 10 percent of fertility treatments in the UK. In the UK, a sperm donor is not considered the legal father of the child, though someone born after April 1, 2005, conceived using a sperm donation has the right to find out identifying information about the donor.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' A little less than two years ago, Google laid out plans to roll out a new lightning-fast Internet network that would make buffering and load times a thing of the past. That dreamlike service had only been available in three cities to date: Kansas City, Austin and Provo, Utah. On Wednesday, Google announced that it had \"invited\" 34 cities across nine metropolitan areas to work with it in order to determine whether and how to hook them up with Fiber, too. Those cities include Atlanta, San Jose, Charlotte and Portland, among others.  See also: 10 Simple Google Calendar Tips and Tricks to Boost Your Productivity Judging by the headlines in local news outlets, you\\'d think these cities had just won a golden ticket. \"Nashville on the short list...\" one headline in a Nashville publication began. \"Google picks Charlotte,\" another publication\\'s headline began. \"Google Fiber takes a fresh look at Portland,\" said a third.  There\\'s certainly reason to be excited. The introduction of Fiber in Kansas City led to a burst of startup activity, not to mention being a welcome option for average consumers. Rich Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG, went to visit Kansas City in 2012 shortly after Fiber arrived there and described the general feedback this way: \"It\\'s amazing. Who wouldn\\'t want it?\" The real debate wasn\\'t whether consumers would have an appetite for such a service; it was whether Google was committed to making the investment necessary to build it out on a large scale. According to Greenfield, the announcement Wednesday answered that question conclusively. \"I think this went from science experiment to real business today,\" Greenfield told Mashable. \"Most people had blown this off as not real because they would never launch in a major city. This is now serious cities.\" So what exactly does Google gain by becoming a broadband provider? In a few words: anything and everything.  Greenfield and other analysts we spoke with rattled off a long list of factors that may be driving Google\\'s thinking with Fiber. It can serve as a profitable standalone business, which is something that Google\\'s CFO highlighted in a recent earnings call. It gives Google yet another avenue into users\\' homes and all the data that comes with it. It helps pressure other providers to embrace higher-speed network, which paves the way to support Google\\'s future Internet applications. \"Google is working on the next generation of Internet application software that requires better bandwidth, so they are helping to enable that infrastructure,\" Greenfield says. Google might not singlehandedly build out that infrastructure — in fact, it most certainly won\\'t — but just by trying it can force other providers to do so. News of the possible Fiber expansion comes at an interesting time for Google and other Internet companies.A few days earlier, Comcast announced plans to acquire Time Warner Cable in a deal that further consolidates power in the industry. A few hours earlier, the FCC announced plans to overhaul net neutrality rules.  Andrew Frank, an analyst with Gartner, says it\\'s likely that Google\\'s continued investment in Fiber is intended to address each of these issues. It\\'s in Google\\'s best interest to ensure \"that there\\'s healthy competition in broadband services,\" which Frank says has the effect of \"keeping prices down... and motivating infrastructure providers whether Google is one of them or not in pushing the envelope of quality and service.\" As for the net neutrality policy, he adds: \"If google and companies like Google can\\'t rely on regulatory solutions to enforce net neutrality rules, then they are going out have to reply on market forces.\"  Even so, Frank isn\\'t 100% convinced that Google is serious about Fiber becoming a serious, longterm business commitment for Google. \"It\\'s always hard to distinguish with Google true intentions and head fakes,\" he says.  The announcement on Wednesday certainly left some room for both.  \"While we do want to bring Fiber to every one of these cities, it might not work out for everyone,\" Milo Medin, Google\\'s VP of Access Services, wrote in the blog post, almost trying to break future bad news to some of these cities gently. \"But cities who go through this process with us will be more prepared for us or any provider who wants to build a fiber network.\" Any provider. Whether it\\'s Google or not. ',\n",
       " ' The new BlackBerry Z10 smartphone won\\'t be out for weeks, but you can already get your hands on it via eBay for about $1,500. BlackBerry — the company formerly known as Research In Motion (RIM) — announced the new smartphone at an event earlier this week and handed out samples to guests and members of the press in attendance. It didn\\'t take long for the Z10, which could potentially turn around the struggling company, to pop up on eBay.   One page notes \"this particular device was given to all attendees of the Jan. 30, 2013 product launch.\" BlackBerry didn\\'t tell attendees what they can or can\\'t do with the device, which comes unlocked, according to the listing, and without a SIM card. Four units are currently being sold on eBay, with bids starting at $800 and rising quickly. The auction for the one going for $1,500, which has eight bids so far, will end this afternoon. Images by Mashable and via eBay, eBay BONUS: BlackBerry Z10 Is Exceptional, But Perplexing   BlackBerry Z10 Review        BlackBerry Z10 The Z10 is the first BlackBerry 10 smartphone. It doesn\\'t work like most other smartphones (notice there\\'s no home button), so it has a fairly steep learning curve for anyone used to iOS or Android. However, it\\'s also a powerful organizer and has much friendlier feel than previous BlackBerry phones. RIM expects the Z10 to be available on all four of the major U.S. carriers for $199 (with contract).          Backside The back of the Z10 is what rim calls \"soft touch,\" a slightly rubberized material that bestows a firm grip. It\\'s also removable, letting the user swap out a new SIM, a microSD card or a spare battery.          Right Side: Volume/Mute Buttons The volume buttons have slight indentations so you can find them by touch alone, and the middle button controls play/pause or mute (depending on the app).          Left Side The left side has ports for microUSB and microHDMI for connecting to an external display.          Top Here\\'s the power/sleep button and the headphone jack, as well as a small microphone port.          Bottom The bottom has a slot to ease taking off the back.          Lock Screen In lieu of a home button, you can activate the lock screen just by sliding your finger up from the bottom of the screen. The execution is slick.          App Array Like most smartphones today, the Z10 shows apps as an array of icons. When you swipe between screens, the animation has them fade out and overlap each other slightly.          Minimized Apps You swipe app to minimize any apps running, and they appear here. They\\'re still running (or paused when appropriate -- say, a game) you can resume where you left off anytime. Up to eight apps can run in minimized state at any given time.          The Hub BlackBerry 10\\'s Hub is where all your email, text messages, BBM messages and social-network notifications reside. You can change the view to display just one account, or a mix. Swiping down from the top shows your coming calendar appointments.          Hub Accounts Swiping in from the left of the Hub shows your account list. Tap one to show just notifications from that account.          Peek On virtually any screen on the Z10, you can swipe up and hold to see your notifications on the left.          Peeking Further Sweep right to \"peek\" at the Hub. The screen tracks your finger movements precisely.          Type Predictor The BlackBerry onscreen keyboard will predict what the next word you want to type might be, giving you several options over various keys. To select one, swipe up from the key. It takes getting used to.          Time Shifting Camera The Z10\\'s camera has a Time Shift mode, which lets you turn back the clock on any particular person\\'s facial expression by a second or two, letting you perfect that shot where someone blinked.          BlackBerry Messenger RIM\\'s popular BlackBerry Messenger has gotten an upgrade for BB10.          BBM Video Chat You can now do video chats with BBM, similar to Apple\\'s FaceTime or Skype. It works best on Wi-Fi or LTE.          Screen Share A useful tool that goes with BBM video chats is Screen Share. Just tap the icon and you\\'ll share what you\\'re looking at with your chat partner. The screen will appear a little fuzzy, though.          BlackBerry Balance BlackBerry Balance lets will partition your Z10 for both work and personal use. It\\'s something your company would do if you decided to use the Z10 as a work phone, and RIM says\\' it\\'s physically impossible for the two sides to share data (such as photos). However, the device still has one phone number, and your notifications are united.          Browser The BB10 webkit browser is pretty bare-bones, but it makes the nice choice of putting the URL bar at the bottom of the screen -- handy for thumbs.       ',\n",
       " ' FIFA, soccer\\'s global governing body, confirmed this week that goal-line technology will be used at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.  That will mark the first time the planet\\'s biggest single-sport event uses the high-tech method of determining whether or not the ball crosses the plane of the goal.  Goal-line technology was used at the Club World Cup in December and will be used again at this summer\\'s Confederations Cup — a World Cup preview of sorts held in the big event\\'s host nation one year before the World Cup.  High profile soccer matches have been beset by a number of did-he-or-didn\\'t-he scoring controversies over the years. Judging controversial goals in soccer is especially difficult, because scoring requires the entire ball to completely cross the goal line. That can make it quite tough for referees to judge an iffy shot unless they have an optimal angle and line of sight.  SEE ALSO: 2014 World Cup in Brazil Already Going Social and Mobile  \"After a successful implementation of Goal-Line Technology (GLT) at the Club World Cup in Japan in December 2012, FIFA has decided to use GLT at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,\" a FIFA statement read this week. \"The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests.\" There are a number of similar products out there, however, and just which one makes it to Brazil remains to be seen. According to the BBC, products called GoalRef and Hawk-Eye, along with additional bids from a pair of unnamed German firms, will be considered. FIFA is expected to make a decision by some time this April.  While GoalRef and Hawk-Eye both achieve the same ends, their respective means of doing so rely on differing technological approaches.  Hawk-Eye, which is owned by Sony, uses high-speed video cameras positioned at different angles to determine the ball\\'s precise location via triangulation. GoalRef, which is produced by the German company Fraunhofer, uses magnetic sensors to determine whether or not a goal was scored.  Do you think goal-line technology should be included in the 2014 World Cup, or is a bit of uncertainty just part of the game? Give us your take in the comments.

And VICE is pretty much the leader in high-quality, compelling online video.” Sattler said that the featured artists will be globally relevant and locally sourced, and that the videos and photos will be distributed through all of Budweiser’s major and rising global markets. The six franchises include:  “Made Me,\" which will feature successful artists and examine the story behind a specific track; “Turning Points,\" which will explore pivotal moments in artists’ careers; \"Made In a Minute,” which will summarize artists’ journeys in 60 seconds; “Gig Posters,\" which will spotlight a series of posters that represent each artist’s story using stylized images and quotes; “I’m With the Band,” which will shed light on the experience of being on the road with the artists;  \"Newsroom,” which will go behind the scenes at Budweiser’s Made in America festival, the culmination of the content platform. \"We\\'ve crisscrossed the globe to cover the remarkable career stories of today\\'s most talented artists,\" said Jonathan Hunt, global marketing director at VICE. \"The Budweiser Made for Music program is the ideal venue for this video content, giving music fans the world over a captivating glimpse into the lives, creative processes and turning points of these musicians.\" Facebook will act as the primary distribution platform for Made for Music, and all of the content franchises will be collected and organized via a Canvas application on Budweiser’s page. \"Budweiser\\'s Made for Music program will thrive in the Facebook News Feed because it was designed to be high quality, fun to consume and meant to be enjoyed with friends, just like the product itself,\" said Keenan Pridmore, creative strategist at Facebook.

After the festival, the brand will extend the program through October featuring rising artists in Budweiser markets across the globe.  Update: On Wednesday, Budweiser unveiled the teaser for the \"Made\" content on its Facebook and YouTube pages. The \"Made Me\" franchise will officially premiere Friday with its full first episode, which features London duo AlunaGeorge and takes a close look at the group’s breakthrough song, “You Know You Like It.” Check out the music video of the song below.  Sattler cited the first AlunaGeorge episode as an example of the \"engaging and interesting storytelling\" Budweiser is gunning for, and as the brand engages with more artists, Sattler said bands and musicians will cycle through the different franchises to give fans in-depth, insider previews before Budweiser\\'s two-day festival kicks off at the end of summer. Budweiser’s Made for Music global campaign, which launched earlier last week in 85 countries, also featured partnerships with Jay-Z and Rihanna. The two superstars were featured in 30-second spots set to Hova\\'s \"PSA\" and Rihanna\\'s latest single \"Right Now\"; both were shot by director Mark Romanek.  The Made for Music campaign was inspired by last summer\\'s Budweiser Made in America festival, which Jay-Z curated and headlined in Philadelphia. All of Budweiser\\'s custom content will also be available on the brand\\'s YouTube channel.

Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga, formerly known by her legal name Stefani Germanotta, performed this original song at NYU\\'s annual talent show.  You can hear the beginnings of Gaga\\'s hit \"Poker Face\" in this song, however, Germanotta only placed third in the talent show.            2. Louis C.K.  Before Louis C.K. was considered a leader in comedy, he was working up the courage to do standup around Boston.  Today, C.K. drops all existing material and starts over every year, but this act from 1987 shows a young version of the comedian\\'s familiar, sarcastic attitude. Note: If you\\'re at work, keep the volume down. The language is NSFW.           3. Justin Timberlake  Singer and actor Justin Timberlake was performing onstage long before he became a member of boy band *NSYNC.  Here, a young Timberlake performs on the talent show Star Search around the same time he was a mouseketeer. Today, the performer has maintained a successful solo career.           4. Angelina Jolie\\r   This video shows Angelina Jolie\\'s acting debut as Tosh in the 1982 film Lookin\\' To Get Out.  At just seven years-old, the award-winning actress was younger than some of her children today.           5. Scarlett Johannson  In 1993, a nine-year-old Scarlett Johannsson was just beginning her career as an actress, as shown in this audition tape.  Johannsson debuted a year later in the comedy North.            6. Fergie  Stacy \"Fergie\" Ferguson was singing on the TV show Kids Incorporated before she became a member of The Black Eyed Peas. (Fun fact: Even earlier, she was the voice of Sally in the Peanuts cartoons.) Today, Fergie is still a B.E.P. band member and has an established solo career.           7. Ryan Gosling  Actor Ryan Gosling was one of many other celebrities within the Mickey Mouse Club. Today, Gosling has become an award-winning actor, known for his roles in The Notebook and Drive.  This clip of him as a kid shows the same charm he uses to woo the ladies today.           8. The Olsen Twins  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen grew up to become two of the most successful child stars to-date.  The twins tapped in on a franchise at a very early age, beginning with film series like The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley and You\\'re Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley\\'s....           9. Leonardo Dicaprio  A rambunctious, five-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio got started on a show called Romper Room, which unfortunately shares no clips of him online. However, the actor eventually worked his way up to film roles, like Inception. This video shows some of the commercial work DiCaprio did in between.           10. Zach Galafianakis  Comedian Zach Galafianakis was writing comedy behind the scenes before he was known for being in front of the camera in films like The Hangover. In this clip, he acts on a shortly-lived MTV sketch comedy called Apt. 2F            11. Katy Perry  Katheryn Hudson switched from Christian singer to candy-coated pop star Katy Perry after 2007.  Today, the Grammy-nominated singer is the only artist to spend more than 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of Billboard\\'s Hot 100.           12. Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell  Though it was cancelled before the complete first season, the Dana Carvey Show featured some of the most successful comedians to date, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, Charlie Kaufman and Louis C.K. This clip is a sketch from the show, featuring a young Colbert and Carell, before their more recent TV fame.           13. Natalie Portman  In 1994, Natalie Portman made her acting debut in the film Leon: The Professional. This clip is from her audition for the role of Mathilda. After her breakout role in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, Portman went on to become an award-winning actress.           14. Beyoncé Knowles  Singer Beyoncé was part of Girl\\'s Tyme, the group that would eventually become Destiny\\'s Child, before she was known for her successful solo career.  This video shows Beyoncé competing with Girl\\'s Tyme on Star Search, but losing to the band Skeleton Crew.           15. Kristen Stewart  Twilight\\'s leading lady Kristen Stewart has been acting since she was a child.  The actress was in a variety of films as a kid, but this clip proves she was also doing commercials.           ',\n",
       " ' After years of focusing on growth and precious little to show for its recent monetization efforts, Foursquare announced a program on Monday to let all businesses advertise on its platform. The initiative expands on a beta program Foursquare had launched this summer with 800 businesses across the globe. On Monday, Foursquare launched a self-service page where businesses can state their business needs and their budgets. Foursquare will do the rest.  See also: Foursquare Update Adds Real-Time Recommendations \"You can say, \\'Here\\'s the business I want to drive traffic to, here\\'s how much I want to spend and here\\'s my monthly budget. Go for it,\\'\" says Noah Weiss, Foursquare\\'s director of product management. Such businesses have a choice between two basic kinds of ads: search and on the Foursquare home screen.  Foursquare will provide metrics for the ad, including the number of views, actions, action rate and cost per action.  One vendor who used the ads in beta says they work pretty well. Paul Kermizian, who runs Barcade, a small chain of game bars, ran ads that targeted people who were near one his locations and regularly frequented bars. Kermizian spent $150 a month per location for the ads.  \"The response has been very positive,\" he says. \"We\\'ve seen increased traffic in Foursquare users, our ratings online and in actual sales.\" For Foursquare, the question will be whether other vendors will follow suit. After focusing on growth for the first few years of its existence, Foursquare began trying to monetize the platform last year via ads. The company reportedly made just $2 million in revenues last year despite a valuation around $760 million.  Image: Mashable composite ',\n",
       " ' On Tumblr, users can post a huge variety of content and media. So, it\\'s no surprise the social blogging platform hosts wildly diverse communities. Some of these groups are so big and so active they become subcultures in their own right. They take over tags, earn thousands of reblogs and even create dedicated blogs entirely dedicated to one, very specific subject. Most Tumblr users partake in one or several different subcultures, depending on their personal interests. Because Tumblr allows users to create multiple blogs, a single account can have various subculture-related blogs, as well as a personal one.  See also: 11 Tumblr Tips for Power Users Whether you want to become an active participant in one or six of them, here are some of the most prominent and popular Tumblr subcultures. Fandoms Image: Tumblr, Emma Armstrong Tumblr has become home to hundreds of fan communities, also known as fandoms. A fandom can involve any form of media — TV shows, books, movies, music, etc. While fandoms do exist outside of Tumblr, and have for a long time, this social media platform is where they currently thrive.  These fandoms often produce lots of fan art, fan fiction and host discussion on various elements concerning their favorite media. Said discussion can be about anything, such as the serious implications of the show\\'s treatment of women or which reality show couple should just kiss and live happily ever after.  Some fandoms are bigger than others or have more active users, though their popularity does not always correlate to how well-perceived the piece of media is offline. The examples below are some fandoms that are unique to or began on Tumblr. SuperWhoLock SuperWhoLock is a combination of the three television shows: Supernatural, Doctor Who and Sherlock. Fans often group these three shows together because users who enjoy one tend to watch the other two as well. Separately, the three have huge fan bases on Tumblr; however, the shows are often combined into one name for the sake of brevity. For a prime example of this fandom amalgamation in action, check out SuperWhoLock and Others. Homestuck Homestuck is an animated webcomic created by Andrew Hussie. Many of these fans congregate on Tumblr, discussing characters, creating fan art and setting up IRL meetups for local fans. Celebrity and Tumblr user Dante Basco is also a big fan of the webcomic and even has a character based on him, called Rufioh. If you\\'re interested, read the comic or check out Today in Homestuck to get an idea of the story.  Welcome to Night Vale The Welcome to Night Vale fandom is unique because it grew before the podcast\\'s popularity. In fact, the series\\' steadily increasing fan base is in part thanks to enthusiastic fans on Tumblr who encouraged others to listen in. Since the show has no visuals, many fans like to draw their interpretations of various characters and scenes, even writing their own episodes or interpreting previous episodes in video form. If you want to check out Night Vale\\'s community on Tumblr, the -Welcome To Night Vale is a great place to get started. Food Porn Image: Tumblr, treatsforme Much like Pinterest and Instagram, many Tumblrs are dedicated to taking pictures of their gorgeous looking meals or snacks. This type of media is often referred to as \"food porn.\"  Among these blogs, some users create homemade meals plus the recipes on how to make them. These users are often happy to answer questions about techniques, ingredients and other culinary inquiries, so their followers can replicate the dish at home.   See also: The Beginner\\'s Guide to Tumblr Other users take pictures of food from restaurants and post them with the restaurant information and dish name. This is great for Tumblr users who like to travel or who want to find new restaurants in their own backyard, complete with pictures. It\\'s especially helpful for people with specific diets, for example, vegetarians, vegans or those who keep kosher or halal. Many users with special dietary needs tend to have their own Tumblr blogs about finding restaurants that cater to those diets.  Other blogs, like We Are Always Hungry, take or reblog photos of delicious food you\\'ll never be able to eat — just to torture your tastebuds. Editor\\'s Picks  Feast Upon This! Food Porn Pretty Foods  Fitspo Image: Tumblr, fitforyouandme. If you\\'re looking to lose weight in a healthy way and want some support, the Fitspo community on Tumblr could help inspire you.  Often called \"fitspo\" or \"fitsoporation,\" this Tumblr subculture is all about fitness and dieting. Unlike \"thinspiration,\" fitspo focuses just on eating right and working out to achieve better health, rather than  simply lose pounds. Users often post workout regimens, healthy snack recipes and inspirational quotes and images, like the one above. While typically society\\'s model of better health involves a thin woman or muscular man, the community embraces all members trying gain a better life through daily exercise and a good diet. Those in the community often post before-and-after pictures of themselves as they improve their healthy habits.  Editor\\'s Picks  The Ultimate Fitspo Healthy is the New Skinny Fitsporationale  Body Positivity Image: Tumblr, Fit and Healthy If you\\'re happy just the way you are, there\\'s a movement on Tumblr for you, too. Body positivity advocates self-acceptance and health at any size, while simultaneously speaking out against body-shaming and fat-shaming. Posters in this tag tend to be supportive of those who want to lose weight, as well as those happy with their size, and encourage all to lead fun and active lives.  Posts from this community tend to be quotes about accepting who you are in the face of harassment and hostile language, discussions with people about daily challenges and encouragement to get through one day at a time. Posters also showcase pictures of their own bodies of all different types and sizes in an act of taking control of their own self-image and feeling comfortable in their own, despite what others may say. Editor\\'s Picks  Adios Barbie A Better Place My Dear Body  Social Justice Some users are active in fighting against social injustices, including racism, misogyny, homophobia, trans-phobia, etc. Sometimes called \"social justice warriors,\" users who partakes in this subculture often consider themselves allies of various demographics, like the LGBTQ community or the African-American community, and take it upon themselves to educate others about the issues facing said groups. These users also log on to spread important information about troubling events, whether they\\'re on the news or spread by word-of-mouth. They organize online petitions, boycotts and other forms of peaceful protest. Typical posts also include upsetting news about hate crimes or discrimination, in-depth discussions about social and racial issues and general attempts to raise awareness on Tumblr. While there are not a lot of blog dedicated solely to social justice, unless they are in opposition to it, there is a community of users who reblog social justice content.

Whether real or animated, you\\'ll find Tumblrs dedicated to pictures of rabbits, like Awesome Bunnies, or to felines, like Derpy Cats.

Tumblr blogs can also act as an interactive online portfolios, where artists showcase their best work and share it with both followers and potential employers alike.

       " ' They read like Mean Girls meets pro football, but disturbing reports out of Miami this weekend shed light on bullying in the NFL.  The NFL bullying story is still developing, but here\\'s what we know so far: Second-year player Jonathan Martin left the Miami Dolphins last week after alleged harassment from teammates. Teammate Richie Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins this weekend after being tabbed as Martin\\'s main alleged tormentor. Incognito allegedly sent Martin racist, explicit text messages among other harassment, and, in retrospect, his Twitter history ominously foreshadows these recent developments.  See also: NFL Alum Blasts League Over Head Injuries, Health Care Martin left the Dolphins last week after a cafeteria prank. Teammates reportedly invited him to sit and eat with them, then all promptly got up and moved to another table as soon as he sat down. That reportedly triggered an emotional breakdown for Martin, who left the team to seek counseling and be with his family. The extremely unusual move prompted rampant speculation about what else had happened between Martin and his teammates, as well as how outside the norm it was for the NFL\\'s macho culture.  But the cafeteria incident wasn\\'t isolated — rather, it seems to have just been the metaphorical final straw for Martin. Among the ugliest examples to surface since then are details about voice and text messages Incognito sent Martin, according to reports from Fox Sports and CBS Sports.  Among the voice and text messages\\' reported contents are Incognito calling the biracial Martin a \"half n*****\" as well as threatening to defecate in his mouth and hurt members of his family. The NFL Players Association is currently investigating Martin\\'s treatment by teammates, and the Dolphins have asked the league to do the same. Much more information will surely emerge in the coming days and weeks. Meanwhile, Incognito took to Twitter on Sunday to deny the allegations:  @espn shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation. I won\\'t be holding my breathe for an apology — Richie incognito (@68INCOGNITO) November 3, 2013   @AdamSchefter Enough is enough If you or any of the agents you sound off for have a problem with me, you know where to find me #BRINGIT — Richie incognito (@68INCOGNITO) November 3, 2013   @espn @CBSSports @NBCSports @FOXSports @ProFootballTalk I want my name CLEARED — Richie incognito (@68INCOGNITO) November 3, 2013   Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Buddha — Richie incognito (@68INCOGNITO) November 3, 2013  Incognito is an NFL veteran who made the Pro Bowl in 2012. The same year, he finished second in a Sporting News poll of NFL personnel to determine the league\\'s dirtiest player.  As noted by ExtraMustard, the recent allegations against Incognito give this seemingly innocuous Twitter exchange from April an ominous undertone:  Image: Joel Auerbach/Getty Images       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Hey you! Yeah, you! Feeling pretty OK about the way you look today? Got a little extra spring in your step? Well, stop it right now and take a look down at your stomach and get out your ruler! Because you — yes you — may very well have an imperfect belly button. I know, right? Like you didn\\'t have enough to worry about. Via Daily Mail:  Surgeons at the University of Singapore\\'s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, whose research was published in ASJ, analyzed images of 37 Playboy Playmates (really) to assess the ideal length, shape and position of the navel. With the help of a computerized tool called an \\'Aesthetic Analyzer\\', they established that a perfect belly button has a ratio of 46:54, and a midline horizontal position. The ideal length is 5 percent of the length from the lower breastbone to the lower part of the vulvar cleft, and the \\'hood,\\' or flap, is very small.  Luckily, I am terrible at math and therefore have absolutely no interest in using it in order to find things wrong with myself. In fact, I can think of few things I would be less likely to voluntarily do.  However, plastic surgeon Dr. Adam Rubinstein of Miami, Florida, tells Today.com that most people just want their belly button to be in the \\'range of normal.\\' \\'Using Playboy Playmates is kind of an arbitrary sample. Just because these women are considered beautiful doesn\\'t mean they have beautiful belly buttons,\\' he said.  The \"range of normal?\" This is a thing? I mean, I have one friend with a slightly off-center belly-button, and we all find that kind of endearing. I have an all the way innie that comes to a point. I\\'m pretty OK with it. Aren\\'t belly buttons kind of just there? I mean, is there any such thing as a truly stunning one? I wouldn\\'t expect anyone to be so concerned about having an aesthetically perfect navel that they would have surgery. Then again, I wouldn\\'t expect anyone to want to be a Human Barbie Doll either, but here we are. Weirdly, this is not even the first research of this kind. There apparently have been multiple efforts to find the perfect female belly button. Because apparently no one cares about the aesthetic appeal of male belly buttons. Either that or there isn\\'t enough money in repairing all the other things we tell women are wrong with them.  Previous research to develop a navel aesthetic took place in 2000 at the University of Missouri, where images of 147 female belly buttons were shown to a panel of 15 men and 6 women. According to Charles L. Puckett\\'s journal article In Search of the Ideal Female Umbilicus, navels considered beautiful were small and vertically oriented, or T-shaped, while horizontal belly buttons were thought to be ugly.  Can you imagine being in that research group and trying to take it seriously? I am reasonably sure that after looking at and rating 147 belly buttons is a thing that could drive a person insane. Surely they would haunt your dreams for years to come. All of this aside, I assure you all — despite the fact that I don\\'t know you — that your belly button is probably 100% non-offensive, unless for some reason you still have your umbilical cord attached, because I bet that would be gross.

He originally began taking photographs for his small publishing house, Poetry Wanted, for a series called \"This is Not a Map,\" a collection of foldable maps for Texas, Las Vegas, Scotland and Japan.

       " '  Cable network TNT has dropped a sequel to the most-shared ad of all time, \"A Dramatic Surprise on a Quiet Square.\"  Like the previous ad, the new one, \"A Dramatic Surprise on an Ice-Cold Day,\" features a red button in the middle of a town square (this time in Holland, not Belgium) next to a sign that says \"Push to add drama.\" Shortly after that, a man in a body suit is lowered on a rope and offers the button-pusher a telephone. A voice says, \"Make a choice: Blue or yellow.\"  After choosing yellow, all hell breaks loose. A woman is shot, which causes her suitcase full of cash to open.

       " ' Samsung will hold its \"Unpacked 5\" event later this month on the first day of the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. With \"5\" snuck into the event\\'s tagline — and the timing for a new flagship device right on track — we\\'ll likely to see the unveiling of the next-generation, much-anticipated Galaxy S5 smartphone. Last year, Samsung didn\\'t launch the Galaxy S4 until weeks later at a separate event in New York City. A New York Times report indicates, however, that the Galaxy S5 is on the agenda for the event, and Samsung may even reveal new wearable device to follow the poorly reviewed Galaxy Gear smartwatch. See also: 25 Best Free Android Apps \"Unpacked 5\" is scheduled for Monday, Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. Eastern Time and livestreamed for those not attending the show. The event will be a key moment for Samsung, which received mixed reviews of its current Galaxy smartphone model (S4) and missed analyst expectations in its recent financial results. Although previous flagship Galaxy smartphones became best-sellers, the S4 didn\\'t have as much luck, although it still performed well. Last year, Samsung created much spectacle around its Galaxy S4 launch — not only did it hype the product with teaser trailers and even a flash mob in Times Square, the launch event was more like a Broadway show than a typical tech-industry presentation. There were singers, dancers, an orchestra and even an emcee. \"Unpacked 5\" will be more subdued in tone: we won\\'t see the same theatrics on stage as the S4 event, more low key, according to The New York Times. The focus will be more on the hardware and software updates than anything else. S5 is expected to come with new security software to appeal to business users as well as a faster processor and better camera. Although rumors have been swirling about an eye scanner that unlocks the device and the inclusion a ultra-high-resolution display, the Times reports those features won\\'t appear on the S5. There\\'s also talk of a full-screen fingerprint sensor, so the phone could be unlocked by touching any part of the screen, according to the iTechAddict blog, which has been right with insider tips in the past. We won\\'t know for sure what will be announced until the event, but Mashable will be on the ground in Barcelona reporting live, so check back soon for updates.

       " ' Internet culture is dominated by GIFs — and they just got even better. Photo-sharing site Imgur made a big improvement to the GIFs posted on its site by converting the files from the outdated .GIF format to a MP4 video format. See also: GIF vs. JIF: You\\'re Probably Still Saying It Wrong       Imgur announced Project \"GIFV\" (GIF Video) on Thursday as a part of an effort to make the files load more quickly and perform better. While the conversion doesn\\'t change anything you love about GIFs — they look and operate in the same way in the new format — they\\'re a lot more efficient. \"The cornerstone of Project GIFV is a platform-wide upgrade to automatically convert uploaded GIF files on the fly into the MP4 video format,\" Imgur wrote in a news release. \"The converted MP4s are significantly smaller than their equivalent GIFs, which allows them to load at lightning-fast speeds with better quality.\" The GIF embedded above, which Imgur uses as an example, is 50 MB in .GIF format. As a GIFV file, however, it\\'s only 3.4 MB and \"loads at warp speed.\" That\\'s a huge improvement, and one Imgur says will lower bandwidth consumption and optimize Imgur for mobile devices. You can embed the new .GIFV files anywhere that you were using .GIF files; plus, they can be longer and better quality while taking up far less space.  This concept is far from new, however. Gyfycat.com offers MP4-based GIFs, but Imgur is the most popular image-sharing service to adopt video GIFs in a widespread way. BONUS: GIF vs. JIF  ',\n",
       " \" We've seen interactive rings that receive alerts from your smartphone and even rings that will give you the current time in a unique way, but a new ring leapfrogs the rest by acting as a full-on control mechanism.  On its exterior, Logbar's Ring device looks like nothing more than a silver ring, but packed inside the device are electronics that allow it to recognize your finger gestures and control any number of devices.  See also: 7 Head-Turning Wearables We Saw This Week Logbar CEO Takuro Yoshida gave a detailed demonstration of the silver interactive device last year in San Francisco, and now Ring is available for purchase through a Kickstarter campaign.  By recognizing finger gestures, Ring allows the wearer to write text messages by simply drawing in the air. The same dynamic allows the wearer to access apps by drawing designated shapes in the air. For example, drawing a music note could access your music player, while drawing an envelope shape would allow you to access your email.    More advanced functions depicted in the company's Kickstarter video (see above) include using the Bluetooth device for mobile payments via GPS or iBeacon, and as a controller for televisions and lights in smart homes. The company also says that it has tested Ring with devices spanning a wide spectrum of currently available, bleeding-edge hardware, including the Pebble watch, quadcopter drones and even Google Glass.  Ring's associated app also allows you to program original shape gesture commands. This option could be particularly useful for disabled or visually impaired users with somewhat unconventional finger gesture patterns.  Image:  Logbar   To activate the device, you simply press the side button on the Ring, and to receive alerts you can either receive a vibration or view the discreet little LED pinpoints near the button port. According to the device's developers, Ring can perform up to 1,000 gestures before its battery needs to be recharged.  The only obvious shortcoming of the device at this point is that fact that it's not waterproof. That could turn into a problem for those attempting to use Ring in mobile environments during bad weather, or even inside the home, say, if you forget you have Ring on when you go to wash your hands.  Image:  Logbar   Also, Ring's rechargeable battery is not replaceable. Once it stops charging, the fun is over, and you'll have to pony up for a brand new Ring. That might not be as bad as it sounds. The cheapest early bird version of the device sold for $145, and during Yoshida's presentation last year he mentioned hopes of getting the device down to the $100 range.  At launch, the Ring app will only be available for iOS and Android devices, but the company has plans to release a Windows Phone version.   The device blew past its original Kickstarter goal of $250,000 in just its first five days of availability and, as of this writing, Ring had reached about $400,000 in funding, with nearly a full month left for new signups.  \",\n",
       " ' Fans of e-cigarettes — and their marijuana-based equivalent — may want to take a moment right now for a celebratory puff. That\\'s because Oxford Dictionaries has just named its word of the year for 2014 and it\\'s \"vape.\"  The word, which the Dictionaries\\' blog defines as both a verb and a noun for the whole category of wildly popular tobacco or cannabis atomizing devices, beat out some potent competition. Its rivals included the highly divisive term of endearment \"bae,\" \"indyref\" (a popular hashtag for the Scottish independence referendum), \"contactless\" (as in payments), \"slacktivism\" (i.e., slacker activism) and another weed culture-related noun, \"budtender.\" (Dude, we\\'re, like, sensing a theme here.)  See also: Pimp My Vape: The Rise of E-Cigarette Hackers How big a deal is the Oxford Dictionaries word of the year? Put it this way: LZast year\\'s winner was \"selfie,\" which almost immediately became the name of an ABC sitcom (albeit now a canceled one). In 2012, \"GIF\" just edged out \"YOLO\", prompting an explosion of looped video celebrations.  Those folks at Oxford University Press, in other words, know how to tap a zeitgeist — and to celebrate words that are becoming both ubiquitous and controversial.  \"Vape is also the modifier for other nouns, creating new compound nouns which are growing in popularity,\" the Dictionaries blog post points out. \"The most common of these are vape pen and vape shop, and there is also recent evidence for vape lounge, vape fluid, vape juice, and others. Related coinages include e-juice, carto, and vaporium.\" See also: The Latest \\'Health\\' Craze Is Weed Vaporizers As anyone who owns an e-cigarette knows, the word also represents an increasingly embattled trend. New York became one of several cities to ban indoor vaping earlier this year; local governments across the U.S. are also seeking to ban the sale of the colorful, customizable devices to minors.  But the vape trend seems irreversible, having only gained in strength since Oxford Dictionaries first noticed its usage in 2009 (the editors can even trace the word \"vaping\" all the way back to a 1983 article, though it was then describing the usage of a hypothetical future device). And the growth of anti-vape legislation has been outpaced by a rise in vape retail.  What do you make of this lexical trend? Which words could make the shortlist for 2015\\'s word of the year?

       " \"  It's funny how our mobile devices are anything but mobile when they run low on battery. Instead, we're stuck plugging gadgets into a wall outlet and waiting for them to juice up. But now a Pittsburgh, Pa. startup has designed a creative solution for this #FirstWorldProblem that can even help the developing world. Energy harvesting startup SolePower created a shoe insole prototype that charges portable electronics while you walk, as explained in the video above. This special shoe sole fits in your shoe and a charging wire snakes through your laces. The charging wire plugs into a battery, which is fastened around your ankle or clipped to your shoe. As you walk, the energy from your steps are turned into electrical power that's stored in the battery. The battery can then be plugged into portable electronic devices like cell phones, radios and GPS units. Right now, the sole prototype is rated to last 100 million steps. The goal is to have the soles fully charge an iPhone with 2.5 miles of walking.  SEE ALSO: 7 iPhone Cases That Charge On-The-Go  SolePower began as a design project at Carnegie Mellon University and the team is now continuing development through Pittsburgh-based startup incubator AlphaLab. The startup hopes to help those in developing nations through a buy-one-send-one program. It's not exactly a TOMS Shoes model, but SolePower would allow someone in the U.S. buy two insoles and send one of those to someone in need abroad. SolePower is trying to raise $50,000 on Kickstarter to further develop their prototype and help finalize a product. With still 40 days left to go in the campaign, backers have already pledged more than $13,700. A limited number of backers who pledge at least $100 can be among the first to get the SolePower insole. Beyond the functional purpose of SolePower, it's also great for a little motivation to get active: why not walk and charge your phone while you talk? Would you find a shoe charger useful?

       " ' SEOUL, South Korea — The captain of a ferry that sank earlier this year, leaving more than 300 people dead and shocking South Korea, was given a 36-year prison sentence Tuesday for negligence and abandoning his passengers. The highly anticipated verdict came amid continuing grief and finger-pointing over one of the worst disasters in South Korean history. Family members of the victims, most of whom were teenagers, immediately criticized the sentence for Capt. Lee Joon-seok and other crew members as too lenient, some weeping and shouting during the court proceedings. \"Do you know how many children are dead?\" one relative said, according to a defense lawyer. See also: What Went Wrong Aboard the Sunken South Korean Ferry The Gwangju District Court in southern South Korea acquitted Lee of a homicide charge because it was difficult to believe that he knew his actions would cause such a huge number of deaths, according to a court statement. It said that Lee had issued an evacuation order. The widely vilified Lee could have received a death sentence for the homicide charge. South Korea hasn\\'t executed anyone since late 1997, though its courts occasionally issue the punishment. Lee has apologized for abandoning the passengers, but said he didn\\'t know his actions would lead to so many deaths. The court sentenced the ship\\'s chief engineer to 30 years in prison and 13 others to up to 20 years in prison, the statement said. The engineer, Park Ki-ho, was convicted of the homicide charge because he abandoned two injured colleagues, escaped the ferry and failed to tell rescuers about them, even though he knew they would die without help, the court statement said. The court, however, cleared two other crew members of homicide charges for the same reasoning used to acquit the captain of homicide, the statement said. Those crew members got 15 and 20 years in prison, it said. Prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal, according to the court.  The 15 crew members tasked with navigating the ferry Sewol have faced scathing public criticism because they escaped the sinking ship while many of their passengers were still trapped inside. A total of 476 people were aboard the ship and only 172 were rescued. Most of the dead were teenage students traveling to a resort island on a school trip. Nearly seven months after the sinking, 295 bodies have been recovered but nine are still missing. South Korean officials said Tuesday they\\'ve ended searches for the missing because there was only a remote chance of finding more bodies while worries have grown over the safety of divers. Two civilian divers have died after falling unconscious during searches. \"As our loved ones remain trapped in the cold waters, this decision is unbearably painful for us. But we requested that the search operations be stopped\" because of safety concerns, Min Dong-im, 36, the wife of a missing teacher, tearfully said at a televised news conference. The sinking has prompted widespread grief and a bout of soul-searching about lax safety practices. Authorities blamed overloaded cargo, improper storage, untimely rescue efforts and corruption by the ship\\'s owners that prevented enough spending on safety, along with the crew members\\' behavior, for the sinking. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers approved plans to disband the coast guard and transfer its responsibilities to other government agencies. The coast guard was criticized for unprofessional, slow rescue efforts. Also last week, three relatives of the ship\\'s billionaire owner were sentenced to up to three years in prison, about four months after the tycoon was found dead after he fled the law. Prosecutors have accused the crew members of tacitly colluding to abandon the ship even though they knew that passengers would be trapped and killed after it sank. The defense in the trial has denied any collusion among the crew members, saying they were confused, injured and panicked. Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn\\'t remember any evacuation order being given before they helped each other flee the vessel. Lee has said he issued an evacuation order for passengers. But he initially told reporters days after his arrest that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for the passengers\\' safety in the cold, swift waters.

Many economists expect the rate to continue to rise as the market takes into account possible inflation brought on by economic growth. These things get complex very quickly, but simply put, the 10-Year is the most influential bond in the world, similar to the weight of the U.S. dollar among other currencies. It influences a wide variety of rates including how much interest people have to pay on the mortgage on a house. Because of the central role of these bonds and the perceived security of U.S. credit, the bonds also serve as a bellwether for economic conditions. In times of struggle, such as the last few years, rates drop as investors seek the safety of U.S. bonds. But when the economy improves, investors begin to withdraw from these areas in hopes of investing their money in something that will generate greater returns.  Think of these bonds as umbrellas. When it's stormy, people forgo buying other things for an umbrella to wait out the rain. But when the weather improves, people sell their umbrellas or stop buying them and begin purchasing other things. Market watchers tend to be (somewhat) good at predicting the upcoming weather, so when they start selling their umbrellas, people take it as a sign that sunnier days are ahead. One important note — a critical reader might ask why rates going up would mean less demand for bonds. This is a sharp question in a slightly confusing area that is best left for the end. Bond rates move inversely to prices. In stormy economic conditions, greater demand drives the prices for bonds up as more investors compete for the limited supply. As a result, the yield falls to offset the price rise. This Investopedia link goes more in depth on the topic.  Image: Getty Images North America \",\n",
       " ' Thanks to two solar flares that occurred in rapid succession late this week, a widespread and potentially vivid display of the Northern Lights is possible for many parts of the U.S. and Canada. This could include parts of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest, including cities such as Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Missouri, and Portland, Oregon. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which monitors space weather, has issued a G3 or \"strong\" geomagnetic storm watch for Friday, due to the combined influence of two coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, that were associated with the solar flares. See also: Strong Solar Storm Will Hit Earth Starting Thursday Night, Scientists Say \"The second of the expected coronal mass ejections (CMEs) has arrived, and arrived in good agreement with the predicted arrival times. As expected, an initial look shows this CME is stronger than the first. G2 (Moderate) storming is underway now and the forecast for G3 (Strong) storming on the 13th still looks reasonable,\" said NOAA\\'s Space Weather Prediction Center on its website on Friday.  Coronal mass ejections, which are essentially magnetic clouds ejected at high velocity from the sun, can affect the electricity grid, radio transmissions and GPS signals, among other things, when they interact with the planet\\'s magnetic field. This event is not expected to cause significant disruptions, and instead could create a significant display of the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis.  The Aurora is notoriously difficult to predict, but the best bet for seeing them is to get away from urban lights, and look, well, north, late at night on Friday night into Saturday morning. On Thursday night, when the solar storm was weaker than it will be Friday, the Aurora was observed as far south as New Mexico, based on Twitter reports.  Beautiful #aurora are coming back. A welcome return indeed! pic.twitter.com/8LG7FACAFP — Reid Wiseman (@astro_reid) September 12, 2014  The Capital Weather Gang blog recommends checking the \"K\" index, which helps predict Aurora activity, before heading out the door. K indices above a seven typically mean there is a good chance of Northern Lights in the area. As of 6 p.m., the estimated 3-hour Planetary Kp-index was at about a 5.  Another website to look at when planning your Northern Lights spotting is the University of Alaska\\'s Aurora forecasts, although that site was experiencing some hiccups as of 6 p.m. ET.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Your Facebook friends list, as Mashable revealed last week, is not as private as it claims to be. Setting your list privacy to \"Only Me\" doesn\\'t actually mean that nobody can see who you\\'re connected to, because there\\'s a loophole anyone can exploit. The loophole comes in the shape of Facebook\\'s mutual friends feature. Any user can see the mutual friends between any two other users, so long as one of them has a publicly available friends list. So if you keep your friends list private, but your best friend doesn\\'t, a third party could compare your two lists, and voilà — they\\'d be able to see all the friends the two of you have in common. See also: Your Private Facebook Friends List Isn\\'t Actually That Private This feature has been in place at Facebook for some time. The company doesn\\'t see it as a problem, and warns users that the privacy of their Friends List is actually dependent on the privacy settings of their connections. But to show how much of a problem it can be, an online security group called CyberInt built a program last week intended to exploit the feature and reconstruct users\\' private friends lists.  You can set your Facebook friends list visibility to Only Me although others can still see your mutual connections. Image: FacebookThe mutual friends tool is a byproduct of the company\\'s mission to connect the whole world on the platform; the company believes it helps to see which friends you share with other users. But it doesn\\'t afford users as much privacy as they might think they have. To prove that, we put the mutual friends feature to the test with the most famous Facebook user of all: founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg keeps his friends list private, but he is also friends with longtime Facebook employee and head of product Chris Cox, whose friends list is public. Cox and Zuckerberg have 248 shared connections, and thanks to that fact (and further friends list comparisons) we were able to see more than 400 of Zuckerberg\\'s Facebook friends. Not surprisingly, Zuckerberg is friends with many of Silicon Valleys most prominent tech icons, including dozens of CEOs and VCs and fellow billionaires. It definitely doesn\\'t come as a shock to see Facebook board members like Marc Andreessen and Don Graham, and early employees such as Napster co-founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker, on the list. But there were also surprises. Included amongst Zuckerberg\\'s list of friends: Robin Li, cofounder of Chinese search engine Baidu, and China\\'s third richest man ($11.1 billion net worth, according to Forbes). Here are some more intriguing names we uncovered:  Alison Pincus, Cofounder of home decor marketplace One King\\'s Lane (and wife of Zynga cofounder Mark Pincus) Barry Diller, Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, media executive Ben Horowitz, Cofounder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz Biz Stone, Cofounder of Twitter, CEO and founder of Jelly Blake Ross, Co-creator of Mozilla Firefox Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb Charlie Cheever, Cofounder of Quora Dave Goldberg, CEO of SurveyMokey (and Sandberg\\'s husband) Dennis Crowley, CEO of Foursquare Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox Ev Williams, CEO of Medium, Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey, CEO and founder of Square, Twitter cofounder Jack Xu, Co-president and CTO at SINA (owns Sina Weibo, China\\'s version of Twitter) Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp John Donahoe, President and CEO of eBay Keith Rabois, Venture Capitalist at Khosla Ventures Marc Andreessen, Cofounder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and Facebook board member Qi Lu, Executive VP at Microsoft Robin Li, CEO and cofounder at Chinese search company Baidu (China\\'s third richest man) Scott Sassa, Former CEO of Friendster Sean Parker, Cofounder of Napster, early President at Facebook Trip Adler, CEO and cofounder of Scribd  You can\\'t see a connection if both users hide their friends list, as is the case with Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. We assume the two are friends, but you can\\'t tell by using the mutual friends search. Zuckerberg\\'s full friends list likely features even more intriguing tech connections. Still, the list is a relatively in-depth look at the personal and professional connections of one of Silicon Valley\\'s most powerful CEOs — and if Facebook doesn\\'t believe the friends list loophole is a problem, then Facebook has to be okay with everyone in the world knowing who Zuckerberg is connected to. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on Zuckerberg\\'s friends list, but did share a statement about the mutual friends tool in general. \"A friendship includes two people, and we give each of those people control over who they share their friends lists with. Of course, friends sometimes disagree on things, maybe even when it comes to who they share things with on Facebook... That\\'s why we not only give people control over who can see their friends list on their Timeline, but we explain prominently that their friends also get to choose who they share with and that they might select a different set of people.\" Facebook has not shared any plans to change this mutual friends tool. Unless it does, users should understand that their friends list is just as visible as Zuckerberg\\'s with a bit of digging — even if they set it to be seen by \"only me.\" ',\n",
       " ' Somewhere, there is a line between antihero and outright villain – and it’s not a fine line. It’s a broad fuzzy band that shifts from character to character and viewer to viewer, and Hollywood has been messing with it lately, drawing it and erasing it and drawing it again. On Friday night in Toronto, a couple of first-time directors took distinctively different – but equally successful – swipes at the increasingly popular archetype, with world premiers of Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, and St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray, on “Bill Murray Day.” See also: Bill Murray Spotted in the Rain, Greeting Fans at Toronto Film Fest Nightcrawler The high-velocity Los Angeles noir thriller Nightcrawler gives our understanding of “antihero” a disorienting punch in the face with Lou Bloom, a six-exits-past-the-borderline sociopath whose half-baked moral code, naively blunt observations of human nature and dogged work ethic almost make you want to root for this lunatic, played by what was left of Gyllenhaal after a jolting weight-loss binge. This is not Walter White becoming devilishly self-aware of his true motivations, or even Taxi Driver wacko Travis Bickle, whose twisted desire to “cleanse” the mean streets of New York is rooted in, well – something. No, Gyllenhaal’s Bloom is merely out for himself, single-mindedly chasing an outlet for his focus and ambition – but when he finds it, boy oh boy is he fun to watch in action. Bloom shows his stripes early, conking out a night watchman to steal scrap metal and swiping the guard’s timepiece for good measure. On his way home from peddling the score, he stumbles upon a crew of nightcrawlers, the freelance cameramen who roam Los Angeles after dark to capture footage of L.A.’s tiny catastrophes, which they then sell to local news stations.  A light goes on – in Bloom’s case, a tiny camcorder light – and a monster is born. He swaps a boosted bike for a police scanner and some crude recording gear, and within a few nights it’s clear that he’s cut out for this, as he’ll do what even seasoned nightcrawlers won’t: cross under police tape, enrage officers without flinching, trespass on private property … even drag a crash victim’s body into the glow of the headlights for a better shot. It seems there’s nothing Bloom won’t do to claw his way into the business that was perfectly despicable enough before he came along. Maybe with any lesser an actor than Gyllenhaal, or a backdrop less ambition-driven than Los Angeles, Bloom would just be another heartless paparazzi, a scavenger to be reviled, which would make Nightcrawler nothing more than yet another finger in the crowd, wagging at the media. But here’s the thing: With every one of Bloom’s appalling actions, which ratchet up from scene to scene, the audience at the packed Princess of Wales Theatre was laughing gut-busting, knee-slapping belly laughs. Though that may sound like entirely the wrong reaction for a film about the disgusting forces that feed our disgusting obsession with everyday mayhem, it wasn’t.  It’s exactly the reaction that Gilroy and Gyllenhaal were going for.  Producer Tony Gilroy, Producer Jake Gyllenhaal and Director/Writer Dan Gilroy seen at Open Road Films\\' World Premier of \\'Nightcrawler\\' at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 5, 2014. Image: Eric Charbonneau/Associated PressHerein lies the brilliance of Nightcrawler: It has a critical eye, but it’s not preachy. It’s dark and moody, but never broods. What’s unfolding onscreen is sick and sensational, and yet it delights us – but it neither revels in that delight, nor does it shame us for feeling it. In that sense, Nightcrawleris a high-wire act — and at its conclusion, Gilroy and Gyllenhaal rip the balance bar out of our hands and give the wire a good, hard shove when Bloom crosses a line that journalism ethics, the law, and a basic sense of humanity firmly assert should not be crossed.  It’s a gone-too-far moment that tests what little sympathy we have left for the protagonist. There’s no doubt that many had given up rooting for Bloom at the moment he decided to join the paparazzi, and his third-act choices probably lose all but the most unhinged among us.  But there is something about his singularity of purpose, the clarity of his vision and his level of dedication that’s hard not to want for ourselves. If you were as driven to do whatever it is you do as Bloom is to beat the competition and get the best possible shot, you’d be a lot further along in your career. Is Bloom an antihero? Or just a psychopath gone off the rails? I see admirable qualities in him, and many will disagree; but whether he’s an anti-hero or an outright Black Hat, Nightcrawler is an even more entertaining ride-along than End of Watch, another fine piece on Gyllenhaal’s resume, and with a character whose motivations are infinitely more pure. St. Vincent  You’ve seen the basic story of St. Vincent before: Crusty old person is forced into partnership with young whippersnapper, both parties learn and grow, pop tissues and roll credits. But St. Vincent has something that all those movies don’t: Bill Murray. As a comedian, a dramatic actor, and a person, Murray has gotten so far under our skin that there’s no overused, nauseatingly hyperbolic word that doesn’t fit him: I’m OK with “icon,” because Murray truly represents something – both the lightness and darkness of human nature, the sadness and absurdity of our modern world; but he’s also a rallying point, something we can all agree is good and right. And “legend” is OK with me, too — he’s been doing this for so long that a generation is just now discovering Murray’s talent and place in the entertainment cosmos, and will never really understand where it all came from, except through the telling of their elders. Murray brings all of that to bear in St. Vincent, which is not in and of itself a great film, but it is a Great Bill Murray Film. And really, that’s all it needed to be great.  Actors Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy arrive at the \"St. Vincent\" premier during the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, Sept. 5, 2014. Image: Evan Agostini/Associated PressAs Vincent de Van Nuys, a broken and boozy misanthrope, Murray is craggy and all out of hope, running out the clock on life. (You can almost imagine Murray like this in his private life, which is one of the great mysteries of modern entertainment enigmas, since he doesn’t really do press, or have any representation of any kind. For all we know, when he’s not making movies, Murray retreats to some grimy row house on an out-of-the-way street, crawls into a bottle of bourbon and watches reruns of The Golden Girls. OK probably not, but you get what I mean.) Vin gets passed-out-drunk, he chain smokes, he gambles, he steals, he snarls at everyday people to make them feel bad about themselves, he sleeps with a pregnant prostitute and doesn’t pay her on time, he dodges his bookie – and when he’s forced to look after the little kid who just moved next door, he leverages it to his every advantage. He’s Bad Grandpa but without the blood relation to check his conscience.  He is not a nice man. All of this is played to good comedic effect, and along the way, St. Vincent predictably begins to chip away at the curmudgeon to reveal a man who, unlike Gyllenhaal’s purely selfish, ambitious Bloom, is actually capable of making sacrifices for others, of feeling empathy, of being human. But this is not purely a redemption story: Every time Murray’s Vin is cleansed in the goodness of a plucky child, a struggling single mom and a hooker who kind of likes him, he does something to renew the stain, and we start over. Unlike Gyllenhaal’s Bloom, who never pays for his indiscretions because he feels no regret, Murray’s antihero suffers, and we suffer with him. But is that because of the character, or is it because of Murray? To me, it’s the latter – and that’s why Murray was uniquely suited for this role. Throw in Billy Bob Thornton, or even Jack Nicholson (who Murray joked was the first choice for the role), and Vin is just a shameful, broken-down old drunk who acts like a human being once in awhile in spite of himself. Everybody has feelings about Murray, and to leverage those feelings onscreen, in a way that’s just so, is a tricky thing to do. Especially when you’re dealing with a hero who’s as “anti” as Vincent de Van Nuys. ',\n",
       " ' A New York City auction house is selling a watch believed to be used to mark the time of a historic moment in United States history: the death of President John F. Kennedy. The watch belonged to Dr. Kemp Clark, a former neurosurgeon at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, who declared Kennedy dead on Nov. 22, 1963, at 1 p.m. CST. The listing for the Patek Philippe wristwatch on Christie\\'s website states the auction ends on Dec. 17, and the artifact is expected to fetch more than $100,000.  See also: Exclusive Preview: A Look Inside the Life of JFK \"There is endless debate among historians on the actual time of death and there was most likely also a clock in the ER,\" John Reardon, Christie\\'s international co-head of watches, told the Associated Press. \"However, the family and historians agree to these facts: the watch was on [Clark\\'s] wrist that day and he called the time of death and signed the death certificate.\" Clark, who died in 2007, filled out and signed Kennedy\\'s death certificate, according to his own testimony from several months after Kennedy\\'s assassination. Clark makes no mention of the watch in this testimony. \"This was an approximation as it is, first, extremely difficult to stage precisely when death occurs,\" Clark\\'s testimony reads. \"Secondly, no one was monitoring the clock, so an approximation of 1 o\\'clock was chosen.\" Dilworth Hager, Clark\\'s mother, bought the watch for him as a gift for 1290 Swiss Francs in 1949, according to the Christie\\'s listing. Clark\\'s name is engraved on its back. Clark\\'s family is selling the watch, which they say he used throughout his medical career. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Red Cross, the AP reports. Below is a photo of the watch and relevant documents provided to Mashable by Christie\\'s.

The fact that one of the most famous gadget nerds on the planet doesn\\'t have fast Internet access is shocking enough. But why would his slow bandwidth make him brush off Apple\\'s latest gadget?

Once he learned about the device (he was on a plane when Apple\\'s keynote was in progress), he said, he emailed his wife to tell her he didn\\'t want one.  Although Apple offers a 128GB version of the iPad, one of the largest storage options for a non-Windows tablet, that\\'s apparently not enough for Woz. His Internet connection probably doesn\\'t allow for streaming, and downloads take an excruciatingly long time. \"I can\\'t order a movie from iTunes and watch it straight away,\" said Wozniak. \"I could wait for it but I get bored by then. It\\'s because of my lousy phone company, but that is life.\" Lousy connectivity wasn\\'t always a fact of life for Wozniak. Before broadband, he had a 1MB connection, he revealed, and was \"king of the hill.\" While broadband is scarce in many rural areas, Wozniak could always turn to satellite Internet services from Dish and others that provide comparable speeds (data caps apply, however).

White House officials and the man\\'s family on Friday confirmed he was U.S. citizen Peter Kassig. \"We can confirm that U.S. citizen Peter Kassig is being held by ISIL,\" said NSC Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden, using the White House\\'s preferred acronym for the Islamic State. \"At this point we have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the video ... we will continue to use every tool at our disposal — military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence -– to try to bring Peter home to his family.\" See also: The Woman Who Escaped the Islamic State Kassig, reportedly a former U.S. Army Ranger who served in the Iraq War, is seen kneeling in a desert setting donning the orange jumpsuit shown in previous hostage videos. The masked militant threatens to behead Kassig, directing this message to President Obama: \"We continue to strike the necks of your people.\"  Peter Kassig was identified by the Islamic State in this video posted on October 3.No information on Kassig\\'s abduction had been released to the media prior to the posting of the video, which shows the killing of British aid worker Alan Henning. But two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had confirmed that Kassig was being held by ISIS. The officials declined to elaborate, the Associated Press reported. Peter Kassig\\'s family say he was taken Oct. 1, 2013 near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, according to the BBC\\'s Middle East Bureau Chief Paul Danahar. They have maintained silence at the wish of those who have held their son, Danahar reports. \"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning,\" the family said in a statement. \"We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration. We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe.\" Kassig\\'s parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, released a video message on Saturday. In it, they describe Kassig\\'s humanitarian work in Syria.  \"Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life — no matter who is responsible,\" Paul says. \"We know that the Syrians are suffering. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all. There is so much that is beyond our control. We\\'ve asked our government to change its actions, but like our son, we have no more control over the U.S. government than you have over the breaking of dawn.\" \"We implore his captors to show mercy and to use their power to let our son go,\" he adds. Paula then addresses her son directly, saying, \"Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return.\"  Kassig served in Iraq in 2007 before going on to become a certified emergency medical technician. He later volunteered in Lebanon, providing medical aid during a temporary trip to the region.  Before his capture, he was known to be working as an aid worker as part of an organization he had founded that delivered medical supplies to conflict zones in the Middle East.  Peter Kassig can be seen delivering aid in this undated photo from the website of his aid organization.Image:  Peter KassigIn a 2012 interview with CNN, Kassig described why he became an aid worker. \"I am not a doctor,\" he said. \"I am not a nurse. But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people\\'s quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose.\" According to SERA\\'s website, Kassig founded the organization in 2012. The \"medically-oriented emergency relief organization\" focuses on providing assistance to refugee populations and internally displaced persons in Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.  Photo of Peter Kassig posted to the site of his aid organization shows him provided assistance in the Middle East.Image:  Peter KassigKassig had decided to volunteer in the dangerous region and work directly with the population of Syria to bring assistance to those in need, he said on a  fundraising page for his group.  I am a veteran of the Iraq war who is living in Beirut working to provide relief for refugees of the Syrian crisis. When I first started this cause to help those in need, I was on my own but I saw first hand the shortages in available resources and supplies for people who were suffering in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey as a result of the violence...This is what led me to create SERA, an organization which is designed to be a front line, grassroots NGO that works directly with the populations it serves..and we need YOUR help. I felt that more could be done to help people and that the most effective way to bring assistance was through a close connection to those who were in desperate need, by meeting them where they were. I also felt that through a personal relationship and a small yet efficient organization, I could offer people a high level of transparency and integrity in the ways I used funding and the activities that SERA engages in to help people.  We may not have much but I have always felt that the reasons why you do something are as important as what you do. This is about making a difference not just through material goods, but also the exchange of ideas and experiences that the international community benefits from through this type of initiative.   As of Friday, SERA has temporarily ceased operations \"due to the present security situation in Syria,\" according to its website.  Representatives of the organization could not be reached for comment.  Additional reporting by Brian Ries and Anita Li.  ',\n",

       " ' Social can be one of the most challenging platforms for brands to measure return on investment. Companies that grew up on traditional advertising and metrics often have trouble making sense of the value of the online ecosystem. But with\\xa052% of U.S. consumers using the web as their primary purchase tool, it\\'s an area brands can\\'t afford to ignore. See also: Advice for Clueless Brands on Social Media Last week the commenting and social curation platform Livefyre hosted an evening chat with a handful of influential analysts, marketers and publishers, sharing thoughts on need-to-know ROI growth tools. It\\'s a formula Forrester Senior Analyst Kim Celestre\\xa0calls \"social depth,\" a fancy phrase for discovering, exploring and engaging with online consumers, eventually leading those conversations back to brands\\' websites. Here\\'s the social depth formula broken down into five, easy tips. 1.\\xa0Engage User-generated content, blog posts, videos, tweets and chatter are all over the web. Harnessing the power of brand advocates, addressing customer concerns and fixing problems empowers participation.\\xa0It\\'s easier to put out a fire than it is to ignore it. People want to interact and create relationships with brands online. Catering to those fans via product giveaways, social interaction and real replies separate the companies that get it from the ones still in the dark. \"The consumer is boss, so we have to match that,\" explains Andrew Backs, P&G\\'s manager for\\xa0global business development. \"Look for solutions to unlock the consumer voice.\" 2. Be Authentic You can\\'t fake it online,\\xa0says Sid Shuman, who runs social media for Sony Playstation. \"They can smell that a mile away.\" The same die-hard brand advocates championing your product will be the first to call out shady behavior or content that doesn\\'t reflect brand culture. When in doubt, ask your community for help when it comes to content. Shuman\\xa0suggests crowdsourcing content for in-house interview and articles. Because they live and breathe the brand, fans \"come up with better questions that we could any day,\" he says. 3. Keep Content Premium Hitting \"publish\" is social suicide if the material isn\\'t quality. Take advantage of Wordpress, Tumblr and social media to craft strong messages. Know the rules and follow them: Every network requires a specific approach and language (tweets are written differently than Facebook posts). See also: 8 Creative Ways to Connect With Customers on Facebook Stick to a calendar for posting, and focus on making followers feel part of the brand\\'s family. Using platforms solely as selling tools quickly alienates customers. Hire professionals—and fight the urge to turn sites into content farms or automate feeds. Peter Yared, CBS Interactive\\'s CTO/CIO suggests using your sites to curate and amplify positive content about your company. \"Find the interesting content that’s being posted and use it to bring value to your audience.\" 4. Integrate Real-Time Apps Incorporate social into every aspect of what you do, says Jordan Kretchmer, Livefyre\\'s founder and chief executive. Kretchmer\\'s\\xa0company reports 88% of businesses using\\xa0Twitter feeds, comments, ratings and reviews on homepages increases user engagement.

       " '  Forget the upcoming Ashton Kutcher film. It\\'s all about Justin Long and his performance in iSteve, Funny or Die\\'s new Steve Jobs biopic that debuted Wednesday. If you worship the cult of Mac, drop everything you\\'re doing and spend the next 78 minutes watching\\xa0this. (For a teaser, check out the video below.)  iSteve feels like the 2.0 version of This Is Spinal Tap — only much geekier and very tongue-in-cheek. \"What\\'s that? You want to hear my story,\" a bearded Jobs asks at the beginning of the film. Throughout the Skywalker-esque tale, Jobs moves from (sort of) humble tech wannabe to befuddled tech god. The journey begins in the mountains of India, as a fresh-faced Jobs leaves Mountain View in search of Eastern answers. Jobs has trouble explaining his obsession with computers to a guru, who subsequently shows him his life path: Make computers easy to understand. \"If there was a man who could make computers simple, the entire world would listen to him,\" the guru says, before giving Jobs what resembles acid tabs to make him think differently and see the future. \"Do it when you need it to see the real future for you.\" Jobs returns to Northern California where he \"feels the benevolent hand of the cosmos every time he gazes upon some elegant\" typeface. The young Jobs soon meets the larger-than-life Steve Wozniak, his neighbor. They bond over their mutual first names, as well as their love for jetpacks and flying cars. \"It is a little depressing knowing everything that\\'s going to be invented,\" Wozniak says. \"We\\'re the ones who decide what the future\\'s going to look like,\" the Jobs character says. Soon after, Jobs pulls out his guru\\'s acid tab and drops it. Everything changes. Two hours later, he comes back with a vision of the first home micro-computing system. And voila, Apple is born. \"My God, it\\'s so crazy it might work,\" Jobs says post-trip. \"Don\\'t be afraid Woz, you can do it.\" The twosome build the system, which lays the foundation for Apple. Soon, Jobs churns out his first computers and expands from a garage office to serious Silicon Valley digs. As the \"genius\" label and product hype become widespread, Apple the brand catches on like cocaine in the disco era.  \"And like that, my beta days were over,\" Jobs says in a voiceover.  Without spoiling too much, the film is a fantastic — albeit largely fictionalized — account of the history of Apple and the man who helped build it. If you\\'re looking for facts, iSteve isn\\'t the movie for you. But if you want to see a feather-ruffling portrayal of the birth of Apple, its products and even the Steve Jobs-Bill Gates rivalry, check it out. For diehard Mac\\xa0aficionados,\\xa0the liberties iSteve takes with actual events may be akin to\\xa0sacrilege, but it\\'s all in good fun. Hate it or love it, tell us your thoughts in the comments.

       " '    Separatists Near Donetsk Airport         Separatists and armed locals were on the move during a battle with Ukrainian forces near the Donetsk airport on Monday.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          Black smoke could be seen rising from the airport, where government forces used airstrikes in an attempt to rout militants who had seized it.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          The fighting was not limited to the airport grounds; separatists were also positioned in nearby neighborhoods.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          Some rebels took up positions behind trees in residential areas.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          At least one separatist was wounded in the exchanges of gunfire.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          As the militiamen moved through neighborhoods near the airport, military aircraft could be heard overhead.  Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman          Some local citizens also took up arms along with the separatists.

Image:  Mashable, Evgeny Feldman       UPDATED: 12:05 p.m. ET DONETSK, Ukraine — Ukraine government forces launched an aggressive assault Monday on pro-Russian separatists who had earlier seized a terminal building in the Donetsk airport.  The government forces used airstrikes and helicopters to battle the insurgents, not long after President-elect Petro Peroshenko vowed to take a tougher approach to the armed militants who have seized government buildings in a succession of cities in the Russian-speaking eastern part of the nation.  See also: Ukraine\\'s New President: Can a Candy King Lead a Post-Revolutionary Nation? The seizure of the airport posed the first immediate challenge to Poroshenko, coming only a day after his overwhelming victory at the polls. Judging by his words and the government\\'s military response at the Donetsk airport, he intends to take a more aggressive tack against the pro-Russian fighters. “I am not going to hold any dialogues with the criminals. You don’t talk to terrorists,” he said at a press conference on Monday. “The anti-terrorist operation will not and cannot last for months, it will last just for hours.” The Ukraine government also clearly recognizes the strategic importance of the airport. It was only a few months ago that pro-Russian fighters seized the main airport in Simferapol, Crimea, the first step in Russia\\'s eventual takeover of that small part of Ukraine. Russia subsequently used the airport to send in reinforcements.  A pro-Russian militant at the airport in Donetsk, Ukraine, on Monday.Image: Alexander Khudoteply/AFP/Getty ImagesThe standoff at the Donetsk airport began at 3 a.m. local time on Monday when separatists stormed the terminal, saying they wanted Ukrainian troops to leave both the airport and the region. Three buses carrying more separatists arrived at 10 a.m. to reinforce the first group.  Separatists seized the Donetsk airport on Monday, halting flights and demanding that Ukrainian troops leave.Image: Alexander Khudoteply/AFP/Getty ImagesBy 2 p.m., bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard for at least 30 minutes. At least three Ukrainian helicopters were flying overhead, along with two fighter jets that were releasing anti-missile flares.  One helicopter fired at and destroyed a rebel anti-aircraft gun, according to Vladislav Seleznev, a Ukraine military spokesperson. Seleznev said the military had launched an airstrike against the separatists after they rejected an ultimatum, the Associated Press reported.  Around 3 p.m., Ukrainian forces went on the offensive. Bursts of gunfire punctuated by mortar and RPG blasts echoed through the area. Government forces pushed the militia south into a residential area less than a quarter mile from the city\\'s central train station.  Rebels and Ukrainian troops exchanged gunfire from their positions behind trees and bus stops.  At least one rebel was injured and carried to a car and driven away. One civilian - a parking attendant - was killed by stray bullet. The person\\'s identity was unknown.  Smoke was seen rising from the Donetsk airport on Monday.By nightfall, fighting was continuing, according to Reuters. Separatist leader Denis Pushilin said, \"It\\'s a full-blown military standoff.\"  Pushilin earlier declared martial law in the Donetsk region at midnight on Monday, vowing to push the Ukrainian military out by brute force should they not leave voluntarily. The clash in Donetsk developed mere hours after Poroshenko claimed victory as Ukraine\\'s president, becoming the first elected leader of the nation since Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February. Poroshenko, a billionaire oligarch who visibly supported the Euromaidan uprising that led to Yanukovych\\'s removal, won well over 50 percent of the vote; former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko placed a distant second.  In his first post-election press conference, Poroshenko vowed both to intensify military efforts against armed separatists in the east and to hold peace talks with Russia as well, according to the Kyiv Post news site.  His election brought conciliatory words from Moscow as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said,  \"We are ready for dialogue with Kiev\\'s representatives, with Petro Poroshenko.\" ',\n",
       " ' It has been three days since the devastating bombings at the Boston marathon. No suspects have been named or are in custody. The web has begun to consume itself, gnawing on its own tail in search of comfort and answers. Until authorities find the bastards who did this, it should be a harmless exercise. But it’s not. As I write this, Reddit users are frantically trying to stamp out a fire they started. What seemed like a good idea at the time — crowdsourcing an investigation of video and photo forensic evidence — has spun out of control. A recent post on the site gives you an idea of where things are:  “the two Males that the media have claimed the FBI are looking for are local guys and appear to be innocent. PLEASE DO NOT POST ANY MORE ON THEM, ESPECIALLY LINKS TO NEWS SITES THAT IDENTIFIES THEM.  Since shortly after the bombings occurred at the finish line of the Boston marathon Monday, Redditors have used the subreddit “FindBostonBombers” to examine countless images for clues. As a public event, there’s probably a far greater supply of amateur photos, videos, Instagrams and even Vines that can tell authorities something about the tragic event. In fact, that was one of my first questions that day. I worried about how people could get their media to the FBI. YouTube quickly set up a space for people to upload videos. This was a good and very smart move. On Reddit, however, you can see the problem almost immediately. From another post in the subreddit:  Image overlay of white hat and blue jogging suit suspects standing at Ground Zero  What’s wrong with that post? The use of the word “suspect.” For some Redditors, everyone in these photos is a potential suspect, and they’re quickly targeting people and then launching social media investigations.  Don’t get me wrong, the subreddit is fascinating: images and ideas about what happened and who might have done what, but it’s all conjecture. If you were at the Boston marathon wearing a cap or a hoodie, a backpack (a lot of people wear them; I do every day), or look in any way suspicious, these Redditors were ready to name you a suspect. The Flip-Side The beauty of Reddit though is its facility for self-correction. Within hours of the launch of FindTheBombers, Redditors were calling on their compatriots (or hornets\\' nest of amateur detectives) to chill out:   This shit needs to slow down and accusations should be based in unimpeachable piles of evidence. From my perspective we currently know very, very little. … In order to point out a viable suspect we need evidence connecting a person or group to both locations, and in possession of a suspicious backpack. We\\'re missing what we need to do this, all we can do at this point is wait for more info, or wait for the FBI to work it out. I know, you want to figure it out before they do, but we\\'re facing a serious drought of evidence here.  And to a certain extent, Redditors have supported this idea. Here’s what interests me about those comments, though: the Redditor said the goal was to identify the perpetrator “before they do.” \"They\" being law enforcement. There’s a bit of gamesmanship about all this, which leads to my second point. All the World’s a Game Reddit went into overdrive trying to catch these monsters before the FBI. Meanwhile, the media was playing a different game of \"First.\" As I mentioned earlier, there are, at the time of this writing, still no official suspects nor is anyone in custody. But for a few hours Wednesday, social media, primarily Twitter, was bursting with conflicting information about whether the FBI had anyone in custody. CNN kicked it off by inaccurately reporting the FBI had collared a suspect.  Social media did the rest. No one wants to be the second source to share this information, so thousands on social media, mostly Twitter, began sharing the news. It took almost an hour and a half for CNN to reverse its earlier report. The FBI even put out a statement begging the media to \"exercise caution.\" Up until that moment, Twitter was a sea of confusion. Tweets stating suspects were in custody were followed by ones stating that information was untrue, only to be followed by others insisting it was.  According to CNN an arrest has been made in the Boston Bombings. Fox in Boston says suspect was caught on store surveillance video. — FOX Baltimore (@FOXBaltimore) April 17, 2013   Get it together @cnn, sources. #BostonMarathon bombing suspect not in custody: wjla.com/articles/2013/… via @abc7news — Melanie Coburn (@melanietc) April 17, 2013  Almost the same thing had happened right after the bombings, when there were reports that authorities had a wounded Saudi national in custody.  While police did question the man, he was never a suspect. Nevertheless #Saudi instantly became a top trend on Twitter. Right, Not First With emotions still high, and in this near-complete vacuum of information, I understand how misinformation rushes in to fill the void. But we have to realize how damaging it can be.  People lost their lives in this tragedy — more than 150 were wounded — but others can easily be ruined if we aren\\'t careful. If we aren’t sure. Social media is a fantastic platform for instant news and information-sharing, but that news is often as not almost instantly buried in a cascade of distortions and sometimes outright lies. All this said, I’m not advocating Reddit stop searching, but let’s not make it about beating the FBI. If Redditors do find something, share it directly with the FBI, not the collective, or at least do not share a single name, Twitter account, MySpace or Facebook page.  Obviously, a truth filter on Twitter is a fanciful panacea for all the misinformation, but in reality, I just want everyone to apply a little restraint.

       " ' HBO\\'s Girls has achieved what every TV show dreams of: A network of connected fans who love to share their opinions about the show, compare themselves to the lead characters — Are you a Hannah, Marnie, Jessa or Shoshana? — and tweet with the show\\'s signature hashtag introduced before the season one premiere #mistakesGIRLSmake. The HBO dramedy about four young friends figuring out life in New York City, now entering its second season, instantly drew comparisons to Sex and the City, its HBO Sunday night predecessor by more than a decade. Comparing and contrasting the two shows is fruit for many lively discussions (be they in high school cafeterias, sorority dining rooms or at happy hour counters). But something major has changed since (the first time) Carrie Bradshaw graced the cable airwaves. Girls fans of today have a different bond with the show\\'s characters than SATC fans could have imagined. They connect with the shows characters on their mobile phones while waiting for the bus and in their Twitter feeds while distracted at work.  HBO\\'s marketing team has used social media to transform the show\\'s four leading ladies from characters you watch for 30-minutes on TV (or perhaps, on your laptop using your parents\\' HBO Go account) to friends you see in your Instagram feed that make you giggle as you \"double tap\" your love.  While you could argue the entrance of all TV shows into the social networking space has changed the relationship of viewers and characters, HBO\\'s VP of Social Media and Marketing Sabrina Caluori explains that Girls fans\\' own behavior has driven the show\\'s marketing. The over-sharing phenomenon is a marketing team\\'s bread and butter. Caluori told Mashable, \"We\\'re totally inspired by the fan behavior.\" When we look at all the different social platforms that are out there, we look at what the fans are doing naturally. The GIF behavior on Tumblr was there long before we ever were, and in a way that felt really germane to that platform.\"  That GIF behavior ultimately fueled the creation of the \"What Should We Call Girls\" Tumblr blog, officially launched by HBO in December. The blog aggregates animated GIFs combining scenes and memorable quotations from the show. While HBO curates the blog, the GIFs are fan generated.   The energy of fans has kept the show\\'s accounts active in the seven months since the season one finale. \"When we start work on a show we discuss whether it has a fan base that will stay engaged year round without trying to forcefeed people to sustain it,\" Caluori says. \"With Girls, in addition to content around the show, it\\'s such a lifestyle in and of itself. The community is about more than just the show, it\\'s the music, the fashion, New York, the locations. Even though there was a finite number of episodes, you feel Girls all around you all the time.\"  Beyond the non-seasonal nature of its social accounts, HBO has made the Girls characters staples of its fans social media lives by integrating fans\\' own lives into its feeds. HBO will call for and subsequently share fans\\' resolutions and mistakes, using both the original #mistakesGIRLSmake and season two\\'s #resolutionsGIRLSbreak. Likewise, HBO will call for favorite mistakes, quotations and hypothetical resolutions from the shows\\' characters. The hypothetical resolutions have also been at the heart of the show\\'s paid marketing campaigns. For the season two premiere Sunday, HBO won\\'t be promoting hashtags on Twitter, but will be using the hashtag #resolutionsGIRLSbreak, which it\\'s used throughout season two promotion, and the hashtag #GIRLSathon during the season one marathon, playing on HBO starting at 4 p.m. Sunday. (During the season one premiere, HBO promoted three different hashtags, #GIRLSnight, #mistakesGIRLSmake and #GIRLSonHBO.)  \"Girls is a younger skewing show for HBO, and its fans are more adept at creating user-generated content,\" Caluori says. \"It\\'s a beautiful thing about working on Girls: When you have a creator that understands social media in the way Lena [Dunham] does, and she\\'s encouraged us from day one, and really trusted us.\" Though Girls has consistently produced social content during the off-season, it has a few new things in store for the season two premiere. On Thursday, HBO launched its first Pinterest account, for Girls, curated by the show\\'s costume designer Jenn Rogein.  The show is also expanding its GetGlue presence, with custom badges for each episode, inspired by the \"All Adventurous Women Do\" cross-stitch in Hannah\\'s apartment. Each week a new digital cross-stitch of a quote from that episode will be released, and one fan will be chosen at random to win a real, framed cross-stitch from Etsy artist Katie Kutthroat.  Girls has given away some fan-appropriate giveaways to its loyal social media followers leading up to the premiere, including blowouts from Drybar, spin classes at SoulCycle, and a year\\'s rent and an apartment makeover from Urban Outfitters.  Has Girls\\' social marketing changed the way you relate to its characters? Let us know in the comments if your appreciate the immersive experience.

Here it\\'s shown compared to the Canon T4i (right). The SL1 will be available in April for $649.99 (body only).          Canon Rebel SL1, Angle View The SL1 includes continuous autofocus, and it\\'s compatible with Canon\\'s \"quiet\" lenses that use the feature.          Compared With T4i, No Lenses           Compared With T4i, Top           Front View           Back View           Front View, No Lens           Top View           Angle View, Flash Extended           What\\'s in the Box         Canon unveiled on Thursday what it says is the smallest and lightest DSLR camera ever made, the EOS Rebel SL1. Its footprint is significantly smaller than the company\\'s lightweight T4i DSLR, although it\\'s still not quite as small as the EOS-M mirrorless design. The SL1 weighs less than a pound — just 14.36 ounces. Overall dimensions (WxHxD) are 4.6 x 3.6 x 2.7 inches. While it\\'s close to the EOS-M in size (but significantly thicker to accommodate the mirror), it shares the same curved overall design as most Canon DSLRs. The camera has a new 18-megapixel sensor in the standard APS-C size, paired with the company\\'s DIGIC5 image processor. The sensor is a new Hybrid CMOS AF II design, which Canon says provides a wider area for the nine-point autofocus system when using Live View. SEE ALSO: Canon Gives DSLRs a True Challenger With Mirrorless EOS M  The camera does a few of the tricks of other recent Canon DSLRs, including continuous autofocus for video (first seen on the T4i) as well as the ability to use Canon\\'s special lenses that ensure said autofocusing is whisper-quiet. The 3-inch LCD in the rear is a touchscreen. One interesting omission, however: No Wi-Fi — a feature that debuted on Canon\\'s DSLR line last fall in the 6D. Other specs are pretty standard: an ISO range of 100-12,800, full HD (1080p) video shooting at 30 frames per second, and shutter speed that goes up to 1/4,000 of a second. Canon also threw in some creativity features, including an Effect Shot mode, which creates two images from the same photo: the normal one, and another with you selected Instagram-like filter. The Rebel SL1 is coming in April for the tidy sum of $649.99 (body only) or $799.99 (bundled with an EF-S 18-55mm lens). How do you like Canon\\'s lightweight Rebel?

       " ' Albuquerque, N.M. — not tech-obsessed San Francisco or New York — has claimed the title of first city to install an operational Bitcoin vending machine in the U.S.  The machine is up and running, as of Tuesday, at a cigar shop called Imbibe near the University of New Mexico, according to an announcement by Lamassu, the machine\\'s manufacturer. The vending machine allows people to insert cash — in exchange, it gives a digital stash of the increasingly popular cryptocurrency.  See also: A Complete, Interactive History of Bitcoin  First operational #bitcoin ATM in USA!! Imbibe Nob Hill in ABQ. Congrats @LamassuBTC @JuanLlanos @msantoriESQ pic.twitter.com/uXUGwfchoV — Pedro (@99Piloto) February 18, 2014  \"This is my current contribution to advancing Bitcoin into the mainstream,\" Eric Stromberg, owner of the Albuquerque Bitcoin vending machine, told Mashable. Though the machines have been hailed as Bitcoin \"ATMs,\" Lamassu eschewed the term in favor of \"vending machine\" since the device does not function like a true ATM in that it doesn\\'t dispense cash.  A true Bitcoin ATM might not be far behind, though. Robocoin, a Las Vegas-based company that installed its first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver last year, has said it intends to install the first U.S. Bitcoin ATMs later this month. The Robocoin machines allow for both cash-to-Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-cash transactions.  Prospective Bitcoin vending machine operators have been trying to bring the devices to other cities, such as New York and San Francisco, for some time, but they\\'ve faced regulatory hurdles.  \"I can\\'t really afford to hire a team of lawyers to walk me through the legal issues involved with this machine,\" Cole Albon told Mashable. \"I do not wish to pick a fight with any government official, but I feel that rather than throw people in jail for money laundering, the government should offer up some resources into making [anti-money laundering] compliance easier for the little guy.\" Albon, a San Francisco resident, has been in possession of a Lamassu vending machine for about a month, but he has not been able to deploy it thus far. He said California requires a $250,000 bond to operate the machine, in addition to a prohibitively strict anti-money laundering program. Albon suggested more relaxed regulation in New Mexico allowed it to become host the country\\'s first Bitcoin vending machine. Stromberg, who initially hoped to place his machine in San Francisco, also said that the regulatory climate in New Mexico made it a better choice than California. Enchanted Bitcoins, Stromberg\\'s company, said it believes it has cleared these hurdles by establishing a full anti-money laundering program and registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury\\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Those safeguards require Enchanted Bitcoins to monitor its customer base for suspicious activity. Any violation or negligence could result in serious problems. The Bitcoin community learned that lesson the hard way last month, when one of its favorite sons was arrested for such violations. Federal officials charged Charlie Shrem, co-founder and CEO of exchange platform BitInstant, with conspiring to commit money laundering and failing to report suspicious activity. Prosecutors say Shrem knowingly conducted and even facilitated business with a shadowy figure who was funneling bitcoins to users of Silk Road, the online black market for drugs.  \"I take my responsibility very seriously to manage this risk aggressively,\" Stromberg said. Aside from Bitcoin\\'s reputation for use in illicit transactions, users of the shiny new Albuquerque machine should also beware because the price of Bitcoin has been extremely volatile during the past four months. It climbed to all-time highs in January before nosediving due to a system-wide glitches last week.

       " '     Apple fans were underwhelmed by the latest product updates revealed on Monday, with most of them more curious about when the next iPhone will launch.  Consumers who gathered outside the flagship Apple Store in New York City on Tuesday said they were unimpressed with the company\\'s announcements from the day before at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, although the reaction from Apple customers in San Francisco was more enthusiastic. SEE ALSO: Top 25 Free iPhone Apps of All Time  \"Everything was relatively incremental,\" said 26-year-old Tim Schultz, who was traveling to New York from Orlando, Fla. \"iOS 7 has some interesting new graphics and I\\'m sure it will be an improvement, but it\\'s more of the same. There hasn\\'t been any groundbreaking innovation from Apple in the past year or so, especially in terms of hardware.\" Besides iOS 7 for the iPhone and iPad, which will become available in the fall, many people said they hadn\\'t even heard about the string of new products, which includes updated MacBook Air laptops, a music streaming service called iTunes Radio and OS X Mavericks for the Mac. And when we mentioned there was products news, it was generally met with the same follow-up question: \"When will there be a new iPhone?\" Existing iPhone users showed some interest in the Find My iPhone feature, which will come to iOS 7, and works even when the device is turned off.  \"I lost my iPhone recently, which is why I was just in the store,\" said Chantal Gagnon, visiting the 59th Street Apple Store from Connecticut. \"The feature would have been very helpful for me a few days ago — my iPhone has been off, so I haven\\'t been able to locate it. That will be great to have moving forward.\" Customers at the Apple Store in downtown in San Francisco were a bit more excited about the WWDC announcements, although that was in part because many Apple developers were in town to attend the conference. “I\\'m pleased to see some radical changes, although I’m not really entirely sure how it’s going to go over with a mainstream audience,\" said Seth Clifford, CIO of an interactive web and mobile design company, who attended the Apple keynote. \"Obviously it’s a pretty polarizing release.\" As for the name of the new OS X Mavericks software — which is a stray from Apple\\'s signature cat-themed names — Clifford is among those on board: \"It\\'s a good direction to go in. You can only take big cats so far,\" he said. \"I like the overall aesthetic of it, and Mountain Lion was great — vastly improved over Lion — so I’m excited to see it.” Meanwhile, Waiel Almoustadi from Canada watched the entire announcement online, which was streamed from the event\\'s web page. \"The most impressive part for me was the reveal of the iOS 7,\" Almoustadi said. \"I really liked it — loved it. There was a lot of speculation around it, but I would like to see a hands-on of the devices.\" For a full look at how consumers reacted in San Francisco, check out the video above.

       " ' The mysterious pro-Assad hacker group known as the Syrian Electronic Army was back in the spotlight this week, when it hijacked The New York Times and Twitter Internet domains. Following the attack, which was just the latest in a long string of successful hacks at the expense of Western media outlets, the purported official Twitter account of the hacking group tweeted a Gmail email address in response to a media request for contact. See also: War in Syria: Interactive Map Outlines Major Battle Zones  @onthemedia You cant contact http://t.co/lfDt55BHIm@gmail.com. — SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA16) August 28, 2013  I contacted the group — or at least the people claiming to be part of the group — to ask a few questions and exchanged a series of emails with them.  The people behind the Gmail account — who declined to give any personal information about themselves — responded quickly, saying they\\'d get back to me as soon as possible. They seemed pretty courteous as well, addressing me with a \"Dear Lorenzo,\" thanking me for contacting them, and even sending me another email a few hours later just to inform me that they were still \"working on it.\"  First, I asked them to somehow verify that they were the same people behind the  @Official_SEA16, the group\\'s Twitter account they had recently used to announce their hacks against The New York Times and Twitter. In response, the group followed me on Twitter and responded to one of my direct messages. This only proves the same people that control the Twitter account also control syrian.es.sy@gmail.com. Below, I pasted my full email correspondence with the group. My questions are printed in bold text. The answers from the alleged Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) representatives are completely unedited. Q&A With Syrian Electronic Army How many people are in your group? We have tens of thousands of members that have different roles according to their abilities with more people joining everyday or volunteering. We have a special operations division that you are probably asking about and we have more than ten specialists. Every member of the SEA counts no matter what their abilities are, everyone contributes to fight the media war against our country, that is why we are an army and not just a hacking group.  Are you all based in Syria? Yes, we are all based in Syria. This answer slightly differs to the one given by an alleged SEA hacker nicknamed \"The Shadow,\" who told ABC News that \"most\" of the SEA members are located in Syria.  Do you have any contacts or support from Chinese hackers? I asked this because I was curious to know if they had contacts with the more skilled Chinese hackers, who the U.S. government often mentions as one of the biggest threats to American national security.  None of us speak Chinese so I don\\'t see how we would communicate with them. Also, the Chinese hackers tend to attack American targets to steal information and then sell it to companies that undermine US manufacturers. We have been attacking the media, do you know any Chinese group that does that, even at the height of frictions during the Chinese olympics [sic]? Clearly, all these allegations that other nations are helping us is an attempt to undermine people\\'s impression of the Syrian people\\'s capabilities, it is an indirect form of racism.  Were you members of any other hacking group before forming the SEA? None of us were, the war on Syria brought us all together. On Wednesday, Motherboard, and security reporter Brian Krebs published two separate stories claiming to identify two members of the SEA.  Motherboard named Hatem Deeb, identifying him as \"Th3 Pr0,\" while Krebs exposed Mohammed Osman, and initially mistakenly claimed he was the same person as Mohamad AlKarem. Mashable\\'s Fran Berkman argued that Osman and AlKarem are most likely different people.   Two stories from yesterday claim to have identified some of your members, can you comment on these two stories? Is Mohammed Osman one of your leaders? What about Hatem Deeb? The story has been the source of amusement and laughter for all of us. Neither Hatem Deeb nor Mohammed Osman are hackers, but are both friends of ours that they are trying to intimidate in order to blackmail us. What they\\'re doing is actually illegal and irresponsible, they even posted a photograph of a random guy that none of us could identify and called him the leader of the SEA. Knowing what Obama\\'s Al Qaeda terrorists are capable of, do these news sites really want blood no their hand? Because if so, we will make them pay the price for it. Note that they say Deeb and Osman are \"friends of ours.\"  What about Mohamad Abd AlKarem? Some claimed he was the same person as Osman, but, as we reported Thursday, he most likely isn\\'t. We said that the information is false, We don\\'t know anything about Osman nor Abd Alkarem, The media is not about publishing innocent people name and say that they are members of SEA, the terrorists can track and kill them, we were shocked when we see innocent people names and pictures on Vice/KerbsonSecurity claiming that they are a part of SEA, then they updated their articles with denies, and for what? for some attention? You say Osman and Deeb are \"friends\" what does that mean? What do they do for you? Has Osman done some graphics for you?  That mean they are not even members of SEA, We have many fans and anyone of them can make some graphics, we didn\\'t request anything from anyone. Do you take orders from the government or you\\'re just in support of Assad? We don\\'t take orders from anyone and in fact, given that the Syrian Computer Society (SCS) succumbed to American pressure and closed down our website, it should be clear that we have no government support as no one from the state told them to retain it. Assad is the leader of the country and when your country goes into war, you must support its leader and its army for the nation to survive. The group is referring to an incident at the end of May, when the state-controlled Syrian Computer Society stopped hosting the group\\'s official website, as the SEA explains in this announcement. Your main site got hacked in the past, what happened, how much sensitive data did you lose in the hack? In this question I refer to something that Krebs mentioned in his story on Tuesday, when he wrote that the website of the SEA was hacked, according to one of his confidential sources. During the hack, \"the attacker(s) gained access to the virtual servers that hosted the SEA’s site and downloaded the entire user database for sea.sy and syrianelectronicarmy.com,\" collecting usernames and passwords. Some of these passwords are allegedly the same passwords that some of the hackers use for their Hotmail, MSN and Outlook accounts, according to Krebs, who also posted a screenshot of a portion of the database that the attacker got his or her hands on.  We can guarantee our website has never been hacked, those who claim to have hacked it should publish their evidence. Don\\'t hold your breath. In any case we do not have any sensitive or personal data on a public server. We are a distributed group, most of what we have and need is on our own machines and we collaborate on IRC. How would you respond to people who say that your techniques are amateur?  We challenge any of the haters to go out and hack even one of the websites we have penetrated. They will claim they don\\'t attack the media, but then the same hypocrites go out and DDoS Syrian news sites like SANA. Isn\\'t it ironic that they were not able to penetrate Syrian media sites all this time? Furthermore, you can ask the Harvard administrators how \"amateur\" the hacking of its website was [referring to their hack of the university\\'s website], they will let you know. We don\\'t have to use our most powerful techniques when majority of the targets have their front door open. War is all about retaining your trump cards for the final battle.  Why do you always announce your hacks? Wouldn\\'t you be more effective if your operations were covert and secret?  Who ever said we announce ALL of our attacks? ;) In fact, our most effective attacks have been completely covert and only when the war ends will we reveal our involvement. We are supporting Syria in every way we can and our successful operations will be made known when we all celebrate our sweet sweet victory. That said, a lot of questionable media have attempted to pin attacks by others, or fake attacks, on the SEA in order to undermine us. One very low quality media outlet claimed [perhaps here they are referring to this] we attacked an Israeli SCADA system [a type of industrial control system]. Despite our denial, the claim persisted until the Israelis themselves denied the attack. So to make sure things are clear, if we deny involvement in an attack, this is the truth and it definitely does not mean it is a covert operation.  What\\'s your plan in case of a U.S. attack on Syria? What are your capabilities? Are you going to start attacking U.S. government targets or keep focusing on the media? The moment the US government breaks international law by attacking the sovereign state of Syria, it has given up any rights to complain about being targeted by us or any other group around the world, as it would have lost all legitimacy. Yes, we will target all of it. Have you tried to hack Mashable? If so, why? And what would you do if you successfully hack us? We haven\\'t made any attempts against Mashable because one member of the group is a big fan and asked us not to. But you guys better stay off our naughty list!!! What are your thoughts on Anonymous? Who do you think are the best hacking groups in the world? Anonymous is not really a group but an idea, some of them have shown great skill and endurance in the case of the offshoot LulzSec. Unfortunately for them, they chose to flaunt their power and were eventually penetrated by the FBI and used to attack foreign governments including Syria. Otherwise, it has mainly been their usual vector: DDoS. It\\'s not fair to say who the best hacking group, but groups like TeaMp0isoN and RedHack have been effective. You said you have no ties to Chinese hackers, what about Iranian hackers? The group initially ignored this question, but they did answer later when I asked again.  Why is your website down?  We are using syrianelectronicarmy.com as DNS server, but Name.com company suspended it, and that\\'s why the website down. The group linked to this tweet, in which they embedded a screenshot of an email allegedly coming from Scott McBreen, from domain provider Name.com.  Sorry, Our website will not be available for the next few hours, http://t.co/QIpcpKdgYp suspended our account #SEA pic.twitter.com/i1N8K8Q8vP — SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA16) August 28, 2013  This is how the SEA\\'s website looked on April 23. Why are you giving us (and other Western media) answers if these are the same organizations that you attack and blame for misinformation about Syria? Through our answers we can also deliver our message about what is happening in Syria to all that media followers. Is there another way to talk to you? Skype, encrypted chat or phone? We\\'re sorry but we can\\'t talk to anyone on Skype now or ever. Why do you use Gmail? Aren\\'t you worried about NSA surveillance? Do you use different email using your own servers and PGP for more sensitive communications?  There are not sensitive information in this email, we contact each others through secure channels. Thanks, what kind of security do you use? PGP? OTR? Silent Circle maybe? What kind of encryption. Also, I think you forgot to answer about Iranian hackers (You said you have no ties to Chinese hackers, what about Iranian hackers?) We use IRC channels, and we don\\'t have any connection with Iranian/Russian/Chinese hackers. Some questions provided by Fran Berkman. Mashable composite.

       " ' Jill Erber graduated with a computer science degree from the University of Chicago in 1998, but instead of coding she wound up getting into cheesmongering.  Erber\\'s restaurant/cheese boutique Cheesetique was a hit right from the start in 2004. By 2008, it had outgrown its original \"shoebox-sized\" location in the Del Rey neighborhood of Alexandria, Va., and by 2011 had opened up a second location in nearby Arlington. Yet it\\'s the rare entrepreneur who can completely shun the tech world these days. Even if your business has nothing to do with tech — like Erber\\'s — you still have to worry about how it comes off on the Internet. That\\'s why in early 2013, Erber was wondering if Cheesetique could do a better job.  Many small business owners would be happy with the amount of Facebook fans that Cheesetique has — almost 3,000 between two Facebook CheesetiqueShirlingtonPages — but Erber wants more. \"I would like to increase our exposure to existing and potential customers. I\\'d like to grow our reputation as the \\'experts\\' in the world of cheese,\" she says, adding that she would also \"love to increase store volume. And of course, there\\'s world peace.\" Alas, the latter may have to wait, but David Wittlinger might be able to help with some of the other stuff. Wittlinger is the  web designer and social media strategist behind Colomark Media in Steamboat Springs, Colo. As with our previous social media makeover stories, Mashable has paired a small business in need of some social media marketing help (Cheesetique) with a social media guru (Wittlinger) from our Small Business Panel to see how such advice plays out in the real world. Lucky for Erber, Wittlinger hardly phoned in his assignment. After a phone conversation, he had created nine pages of consulting notes replete with suggestions for posts during every day of June.  Wittlinger\\'s first bit of advice for Erber was to assess the clientele of her two restaurants. As he notes, the two are \"distinctly different.\" The Del Rey one hosts a lot of dual-income couples with families who order full meals, while the Arlington one features more singletons and government employees with a penchant for wine and cheeseboards over full dinners. For that reason, Wittlinger went against his initial gut reaction and advocated keeping the two Facebook Pages separate instead of lumping them both into one.  He also recommends doing more with Cheesetique\\'s blog, The Cheeselog. While Erber has been using the blog often as a promotional platform (for special deals, etc.), Wittlinger thinks she should use it to show off her prodigious knowledge of cheese and position herself as an expert. In fact, Wittlinger recommends making the blog the hub of Cheesetique\\'s outbound communication and using the Facebook Pages for location-specific updates. Among Wittlinger\\'s other recommendations:  Improve your email marketing. Cheesetique has more than 14,000 subscribers. Wittlinger stresses that the communication with those subscribers should be \"solid\" and should employ \"one-way, we\\'re talking to you\" tactics.  Use social media as a listening platform. \"Much of the process will incorporate tracking and adapting your efforts in finding what works,\" he says. Use staffers to add more personality. Wittlinger suggests culling suggestions and ideas from staff but funneling them all through one point person (Jill), at least for now.   Putting all this together and making sure to post daily will mean about five hours a week of work, Wittlinger estimates. Erber is also willing to buy some Facebook advertising during the month to raise Cheesetique\\'s profile. She hasn\\'t decided on an exact figure, but Wittlinger suggests $300, or $10 a day.  Will it work? Check back here later in the month to see. Meanwhile, read about some other Social Media Makeover projects here.

       " ' If it felt like your Twitter feed earlier Wednesday was nothing but tweets about the new pope, well ... that\\'s because it probably was. Twitter said it had seen some 7 million tweets related to the new pontiff, a number that seems sure to grow by the end of the day. At its peak, the papal tweeting reached a crescendo of 132,000 tweets per minute. That\\'s not quite a groundbreaking number, however. President Obama\\'s 2012 election victory set the record at 237,000 tweets per minute back in November. Some 20 million tweets were sent on election night. If a new pope can\\'t beat that number, we doubt anything will for some time. But the election of Pope Francis does clock in as the second biggest Twitter event of all time in the tweets per minute range — ahead of the Spice Girls reunion concert (116,000 tweets per minute) and Usain Bolt\\'s 100 meter gold medal (88,000 tweets per minute), both achieved during the London Olympics last August. Social media analysis firm Topsy came up with a slightly higher number of 137,000 tweets per minute, and said it saw 4 million tweets in the two hours immediately following that first puff of white smoke from the papal conclave. All in all, those tweets were seen an impressive 15 billion times. The pope also captured eight out of Twitter\\'s top 10 worldwide trending topics in the hour after his election. And where were the tweets coming from? It won\\'t surprise you to learn that a good chunk (19%) came from Jorge Mario Bergoglio\\'s home country of Argentina. But the U.S. is slightly ahead at 21%. In general, it seems a very healthy majority came from the Americas:  Then of course there was the famous \"first\" tweet from the @Pontifex account — which had deleted all its content from the Pope Benedict era.

       " ' Is YouTube America\\'s new sex-ed teacher? It\\'s starting to look that way.  New research from author and clinical psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair has found many teens are turning to Internet videos to educate themselves on topics relating to sexual health, including sexuality, dating, and gender stereotypes.  Societal norms around sex and dating — especially among teens — have changed dramatically in the last few years, says Steiner-Adair, and most of the change can be chalked up to a \"sex-saturated culture\" and the technology used to propagate it.  See also: Keep It Clean: 8 Tools to Block Porn and Sexting Teens may not even realize they are learning when they log in to social media sites or watch viral videos on YouTube. Often they are simply observing a sexually-charged culture that society has numbed to, says Steiner-Adair.  Steiner-Adair\\'s research is highlighted in her new book, The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age, which hit shelves Tuesday. The project started four years ago when she became concerned with how people were relating to one another through technology and social media.  She has since interviewed over 1,000 children between the ages of 4 and 18, plus 1,000 parents and teachers.  Without parents monitoring what their children view online, Internet access provides teens and children with content that can be confusing, including porn or other graphic images that can create a false understanding of appropriate sexual behavior.  This confusion encourages teens in particular to behave a particular way online that they never would in face-to-face interactions, says Stenier-Adair. \"[There is] a disconnect between who kids are in their heart of hearts and who they are online,\" she explains. \"It\\'s as if kids have two different selves.\"  Today\\'s youth hasn\\'t simply grown up with technology at its fingertips, it turns out. They have used technology to expedite the growth process. A 2010 Pew Internet study [PDF] found that 17% of teens went to the Internet to gather sexual health information that was \"hard to discuss with others.\"  The result of this unintended online education and increase in social media use has been inappropriate sexual behavior among children, even as young as elementary school. \"Flirting\" has transformed from a harmless note in class (\"Do you like me: yes or no?\") to more aggressive texts or social media messages, in some cases even explicit photos, says Steiner-Adair.  A February report from the Urban Institute [PDF] found that 25% of dating teens have been abused or harassed online or in text messages by their partner — not including cases where harassment came from someone not involved in the relationship. In one focus group during her research, Steiner-Adair met a 13-year-old who asked why women like being choked while having sex. The boy was basing his question on a YouTube video he\\'d seen. In other instances, children as young as 8 years old have imitated pornography at school, again prompted by online videos. \"There\\'s been really radical change in the last couple years with how boys and girls are flirting and courting,\" says Steiner-Adair. \"We have lost the barriers to protect childhood.\" One of the more surprising elements of Steiner-Adair\\'s research is that boys often fail to realize they are acting inappropriately when they are degrading to girls or use abusive language — they think they\\'re flirting.  Too often, \"you grow up and join the dominant culture,\" she says — a culture that YouTube mirrors, warts and all.  See also: Ad Illustrates How Sexting Can Ruin a Teen\\'s Life The negative impact this type of behavior has on girls is often studied. But Steiner-Adair says that boys are hurt by it, too, feeling trapped and pressured to behave in ways that rid them of their natural sweetness.\"[Simply] saying \\'boys will be boys\\' is abandoning the rich, inner lives of young men,\" she says.

       " ' The term \"fair use\" gets thrown around a lot in copyright cases, and it refers to an exception to copyright law that allows for the publication of portions or derivations of a copyrighted work — without the permission of the original creator. On the web, fair use has been used to defend aggregators such as Google News, since they take portions of articles to create a service. Does that label also apply to a service that does a similar thing, but for a newsletter? A U.S. court recently said it doesn\\'t. As paidContent describes, a federal court ruled that Meltwater, a Norwegian company that does \"news and social media monitoring\" was violating copyright with its newsletter service. Meltwater\\'s service scans articles for keywords, then takes the headline, the first paragraph or \"lede,\" and the parts of the story where the keyword appears. The Associated Press sued Meltwater, saying it was violating the AP\\'s copyright on the articles, and that it needed to purchase a license to serve up its content in this way. Meltwater defended its actions under copyright\\'s fair-use doctrine, saying its newsletter service was doing basically the same thing that Google does every second of every day. SEE ALSO: Judge Hits Blogger With $2.5 Million Charge for Not Being a Journalist  Heavy hitters took sides. The Electronic Frontier Federation backed Meltwater, warning that if the AP was successful in its claim, it would have a chilling effect on innovation and free expression. Meanwhile, The New York Times and others sided with the AP, saying Meltwater was a \"free-rider\" operating a \"wholesale copying and redistribution\" service. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote riled in favor of the AP. While on first blush Meltwater\\'s service doesn\\'t appear to be all that different from Google News, it\\'s all in the details. The law around fair use inherently allows for flexibility, but whether or not a particular complaint amounts to a violation is dependent on four factors: the purpose of the duplicated content, the nature of the copyrighted work, how much of the original was copied, and the effect on the market. The first factor — the purpose of the use — is often the most important factor in a fair-use case, and it was so here. In her 90-page ruling, the judge rejected Meltwater\\'s claim that its service was like a search engine, which passes the fair-use test because creating a page with several links changes the context essentially \"transforms\" the copyrighted work into a different kind of service. That wasn\\'t the case with Meltwater, the judge said, for three reasons. First, the service acted more like a competitor to the AP than a facilitator, she wrote, pointing to the newsletter\\'s click-through rates on articles, which were less than one-tenth of 1%. By comparison, she said Google News users clicked through 56% of the time, citing a 2009 report from Outsell. Second, by reproducing an article\\'s lede and keyword sentences in their entirety, Meltwater was essentially taking the \"heart\" of the stories it was excerpting, rather than serving as a teaser, she wrote. Finally, she believed the newsletter was taking more of the articles than was needed for a \"search engine\" type of service. The ruling will certainly be appealed, but it could serve as a precedent in determining where the line is for services that depend on excerpting third-party content. What\\'s your take? Should Meltwater have to pay the AP to clip portions of its articles for a newsletter, or should fair use apply here? Vote in our poll, then tell us your reasoning in the comments.

       " ' Country singer Brad Paisley has turned to Twitter to address the controversy surrounding his new song with rapper LL Cool J called \"Accidental Racist,\" saying the entire album was intended to \"evoke feelings\" and \"wouldn\\'t change a thing\" about it. News about the song — which has since been pulled from YouTube but still remains on music streaming service Spotify — received a flood of online criticism on Monday when it was posted online.

The song begins as Paisley walks into a Starbucks with a confederate flag on his t-shirt. He explains he\\'s wearing it because he\\'s a Lynyrd Skynrd fan. Some of the lyrics are as follows: \"I\\'m proud of where I\\'m from, but not everything we\\'ve done,\" Paisley sings. \"It ain\\'t like you and me can rewrite history.

McDonald\\'s Promoted Trend Goes Wrong  Back in January, McDonald\\'s tried to promote its brand and engage with customers through two promoted trends: #meetthefarmers and #mcdstories. Unfortunately for McDonald\\'s, many Twitter users decided to post their horror stories at the fast food chain using the second of those hashtags. In essence, McDonald\\'s paid to promote a trend that showered the company in bad publicity. McDonald\\'s later admitted that \"#mcdstories did not go as planned.\"  Image: Flickr, Brilith         2. Snickers Investigated for Paying Celebs to Tweet   Early this year, Snickers paid several celebs in the UK to tweet pictures of themselves eating Snickers bars.  The ad campaign didn\\'t sit well with the UK\\'s Office of Fair Trading, which requires companies to explicitly spell out when a product is being endorsed. The OFT launched an investigation into the Twitter ads, but eventually cleared Snickers of wrongdoing.  Image courtesy of @rioferdy5           3. NRA Posts Pro-Gun Tweet After Aurora Shooting   Talk about bad timing. American Rifleman, a journal affiliated with the National Rifle Association, posted a pro-gun tweet as the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. was unfolding.  The tweet itself appeared to have been pre-scheduled through Hootsuite, but needless to say, it struck a nerve. The tweet was deleted several hours later and the account was deleted later that day, as well.            4. CelebBoutique Ignites Firestorm With Aurora Tweet  The NRA wasn\\'t the only organization to ignite a firestorm on Twitter following the Aurora shooting. CelebBoutique, an online store, posted a promotional tweet with the Aurora hashtag to take advantage of a trending topic. Unfortunately, the company\\'s PR apparently did not take the time to read up on why Aurora was trending, so the tweet came off as incredibly insensitive.           5. Chick-Fil-A\\'s Back-to-Back Controversies   Chick-Fil-A endured two back-to-back social media controversies in the middle of 2012. The first and arguably more serious of the two emerged after the company\\'s founder spoke out firmly against same-sex marriage. Critics blasted Chick-Fil-A on various social networks, and the company\\'s Facebook page was briefly taken over by posts that had nothing to do with chicken.   Shortly afterwards, Chick-Fil-A was accused of creating a fake Facebook account to come to the company\\'s defense. This time, it pertained to a related controversy: whether a particular Chick-Fil-A location had recalled Jim Hensen\\'s Creature Shop Puppet toys after Hensen\\'s organization came out against Chick-Fil-A\\'s stance on gay marriage. Chick-Fil-A later denied that it created the account.    Image: iStockphoto,  rhythmbehavior         6. Microsoft Disses Ann Coulter  Microsoft briefly got political in September, when one of the people who manages its Twitter account dissed conservative talking head Ann Coulter from the Microsoft account, rather than from his personal account. Microsoft replied to a tweet from former U.S. labor secretary Robert Reich with the following post: \"@RBReich your granddaughter’s level of discourse and policy > those of Ann Coulter.\" Ouch.  Image: Flickr, Gage Skidmore         7. KitchenAid Anti-Obama Tweet   When it comes to offensive tweets, KitchenAid takes the cake. After President Obama mentioned his grandmother during the first presidential debate in October, the kitchen appliance manufacturer responded by posting the following tweet to its 24,000 followers: \"Obamas gma even knew it was going 2 b bad! She died 3 days b4 he became president. #nbcpolitics\" To the company\\'s credit, it quickly removed the tweet and issued an apology, explaining that a member of the KitchenAid team had mistakenly posted it from the company account instead of from a personal handle.            8. StubHub Drops the F-Bomb  Shortly after the KitchenAid incident, StubHub had its own social media snafu. Someone posted a vulgar tweet from StubHub\\'s account, calling the ticket sales website a \"stubsucking hell hole.\" The tweet was up for about an hour before the company finally deleted it and issued an apology. It\\'s unclear whether the tweet came from an unhappy StubHub employee or if the account was hacked.           9. American Apparel Teases Hurricane Sandy Promotion  Word to the wise: Think twice before you try to turn a natural disaster into a promotional opportunity. American Apparel offered 20% off for those in states affected by Hurricane Sandy, in case they were \"bored\" by the storm. Customers quickly took to Twitter and other social networks to criticize the ad.          10. Gap Angers Storm Victims With Hurricane Sandy Tweet  American Apparel wasn\\'t the only retailer to frustrate those affected by Hurricane Sandy. As the storm made its way up the East Coast, The Gap seemed to encourage those hunkering down for the storm to do some online shopping. The company eventually took down the tweet and offered a semi-apology.          11. Macy\\'s Blasted for Relationship With Donald Trump   Earlier this month, Macy\\'s was pressured to drop spokesman Donald Trump after Trump\\'s publicity stunt, in which he offered to donate $5 million in exchange for President Obama\\'s college records and passport application.   More than half a million people signed an online petition asking Macy\\'s to sever its relationship with Trump, and the retailer\\'s Facebook and Twitter pages were bombarded with anti-Trump comments.

       " '  Low battery, you may have met your match. A new portable charging system aims to put on-the-go power in your pocket, boasting a set-up that reportedly doesn\\'t compromise on power or portability. Modulo, developed by Barcelona-based tech company Idapt, is a credit card-sized gadget that claims to power any USB device, wherever you go. See also: 8 Solar-Powered Mobile Chargers \"All our lifestyle now goes to electronics — it\\'s portable, really portable,\" Idapt CEO Jacques Giribet told Mashable. \"We have designed a battery that is as small as possible, taking into account that we want it to give you the same power as the original battery.\" Once an electronic device is connected to a Modulo, either with its original charger or one of Idapt\\'s mini cables, the battery begins to power up. The two can be even more securely attached with special adhesive strips that don\\'t leave any residue behind. Stacking multiple Modulos on top of one another means more juice for a faster charge. For example, one Modulo would be enough to power up a smartphone as quickly as a normal charger would, but a tablet would need two or three to reach a full charge in the fastest possible time, the company claims.  Image:  Idapt The Modulos themselves can be charged from any wall socket, while connected to a computer or with a wireless receiver. Idapt also hopes it will be able to offer a solar-charging panel and crank add-on that creates its own energy. A Modulo can last up to about six months on one charge, according to the company.  There are plenty of other on-the-go charging options out there. According to Giribet, what sets Modulo apart from the rest of the pack is the fact that it\\'s compatible with so many devices, and users don\\'t have to choose between true portability — each Modulo weighs 2.4 ounces — and function. \"None of the solutions that are there are really a solution,\" Giribet said. Modulo\\'s Kickstarter campaign has already surpassed its fundraising goal, attracting more than $60,000 out of its original $30,000 goal, with 24 days remaining. It also won iLounge\\'s Best in Show award at CES 2014. Production is expected to begin June, and shipping will start in July. ',\n",
       " ' Windows Blue is real, and it\\'s coming before the end of the year. Windows marketing chief Tami Reller confirmed to Mashable that the next major update to Windows 8 is codenamed \"Blue\" and that it would ship by the 2013 holiday season. \"Blue\" is actually an internal Microsoft codename for the update, and the final product will have a different name, although Reller didn\\'t say what it would be. With Blue, Reller said, Microsoft has three main pillars:  Evolving Windows 8 for touch Addressing customer feedback Supporting new form factors, specifically 7- and 8-inch screen sizes  That last point is probably the most significant, since up till now manufacturers faced big technical hurdles in creating small-screen Windows 8 devices. It also means Windows tablets — such as the rumored Acer Iconia W3 — will soon be able compete directly with products such as the Kindle Fire HD and iPad mini. SEE ALSO: The Problem With Windows 8  \"What we did in Windows 8 was really to lay the foundation for taking advantage of mobile computing broadly, whether it was tablets or increasingly mobile PCs,\" Reller told Mashable in an interview at Microsoft\\'s New York offices. \"All of Blue is about continuing that vision.\" Besides smaller screen sizes, Windows Blue will support Intel\\'s upcoming Core (Haswell) and Atom (Bay Trail) processors as well as new ARM-based chips from Qualcomm (Snapdragon 800) and Nvidia (Tegra 4). Reller didn\\'t elaborate on which specific features of Blue were in response to customer feedback, including the reported \"boot to desktop\" mode and possible return of the start button, but she did say Microsoft would be offering details in the coming weeks before the company\\'s BUILD developer conference. Windows Blue would be an update, not an upgrade, Reller said, although she didn\\'t confirm if that meant it would be free for existing Windows 8 users.

Windows 8 is a dramatic departure from Windows 7, blowing up the Start menu into a vibrant Start Screen that\\'s electric with activity and well suited for touch devices like tablets. Despite some inconsistencies (particularly with the traditional desktop, which still exists), the new interface is powerful, fast and convenient.          Charms Wherever you are in the system, you can always call up the \"Charms\" from the right side -- a set of top-level commands that include Start, Search, Share, Devices and Settings.          Sharing Microsoft re-defined how apps communicate with each other, letting you share from any app that enables it. This is how sharing from the Netflix app looks, but the same functionality exists in most other apps with shareable content, calling up a similar list of sharing services.          Snap View Snap is kind of the new minimize, letting you put two apps side by side with one of them shrunk to a vertical column. It\\'s useful when the app is well suited to a scrolling list, like Bing.          Desktop Oddities Although the desktop still exists in Windows 8, the new UI is ever-present. It makes for some odd mash-ups, like this modern-looking Wi-Fi settings menu. Other functions call up traditional dialogs.          Windows Store The Windows Store has the same clean look and feel as other modern-UI apps, although it could use more big-name apps.          New York Times App The New York Times app mirrors the look of Microsoft\\'s news apps, with a horizontal scroll of stories you can naturally swipe through. The swiping works much better with a touchscreen, since on a touchpad swipe tends to take you too far ahead or back.          Rowi Twitter Client Here\\'s how a Twitter client looks in Windows 8. Twitter has said it\\'s working on its own Windows 8 app.          Syncing Via the Cloud One powerful feature of Windows 8 is your identity is portable -- if you have a Microsoft ID, you can log in to another Windows 8 PC, and it\\'ll import your settings via the cloud, effectively becoming your PC. You can even download your own apps to the new machine once you authorize it.       Image by Nina Frazier, Mashable ',\n",
       " \" Wearers of traditional eyeglasses got an early holiday treat this week when a Google employee leaked photos of what appear to be the prescription version of Google Glass.  Reportedly posted on the Google+ page of Brian Matiash, community manager for Google+ Photos, on Thursday, the images showing the modified version of Glass were quickly removed without explanation. Phandroid managed to capture the photos before they were taken down.  The new version of the wearable computing device (not pictured above) looks a lot like the current version, except it does away with the steel band completely, allowing the wearer to place their traditional eyeglasses in what appears to be a cradle within the body of Google Glass. It's unclear whether or not the cradle shown in the photos could house any pair of traditional eyeglasses; however, such a design seems unlikely given that eyeglass arms vary in width, and may not fit into the cradle. Based on what we can tell from the leaked photos, the other option would likely be a prescription version of Glass that includes a permanently attached eyeglass component; this would require a specific fit-to-face adjustment for each pair. Google has not released any official details regarding a prescription version of Google Glass. When contacted by Mashable, Google's Matiash declined to comment on the photos. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that VSP Global, a maker of frames and lenses, was in talks with Google to possibly offer alternative frame options to potential Glass users.  The most recent update on Glass came two weeks ago via a new round of invitations that Google sent to developers who want to purchase the $1,500 device.  Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \",\n",

       " ' NASA\\'s Kepler space telescope has discovered three exoplanets that may be capable of supporting life, and one of them is perhaps the most Earth-like alien world spotted to date, scientists announced Thursday. That most intriguing one is called Kepler-62f, a rocky world just 1.4 times bigger than Earth that circles a star smaller and dimmer than the sun. Kepler-62f\\'s newfound neighbor, Kepler-62e, is just 1.6 times larger than Earth, making the pair among the smallest exoplanets yet found in their star\\'s habitable zone — the just-right range of distances where liquid water can exist on a world\\'s surface. Kepler-62e and f, which are part of a newly discovered five-planet system, \"look very good as possibilities for looking for life,\" said Kepler science principal investigator Bill Borucki, of NASA\\'s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.  SEE ALSO: 9 Exoplanets That Could Host Alien Life  The third potentially habitable planet, called Kepler-69c, is 1.7 times bigger than Earth and orbits a star similar to our own. It\\'s the smallest world ever found in the habitable zone of a sunlike star, researchers said, and represents a big step toward discovering the first-ever \"alien Earth.\" \"We\\'re moving very rapidly toward finding an Earth analogue around a star like the sun,\" Borucki told SPACE.com. Researchers announced these newfound planets — all three of which are \"super-Earths,\" or worlds slightly larger than our own — today at a NASA news conference. The Kepler-62 discovery paper, led by Borucki, was also published today in the journal Science. The three potentially habitable worlds are part of a larger haul. All told, the scientists rolled out seven new exoplanets today — five in the Kepler-62 system and two in Kepler-69. Alien Water Worlds? The five newfound planets in the Kepler-62 system, which is located about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, range from 0.54 to 1.95 times the size of Earth. Only Kepler-62e and f are potentially habitable; the other three zip around the star at close range, making them too hot to support life as we know it, researchers said. Kepler-62e and f take 122 and 267 days, respectively, to complete one orbit around their star, which is just 20 percent as bright as the sun. While nobody knows what the two exoplanets look like, a separate modeling study suggests they\\'re both probably water worlds covered by endless, uninterrupted global oceans. SEE ALSO: Two Habitable Alien Water Worlds? (Video)  \"There may be life there, but could it be technology-based like ours? Life on these worlds would be under water with no easy access to metals, to electricity, or fire for metallurgy,\" lead author Lisa Kaltenegger, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said in a statement. \"Nonetheless, these worlds will still be beautiful blue planets circling an orange star — and maybe life’s inventiveness to get to a technology stage will surprise us,\" she added. Not surprisingly, Kepler-62e should be warmer than its more distantly orbiting neighbor. In fact, Kepler-62f may require a greenhouse effect to keep its ocean from freezing over, researchers said. “Kepler-62e probably has a very cloudy sky and is warm and humid all the way to the polar regions,\" co-author Dimitar Sasselov of Harvard said in a statement. \"Kepler-62f would be cooler, but still potentially life-friendly.\" The new modeling study has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Searching for Earth\\'s Twin The $600 million Kepler observatory launched in March 2009 to hunt for Earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Kepler finds alien worlds by detecting the tiny brightness dips caused when they transit, or cross the face of, their stars from the instrument\\'s perspective. Kepler has used this technique to great effect, spotting more than 2,700 potential planets since its March 2009 launch. While just 120 or so of these candidates have been confirmed to date, mission scientists estimate that more than 90 percent will end up being the real deal. While Kepler has yet to discover a true Earth twin, it\\'s getting closer and closer, Borucki said, pointing to the confirmation of Kepler-69c as an example. (That planet lies 2,700 light-years away, in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-69c\\'s neighbor Kepler-69b, which is about twice the size of Earth and too hot to host life, was also announced today.) \"I think we\\'re making excellent progress in that direction,\" Borucki said. \"We have a number of candidates that look good.\" Such steady progress makes sense, since Kepler will of course spot more transits the longer it looks. The telescope needs to observe three transits to flag a planet candidate, so detecting a potentially habitable world in a relatively distant orbit can take several years. Kepler cannot search for signs of life on worlds like Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f and Kepler-69c, but the telescope is paving the way for future missions that should do just that, Borucki said. \"This is one of the early steps, but there\\'s no mistake — we are on our way to explore the galaxy, to learn about life in the galaxy,\" he said.

Israel\\'s ground offensive and the deaths of Gazan children have also inflamed public opinion globally, sparking demonstrations worldwide.

For his part, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is heading to the Middle East to help end the conflict. In Santiago, Chile, 5,000 protestors surrounded the Israeli embassy on Saturday to protest the invasion, according to Al Arabiya.

       " '  Fist bumps aren\\'t just cool — they\\'re also hygienically preferable to handshakes.  A recent UK study said fist bumps spread far fewer germs than the traditional handshake, and even the high five. See also: Steve Wozniak Fist Bumps DMX Over \\'Planned Robbery\\' Researchers from Aberystwyth University\\'s Institute of Biological, Environmental, and Rural Sciences covered a greeter’s hand in a sterile glove, and then immersed it in germs. After that, the greeter shook hands, fist bumped or high-fived a recipient wearing a sterile glove. Researchers then measured the germ count on the recipient’s glove. Ultimately, the fist bump emerged  victorious, receiving the lowest germ count.  The traditional handshake was the worst offender, with nearly twice as many bacteria transferred, compared to the high five. However, \"significantly fewer\" bacteria were transferred during a fist bump than during a high five. The study comes just after The Journal of the American Medical Association published an article on banning handshakes in healthcare settings. No-contact greeting is \"unlikely\" to replace the handshake, researchers said, but a fist bump might do the trick. “Adoption of the fist bump as a greeting could substantially reduce the transmission of infectious diseases between individuals,” David Whitworth, the study\\'s author, said. The study will appear in the August issue of the American Journal of Infection Control. ',\n",
       " ' British authorities are investigating a string of racist tweets aimed at Yaya Touré just hours after the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder reactivated his Twitter account following a five-month hiatus from the platform. Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, based in England, was one of the first to report the abuse to the Greater Manchester Police Monday evening, and the department confirmed to The Guardian that it is looking into the incident.  See also: Are Twitter\\'s sports trolls out of control? The complaint was based on two separate tweets of \"racist nature\" in response to Touré\\'s first post after returning from a Twitter break to focus on the sport, which congratulated his team on a recent win over Manchester United, according to a statement released by Kick It Out.  Great to be back on twitter after a good win yesterday. Now my focus is on the next game... Happy Monday everyone!! — Yaya Touré (@YayaToure) November 3, 2014  “Yaya Touré has been back on Twitter for a matter of hours and he has already received abuse of an appalling nature,\" a Kick It Out spokesperson said in a press release. \"We are disturbed by the fact that someone can be treated this way. It makes footballers start to question why they should use these platforms.\"  Internet trolls can face much more severe penalties in Britain than in the United States, and the penalties may get even harsher. A proposed law currently making its way through Parliament would increase the maximum prison sentence for cyber-abuse from six months to two years.  Online abusers who have attacked British athletes, such as diving star Tom Daley and soccer player Carlton Cole, were later arrested for the harassment.  At least two of the abusive tweets apparently came from accounts with the handles, \"@IconicLamps\" and \"@CFCZone,\" which have both since been deleted. The tweets used racial slurs, called Touré \"ebola-infected\" and told him to \"go back to the cotton field,\" according to screenshots posted by other Twitter users. Touré addressed the trolls in a tweet posted on Tuesday, blaming the abuse on an \"ignorant minority.\" The 31-year-old also told BBC Sport that while he is used to hateful comments like these and has learned to deal with them, it could discourage other athletes from being active on social media.   Thanks for all the welcome back tweets and support. Shame about ignorant minority. #StillFocused — Yaya Touré (@YayaToure) November 4, 2014  The incident highlights a pervasive problem of racism in European soccer as a whole. Touré told the BBC that he would like to see FIFA do more to combat discrimination that players face across the league.  \"Football doesn\\'t have a colour. We\\'re just people from all over the world trying to enjoy the game,\" Touré told the BBC. \"I never see this in rugby, I never see that in tennis or anything else. I don\\'t know where it\\'s coming from.\" In April, FC Barcelona and Brazil star Dani Alves also stood up against racism within the game in a viral video in which he took a bite out of banana thrown by a fan as a racist taunt. The campaign was apparently planned ahead of time with teammate Neymar Jr.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

According to Whitehouse.gov guidelines, it is now entitled to an official response from the administration. The \"We the People\" petition, which aims to pardon Snowden of any crime he may have committed, was launched immediately after he revealed his identity as the source of the documents that exposed the U.S. government\\'s far-reaching surveillance programs.  SEE ALSO: Revealed: British Spy Agency Secretly Taps Global Communications  Hailing Snowden as a \"national hero,\" the petition says he \"should be immediately issued a full, free and absolute pardon for any crimes he has committed or may have committed related to blowing the whistle on secret NSA surveillance programs.\"  On Friday night, it was revealed that U.S. prosecutors had filed a criminal complaint, detailing the charges against Snowden. The whistleblower is accused of espionage, and theft and conversion of government property. Officials have also asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden, and will likely request extradition in the following weeks.  Although the petition has reached 100,000 signatures, it\\'s unclear whether an official will respond. Historically, the administration has been relatively slow to respond, especially to sensitive petitions.  It also has no self-imposed deadline to address petitions that have reached the threshold. What\\'s more, according to \"We the People\" guidelines, \"to avoid the appearance of improper influence, the White House may decline to address certain procurement, law enforcement, adjudicatory, or similar matters properly within the jurisdiction of federal departments or agencies, federal courts, or state and local government in its response to a petition.\" This exception, however vague, may apply in this case.

       " '  It\\'s no secret that Facebook isn\\'t the best place for keeping secrets.  Owen Campbell-Moore, a computer science student at Oxford University, designed a method to encrypt secret messages inside photos on the social networking site. It\\'s called Secretbook — essentially, it\\'s a Google Chrome extension that uses JPEG Steganography to encode data into photos by making virtually imperceptible changes to the image. The message is hidden in the digital makeup of the picture, not its pixels, so it\\'s comparable to digital invisible ink.   Campbell-Moore shared the news in a blog post Monday morning.  \"Steganography is essentially hiding messages in innocent cover, such as data and photos,\" he told Mashable. \"The idea was that these existing tools have never been able to be used on social networking websites. My professor, Andrew Ker, and I thought this was the best way. There are millions of photos being shared every day across the world on Facebook, so it seemed like the ideal medium.\" SEE ALSO: Make Your Password \\'Gooder\\' With Bad Grammar, Study Says  To use the app, you and your intended recipient can download the extension, then hit \"Control-Alt-A\" on Facebook to activate it. Upload a photo, and you\\'ll see a pop-up that tells you how many characters the image can hold. (Most character limits are around 136, similar to a tweet.) Once you enter your message, you\\'ll need to enter a password, which your recipient should know. When the photo is posted, whoever is receiving your message can hit \"Control-Alt-A\" on the photo, enter the password and, voilà, read your secret text.  Already, Campbell-Moore said, more than 7,000 people have downloaded the app from his website.

       " ' On anonymous social media app Secret, you can be anyone you want — even yourself. My new acquaintance, whom we\\'ll call Steve, has just organized one of the first Secret IRL meetups, which began with this simple Secret: \"Starting yet another expensive, consumption habit: artisanal whiskey. San Francisco, you can keep your $4 toast.\"  The Secret appeared in my feed because Steve is a \"friend of friend,\" meaning a contact saved in my phone book is also saved in his. It could easily be someone we exchanged numbers with for an OKCupid date or to purchase furniture via Craigslist. The social filtering is what makes Secret unique from other anonymous apps Yik Yak and Whisper — there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll see all posts from friends, because each user only sees a few new posts each day. See also: 8 After-Work Apps to Melt Your Stress Away The kicker that separates Secret from pseudonymous sites such as Reddit is that identity doesn\\'t follow you — you cannot build a reputation. On each Secret thread, you\\'re a new \"you.\" Thus, if you reveal yourself on Secret by sharing too much identifying information, it won\\'t out your other Secrets.  The more I\\'ve used Secret, the more often I\\'ve seen invitations to extend the conversation outside the app. That is not surprising, as many users share personal, intimate information (fears, medical difficulties, early pregnancies) that could benefit from real-life support.  Perhaps that\\'s why four Secret users, upon finding they, first, share an affinity for whiskey and, second, live in New York, decided to meet. Steve dropped a shortened Bitly link into the thread that led to a calendar tool, and four users added the days they were available. Then Steve updated the thread with our date and venue: Friday, 8 p.m. at Maysville, a whiskey bar in Manhattan.  Secret reveals location of popular posts, but only friends can comment on the thread.On my way to the blind whiskey date, I wondered what the interaction would be like — might the conversation skew personal and authentic, since the introduction had been made in that context? Although four Secret users confirmed in the thread that they would join, one cancelled, citing illness. Steve arrived with a friend, also a Secret user (we\\'ll call him Ben), whom he had coincidentally run into on his way to the bar, but who did not post on the thread. All of us work in tech-related fields, which seems to be the case for the majority of Secret users. In addition to talking about Secret itself, we also talked about failed relationships and work frustrations, which, once I mentioned I worked at Mashable, Steve said were \"off the record.\" This confirmed my suspicion that meeting on Secret might lead to us dropping, well, secrets — in real life, too. The third Secret user, whom we\\'ll call Green Bug, never arrived (users refer to each other by descriptions of the automatic avatars, such as Planet or Blue Crown).   While in-person meeting resulting from an anonymous social network is likely rare, I\\'m impressed with how quickly it happened — within two weeks of downloading the app. That\\'s faster than it took me to get an IRL meeting on some dating apps.  Because of users\\' desire to meet, Philip Kaplan, creator of anonymous message board F&cked Company in the dot-com crash, launched a site for easy private messaging. It\\'s called Anonyfish. After you choose a handle on Anonyfish, other Secret users can message you anonymously and privately. After we sampled three one-ounce pours of whiskey ranging from $1 to $9 each, Steve took a photo of our near-empty glasses and posted it back to Secret, with a note shaming Green Bug for standing us up. Despite being Steve\\'s friend-of-friend, the post never showed up in my stream. But perhaps, under new identities, we\\'ll all meet again. ',\n",

       " ' As winter sets in across the Middle East, a funding crisis is spelling disaster for the millions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees scattered across the region. The United Nations announced that due to lack of funding, the World Food Programme (WFP) voucher program that feeds 1.7 million Syrian refugees would be suspended. The critical program provided refugees with vouchers to purchase goods from local stores, injecting $800 million into the economies of their host countries. The U.N. said in a statement on Monday that without the WFP, \"many families will go hungry.\" See also: United Nations: Nearly Half the Syrian Population Now Refugees \"For refugees already struggling to survive the harsh winter, the consequences of halting this assistance will be devastating,\" the statement read.  The suspension comes on the heels of a November announcement that the U.N.\\'s refugee agency lacks $58.45 million in funding for its winter preparedness programs. If the gap isn\\'t closed, up to 1 million people displaced across Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey will be without adequate food and shelter as temperatures dip below freezing in the months to come. UNHCR spokesperson Ariane Rummery told Mashable the shortfall comes even after $154 million has been invested on winter aid for refugees in the region, as the size of the refugee crisis has increased exponentially. \"We\\'ve had the speed of displacement pick up, but the funding just continues to trickle in,\" she said. \"To have 1.9 million people displaced inside Iraq in just this year alone is an enormous number of newly displaced people, plus we have another million Syrian refugees this year as well. While we\\'ve had generous funding, the bitter truth is that it’s just not enough.\" The number of refugees who have fled Syria in the last three and a half years of conflict surpassed a record 3 million in August, with an additional 6.5 million people displaced within the country. In September, increasing conflict in Kobani sent hundreds of thousands more people over the border.  Rummery said UNHCR was planning to provide winter aid kits to 1.4 million people, but due to the funding gap, it will only be able to provide the kits for 620,000 people through December. Kits include blankets, winter clothing and extra plastic sheeting to reinforce housing. As it stands, 940,000 people lack basic winter household items, 800,000 people are in need of shelter assistance and 150,000 people will be without heat.  Image: Christopher Mineses/MashableJohn Uniack Davis, the country director for humanitarian organization CARE in Turkey, said the winter crisis is exacerbated by the circumstances under which many refugees fled their homes. \"It’s important to note that when many of these people crossed, it was late September, it was still summer,\" he said. \"Many of them left extremely suddenly, and fled in summer clothes. Now winter is approaching, people left Syria with almost nothing and it gets really cold in the winter in much of the Middle East.\"   On this #GivingTuesday we want to raise awareness of the food crisis in #Jordan, #Lebanon, #Turkey, #Iraq and #Egypt. 1.7 million Syrian refugees are facing a horrible food crisis after the WFP ended its food voucher program. #UNselfie (Image: AP Photo, Mohammed Zaatari) A photo posted by Mashable (@mashable) on Dec 12, 2014 at 1:23pm PST  Two newborn Syrian refugee babies reportedly died of cold in east Lebanon last month, and temperatures are still dropping. In winter\\'s coldest months, temperatures in Northern Syria and Iraq can drop to negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit.  Davis said despite the adversity refugees face, many have shown incredible resilience.  \"What amazes me every time I meet with them is how resilient people are,\" he said. \"The children still play, and people who have been through the most terrible things put on a brave face. They\\'re resilient, they want to put their lives back together, and it would be great if the international community rewarded that courage and did the best they can to support these people.\"  Syrian refugees children play near a snowman in a camp for Syrians who fled their country’s civil war, in the Bekaa valley, eastern Lebanon, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2013.Image: Mohammed ZaatariRummery added that a major international effort is needed to address a problem of this magnitude.  \"This is the biggest refugee crisis of our age,\" she said. \"Because we live in such extraordinary times, we really need government donors and others to find new ways of funding and different solutions to help address this problem.\" ',\n",

Warren/Associated PressIf you\\'re new to the game of soccer, a \"friendly\" is a match that doesn\\'t count on either team\\'s record. Teams play them all the time to try out prospective players or just get in some practice. This is the USMNT\\'s final friendly before World Cup training camp begins, but the American team will play three more just before leaving for Brazil in June. Those matches should feature essentially the final USMNT roster, as manager Jurgen Klinsmann has until June 2 to submit his final 23-man list of players. This match, meanwhile, features a roster made up almost entirely of American players who play professionally in the United States or Mexico (many others play for European clubs). For some, it will be a key chance to impress Klinsmann one more time and hopefully earn an invite to training camp. For others guaranteed a World Cup spot, it\\'s an important opportunity to build chemistry with teammates. So this game may not count, but it definitely matters. ESPN\\'s broadcast starts at 11 p.m. ET. What to watch for  USA\\'s Eddie Johnson, right, and Clint Dempsey, left, celebrate after Johnson scored a goal against Panama during World Cup qualifier soccer match on June 11, 2013, in Seattle.Image: Ted S. Warren/Associated PressWe\\'ll be treated to a preview of three of the USMNT\\'s more important players: Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan. Watch how they read one another and see if they can do some damage together on the attack and in the midfield. If the USMNT is to make some noise in Brazil this summer, it will need all three MLS stalwarts to create scoring chances and control the ball against top-notch competition. Beyond those three stars, Wednesday is also an excellent chance to get a look at some lesser American lights who could nonetheless contribute significantly in Brazil. Among the names to keep an eye on: midfielder Graham Zusi and defender Matt Besler of Sporting Kansas City in MLS, midfielder Maurice Edu of the Philadelphia Union, Los Angeles Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez and DC United striker Eddie Johnson. It\\'s likely that half the USMNT roster will ultimately be made up of MLS players You can read more about the other candidates here. Meanwhile, here\\'s the USMNT\\'s official 2013 highlight video, if you\\'re looking to get pumped up.  What\\'s the deal with this Julian Green kid? The short answer: No one really knows, but we should know more after Wednesday. The longer answer, if you\\'re just catching up: Green is an 18-year-old German-American forward who was born in Tampa but lived almost his entire life in Germany. He plays for Bayern Munich, the world\\'s top club team, but had the option of playing internationally for either the United States or Germany, which has one of the best national teams in the world. In March, Green committed his international future the United States. This is seen as a potentially huge deal for American soccer, as many feel a player with his combination of youth and potential has never before chosen to suit up for the United States over another country.  Bayern Munich\\'s Julian Green, right, challenges an opponent for the ball during a friendly match in Doha, Qatar, on Jan. 9, 2014.Image: Osama Faisal/Associated PressBut is getting Green a move that could simply pay longterm dividends, or might he actually help this summer? No one knows for sure, and some skeptics fear adding him to the final 23-man World Cup roster over a player who\\'s been grinding away for this opportunity for years could disrupt the team\\'s chemistry. Then again, if Green can really add something, it\\'d be stupid to leave him home. Whatever the future holds, Green is all but assured to play against Mexico on Wednesday, giving many USMNT fans their first real look at him in action. The Mexican club that wouldn\\'t DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Orozco are both Americans who play for Puebla F.C. in Mexico\\'s Liga MX. They\\'re both players who Klinsmann called up for Wednesday\\'s friendly. And they\\'re both players Puebla would not release for the match. This didn\\'t make Klinsmann happy, and he took to Twitter (among other places) to vent.  Very disappointed that @PueblaFC did not release DaMarcus Beasley & Michael Orozco. Not in the spirit of this great rivalry! — Jürgen Klinsmann (@J_Klinsmann) March 31, 2014  \\xa0 So what the hell is going on here? Puebla is not legally obligated to release Beasley and Orozco, since Wednesday\\'s match doesn\\'t fall on one of the official international match dates laid out by FIFA (world soccer\\'s governing body). Klinsmann purposely did not call up other American players who play for clubs that have important matches of their own this week. Puebla, however, doesn\\'t play again until Saturday. Puebla, in fact, is doing so poorly this season that it\\'s in danger of being demoted to a lesser Mexican division; trying to avoid that relegation is its best rationalization for keeping the two Americans home. More than likely, however, there\\'s a bit of partisan gamesmanship at play here from the Mexican club. Just because this thing is called a \"friendly\" doesn\\'t mean it\\'s that friendly, after all. A first look at the USMNT\\'s new look The USMNT unveiled its new away kits (that means uniforms, for you soccer n00bs) on Tuesday, and will wear them for the first time on Wednesday against Mexico. (They\\'ll wear them in Brazil, too, along with these previously unveiled home numbers.) Here\\'s what the brand-new away kits look like, as modeled by Clint Dempsey:  New @ussoccer away kit, #USMNT will wear it in Brazil this summer for #WorldCup + vs MEX tmrw http://t.co/UciMvATnRH pic.twitter.com/AcqduNae50 — Sam Laird (@samcmlaird) April 1, 2014  \\xa0 Many online were quick to dismiss the jerseys as looking vaguely Russian, or resembling a classic brand of popsicle. We don\\'t think they look so bad at all, but are curious to see them on the field Wednesday. Now back to that World Cup we mentioned ...  USA\\'s Michael Bradley stands during player introductions before a World Cup qualifier soccer match against Panama on June 11, 2013, in Seattle.Image: Ted S. Warren/Associated PressThis match is important in many ways, but don\\'t take any positive or negatives from it too seriously. Coming from their regular professional clubs, this batch of USMNT players won\\'t have practiced together much before kickoff, and that will likely show a bit. Similarly, there are many big names — Jozy Altidore and Tim Howard, for example — not playing so Klinsmann can get a better look at others based closer to home. And the Mexican squad won\\'t be at full-strength either. All that being said, it\\'s definitely worth keeping an eye on what\\'s ahead for both countries. The United States finished first in the two countries\\' shared regional qualifying group, while Mexico surprisingly needed a playoff win over New Zealand to reach the World Cup. But the United States was unfortunate to get a tougher draw when pool-play foursomes were decided, landing alongside Germany, Portugal and Ghana in Group G. Mexico, meanwhile, landed in a Group A with host country Brazil, Croatia and Cameroon. The USMNT\\'s Group G is already being called this year\\'s \"Group of Death,\" but Mexico\\'s draw is no cakewalk either. Suffice to say, both sides could use all the practice they can get before the World Cup starts June 12 — practice that begins Wednesday night against one another.   Never Forget the USMNT\\'s 1994 World Cup Kits        1. Known as \"the Denim Kit,\" the jerseys were made to look like denim. Yes, denim. Why? Because denim signifies America, of course.  Shown here: United States national team forward Eric Wynalda (11), right, is congratulated by teammates after scoring the first USMNT goal in a 1994 World Cup group-play match against Switzerland, on June 18, 1994.

The United States defeated Colombia 2-1.   Image: Lois Bernstein/Associated Press         3. The kits were designed by Adidas. But, before settling on the denim versions, a tie-dye concept was considered, according to a 2011 interview with Adidas product manager Drew Gardner.  That. Would. Have. Been. Awesome. Shown here: United States defender Thomas Dooley, right, hits a header off a corner kick over two Romanian players during a World Cup group-pay match on Sunday, June 26, 1994.

The 1994 home versions were a bit more understated. But, because the United States hosted in \\'94, the USMNT only wore the starry away numbers once, for its Round of 16 elimination loss to Brazil on July 4. Now, was that sad result just a simple coincidence? You be the judge.

A new one: using Glass as a support system for people with Parkinson’s disease. See also: Google Glass Is Great for Some Jobs, Google Points Out Researchers at Newcastle University in England believe that Glass can provide automated reminders in a user’s field of vision. “We’re looking at the ways in which people with Parkinson’s can use this technology to provide them with prompts whilst they’re out, reminders, and to help them live more independently,\" said Dr. John Vines, senior research associate at the Digital Interaction group at Newcastle\\'s Culture Lab, in a video. Plus, compared to other aids, Google Glass is relatively discreet.  “The last thing we want is a system of cueing which is so obvious it adds to people’s overall embarrassment,\" said Roisin McNaney, a Ph.D. student who is part of the research team. \"Wearable computing is still quite novel but as more people buy into the technology … systems such as Glass offer us a real opportunity.\" The team of researchers will present its findings at the Conference of Human Factors in Computing Systems later this month.

       " ' Justin Smith has taken the first major steps in his revamp of Bloomberg Media with the hiring of former AOL Live president Nathan Richardson and Inside.com chief content officer Gabriel Snyder. Richardson and Snyder will oversee the creation and launch of new digital efforts that were touted recently by a strategy plan that Smith penned following his first 100 days as CEO of Bloomberg Media. See also: 12 Facebook Statuses You Need to Retire Snyder and Richardson will be tasked with figuring out how to take the work of more than 2,400 journalists in more than 150 bureaus on innovative platforms for new readers. \"Our strategy calls for building out a portfolio of new digital assets that better align our content offerings to global business audience segments,\" Smith wrote. \"This realignment will help us go bolder and deeper, signaling to consumers outside of finance that Bloomberg has the media products for them, while providing advertisers with a more targeted way to reach their most important audiences.\" Richardson joins Bloomberg after a short run as president of AOL Live, a project that has been put on hold since his exit. Before that, he founded Waywire and helped launch Gilt Man and Gilt City. He said Bloomberg was well-positioned to take advantage of growing demand for business news from emerging markets by creating new platforms for its existing content and data tools. \"I think that just the growth numbers in terms of digital, in terms of the numbers of people coming in online globally, not just domestically... are astounding,\" Richardson told Mashable. \"Those people may historically know Bloomberg as an investing tool for people in the investment community. In reality, the digital assets that Bloomberg has are really powerful for a business decision maker.\" Snyder leaves Inside.com after less than three months as the company\\'s chief content officer; he oversaw the launch of its news aggregation app. Snyder, who previously served as editor of Gawker as well as Atlantic Media\\'s The Wire, echoed Richardson\\'s sentiments. \"The opportunity for growth is looking for those new content types and story forms that are specifically tailored for this new emerging era of a digital first, mobile-dominant news environment,\" Snyder said. The hirings are two of the most high-profile moves since Smith took the helm of Bloomberg Media in July after moving from The Atlantic, where he transformed the once-analog media property into a popular digital destination. Richardson and Snyder both said their work would be keen to take risks on new ideas that might stir some initial doubt, but relished the opportunity to stir things up at a company that has not taken many risks since purchasing Businessweek in 2009. \"I\\xa0think that anytime you\\'re doing something that\\'s new, there\\'s a certain amount of uncertainty,\" Richardson said. \"The fear of the unknown is probably one of the challenges we have to manage against and not letting that stand in our way because the appetite at Bloomberg to make this a great differentiated product and service is immense.\" ',\n",
       " ' Twitter has already proven to be a popular tool for talking about TV shows, and soon, the platform will become a way to watch shows, too.  NBCUniversal and Comcast announced Wednesday that they have entered into a partnership with Twitter that will let \"millions\" of Xfinity TV customers view TV shows and movies via tweets through a new feature called See It. See also: The History of Twitter, From Egg to IPO \"See It will be integrated into a show’s tweet, so that with the click of a button, I can change the channel on my TV right away, record it or even watch on my mobile device,\" Sam Schwartz, Comcast\\'s chief business development officer, said in a blog post.  The See It button, which will start showing up in tweets later this year, will let customers tune into shows online or  from set top boxes, set their DVRs and even buy tickets through Fandango. NBCUniversal\\'s networks like CNBC, SyFy, NBC and others will have access to the feature, for shows including The Voice, Today Show, Access Hollywood and many more. While subscribers will have access to more options, non-subscribers will also be able to use the See It button to see shows they might be able to access through other apps from places like Hulu or ABC. Here\\'s a mockup of how the service will work when it launches:  \"Twitter is where television viewers come to talk about what they’re watching on TV when they’re watching it,\" Dick Costolo, Twitter\\'s CEO, said in a statement. \"Millions of users are exposed to the live conversation that unfolds on Twitter while a show is on the air and now, with See It,they’ll be able to tune in directly from a Tweet.\" Twitter has been looking to boost its TV network partnerships in recent months to get a piece of the lucrative TV ad business as it gears up to become a public company.

       " \" Quitting your job takes guts. Besides leaping into unknown territory, you ultimately have to break the news to your boss, too. Intimidating stuff. You can take the classy road and quietly, gracefully file your two week’s notice. You can take the angry route, which includes but is not limited to destroying everything in sight, screaming hysterically and lighting things on fire. Then there's the sneaky way, in which you walk out one day and never look back. (Bonus: Coworkers will ponder what happened, and you’ll become the mysterious, exotic office legend.) See also: The Millennial's Guide to Personal Finance No matter how you do it (hint: do it the first way), you have to form a plan. Here are seven ways Millennials in particular should prepare to quit their jobs, when necessary.  Image: Flickr, 401(K) 2012 1. Plan Financially As a young person in the workforce, you probably haven't built a cushy savings to support yourself while hunting for another opportunity.  Therefore, it’s important to take a good, hard look at your finances and calculate how long you can cover rent, food and other basic human needs with the budget you have saved. This is all the more imperative if you've stacked up student loans.  Take a look at your daily expenses and figure out what you could live without when push comes to shove. It’s amazing how you can survive without that daily Starbucks habit.  2. Look for Other Jobs It can take months to nail down a job. Remember how long it took you to land the gig you’re quitting? It's important to remain patient. The economy may be tough, but with social media, resume tools and employment sites like Monster, CareerBuilder and Indeed, finding available jobs is easier than ever. Plus, if you went to college, look for a campus career center available to alumni. You can even find jobs on Twitter, just by typing search terms or hashtags like “hiring” and “job application.” Image: Flickr, mhkmarketing 3. Change Your Twitter Handle Speaking of Twitter, maybe you took so much pride in your job that you changed your Twitter handle to “@MashableYohana.” Sorry, but that will look bizarre to future employers. Stick to something simple, like your first and last name.  On that note, keep your public social media activity professional. Your old boss might not have cared about your way-too-personal tweets, but potential employers will balk and wipe your name from their lists. 4. Back Up Your Data When you leave your job, most of your data goes with it. That means emails, documents, contacts and anything else acquired through company usernames and passwords. You didn’t do all that work for nothing, so take out some time, grab a flash drive or a cloud account and save what you need to save. Note: That does not mean stealing confidential data or informational perks only afforded to actual employees. You don’t want to end up jobless and in legal trouble.  Image: Flickr, Woodley Wonderworks 5. Say Thank You If you’re quitting to move on to greener pastures, remain polite and grateful to your former coworkers and employers. They could be useful contacts, and can often serve as references for future jobs. Make sure your boss knows how much you appreciated working there — a meaningful thank you note goes a long way.  6. Consider the Unconventional As a Millennial, it’s hard not to look at the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and weep. Give it a positive spin and let it inspire you, instead. Maybe you were meant to start a small business, a startup or a blog. (Yep, thousands of people make a comfortable living just by blogging.) It’s the 21st century, the golden age of unconventional careers. Image: Flickr, hslo 7. Really Think About Why You're Quitting Look, just because you majored in engineering or art history does not mean your career destiny is set in stone. Analyze why you left your last job and think, “Is this what I want to do with my life?” Chances are if you quit your last job and find another one just like it, you might end up unhappily turning in another pink slip. As much as you value a certain company on your resume, that accolade alone does not equate to true fulfillment.  This is the time to try new things and acquire new skills, so carpe diem, Millenials.

Drones are a big part of our lives, whether we see them or not. Drone Beat collects the best and most important stories every week. Drone Beat\\'s coverage areas this week  Last update: July 24, 5:32 p.m. ET Obama will reportedly issue an executive order on drone privacy President Barack Obama is going to issue an executive order asking a government agency to draft privacy guidelines regulating the use of commercial drones in U.S. airspace, according to Politico. Obama would pick the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an arm of the Commerce Department, as the agency in charge of developing these guidelines — not the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that\\'s in charge of drafting rules for the integration of drones into American airspace. Under the NTIA\\'s lead, companies and consumer groups would try to agree on a series of \"voluntary best practices,\" Politico reported. The White House, the FAA and the NTIA declined to comment on the report. However, Brendan Schulman, a lawyer with Kramer Levin who specializes in drone cases, told Mashable that the FAA is getting snubbed in this case because the agency \"never had a mandate concerning privacy, and in Congressional hearings has indicated that it would look to other agencies to develop any necessary privacy policies for commercial drones.\" There aren\\'t a lot of details about the potential executive order yet, but this move could appease the concern of some privacy advocates, who have often criticized the FAA for not tackling privacy issues.  Drone pilot saves man\\'s life David Lesh, an amateur drone pilot, saved the life of 82-year-old Guillermo DeVenecia, who had been missing for three days.

On Sunday, Lesh, using only a small drone, found him after 20 minutes. \"We weren\\'t really sure what we would find or what kind of shape he would be in if we did find him... I don\\'t think any of us expected to find him,\" he said.  Japan is building a huge drone fleet After World War II, Japan agreed to let the United States take on the responsibility of defending the country if it was ever attacked, virtually giving up its own military. But now, Japan is militarizing again. And, as part of this effort, it\\'s building a large fleet of drones.  The country will spend approximately $372 million in the next 10 years to buy flying robots, according to Quartz. This investment is aimed at reestablishing Japan\\'s military might amid growing tensions with China over a series of disputed islands.  Such an investment would make Japan the fastest growing unmanned aerial vehicle program in the world. On the other hand, even with such a large force, the country would simply be joining what\\'s becoming a rather crowded club. Other than the United States, several other countries, including China, Israel, India and even Iran, already have drones in their arsenals.

       " '     As tensions, and the death toll, continue to rise and Israeli forces move further into Gaza, two students at Hunter College in New York have found a way to spread love at a time when it\\'s so easy to hate. Abraham Gutman and Dania Darwish created a Twitter hashtag campaign, #JewsandArabsRefuseToBeEnemies, and Facebook page after Israeli military forces launched Operation Protective Edge and advanced into Gaza on July 8 — an offensive that has led to the death of more than 680 Palestinians, according to an AP report. The same report put the Israeli death toll since the start of hostilities at 31.  See also: In Pictures, Worldwide Protests Against Israeli Military Action in Gaza In an editorial for the Christian Science Monitor, Gutman, who is Israeli, wrote that he and classmate Darwish, who is Syrian, originally talked about organizing demonstrations or meet-ups about the situation in Israel and Gaza.  But the duo eventually looked to other forms of activism, knowing that they wanted to use the slogan \"Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies,\" used by peaceful groups in Israel for years, in whatever they decided to do.  @Ibishblog check out our initiative ! #JewsAndArabsRefuseToBeEnemies pic.twitter.com/JWEvliXbxo — Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) July 21, 2014  \\xa0 As vitriol and anger began to rise not only in the region, but online and throughout social media, they \"thought it would be productive to remind people that they are allowed to refuse to join the hateful discourse.\" \"They are allowed to respect each other, and they are allowed to disagree and remain civil,\" Gutman wrote. \"Because we were afraid that a demonstration would become a shouting match between \\'pro this\\' and \\'pro that\\' groups, we thought that starting a social media campaign would be more productive.\"  He calls me neshama, I call him habibi.

But Gutman said he was surprised by how the campaign failed to spread as quickly as he had anticipated because people were afraid to join. People reached out to Gutman and Darwish noting that they supported the campaign, but that they were scared of what their community might think should they post a photo embracing the positive message. \"When people in democratic countries are scared of stating publicly that they won’t be another person’s enemy, you know there is something extremely wrong. In the States, both Jewish and Muslim Americans expressed concern over the reaction of their communities. What if they seemed inconsiderate or insensitive? I got the same reactions from both Arab and Jewish friends in Israel. \\'I liked the page, but I am sorry, I don’t think I can do more than that. But thank you for doing this!\\' is a very common reaction.\" The #JewsandArabsRefuseToBeEnemies hashtag has since spread across the globe, however, with people prolifically sharing their stories and photos of unity amid the crisis.

       " ' You\\'ve heard of the curse of the sophomore slump, right? It\\'s lore that dates back centuries (or, you know, as long as people cared about TV shows) : A show, so brilliant and bold in its first season, enters Season 2 only to find all the charm that first made it a success gone like a headless man in the night. See also: 18 New TV Shows to Watch This Fall Considering the twisty and wonderful tales that Sleepy Hollow dished out in its first season, it was fair to enter this sophomore year with concerns. But if Monday\\'s season premiere did anything — besides change the way we saw Benjamin Franklin forever — it was prove that this train shows no signs of slowing down. Executive producer Mark Goffman told Mashable prior to the premiere that it was their intention to do exactly that. But, as is often the case, the divide between intentions and execution is sometimes gaping. But he liked to think their finale gave them a running start. With Abbie (Nicole Beharie) trapped in Purgatory, Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) poised to suffocate in a box, Katrina (Katia Winter) captured by Headless, possibly few dead beloved faces and the arrival of War (John Noble), the hanging threads to be picked up were numerous — and all filled with possibilities. \"It is such rich material that it\\'s been the fuel and a major drive for the season,\" he said. \"I feel like we have so many great elements to work with. We have a lot of good territory to cover and a lot of drama to play out.\"  \"Don\\'t be such a prude, Ichabod.\" — Benjamin FranklinImage:  Mashable; FoxThat journey began Monday night, with an episode that saw the aforementioned debut of the arrogant and, as Crane described, \"insufferable\" Founding Father, whose research in the supernatural world helped Ichabod find a solution to his trapped partner\\'s plight. (It was a key that opens the door to purgatory; thus, bypassing the soul-for-a-soul rule.) It was as rich of an introduction as one could have hoped, but also one of a few things that instilled confidence about the series trajectory. Here are some others: More John Noble War, what is he good for? In this case, absolutely everything. As ruthless War, the restraints that were put on John Noble\\'s character in much of Season 1 in the name of selling the Innocent Sin Eater ruse are off, resulting in a truly menacing villain that can play as he wishes in the space of a new season. And, judging by the final minutes, Moloch is going to be around to help him reach his true evil potential. If that\\'s not exciting, I don\\'t know what is.  Henry (John Noble) has a new plan in \\'This is War,\\' the season premiere of \\'Sleepy Hollow.\\'Image:  Brownie Harris/FOXThe stakes have been raised Think last season\\'s fight against a horse-riding dude with no head got intense? Two words: Demon army. At one point, Abbie learned from Andy (R.I.P,; we miss you) in Purgatory that Moloch is on the search for the key because he wanted to unleash every damned baddie onto Earth to help start the end of days. Luckily, they prevent that from happening, but as Abbie said at the end of the episode, \"We may have stopped Moloch today, but he\\'s still down there.\" Ichabod agreed. \"War has begun in earnest. Today was merely an opening salvo.\" The same can seemingly be said of the show\\'s entire first season; it was just the start. At this point, we know this world, we\\'ve lived in it and we love it — but the writers are seemingly ready to flip this it upside down, beat it up and take its lunch money. And that\\'s exciting. Most importantly, \\'Ichabbie\\' The season premiere kicked off by welcoming the lovers of the show\\'s central pair back to the party with a literal party. Abbie\\'s \"surprise party\" for Crane was always too good to be true — everyone knew the sweet scene would turn out to be a day dream of some sort — but in the moment, we were willing to take it at face value. Why is this and several other heart-warming moments a good sign for the season, though? Because it shows that the series has not gotten lost in its mythology. It remains at its core a story about two complicated heroes brought together by fate to wage a battle that will test them in unthinkable ways but also allow them to forge a friendship of the ages. In other words, it\\'s freaking beautiful. As long as the show never loses sight of that, we\\'re in good shape.  \"What? We just stare at it?\" — IchabodImage:  Mashable; Fox \\'We are survivors, you and I\\' — Ichabod.Image:  Mashable; Fox \"The Bible foretells two witnesses. You and I must remain together if there is any hope of victory. The only risk, Leftenant, is in leaving you behind.\" — IchabodImage:  Mashable; Fox ',\n",
       " ' Google has earned a reputation for posing brain-teasing questions to interviewees in order to ensure that only the best and brightest make it through its ranks. But according to a new survey, Google isn\\'t the toughest job interview out there. The career site Glassdoor, which bases its data on reviews from anonymous workers, found that Google was the eighth hardest place to interview. No. 1 was awarded to consulting firm McKinsey & Company. See also: 13 Questions to Ask During Your Next Interview In addition to Google, the rest of the top 10 ranked in the following order: ThoughtWorks, Boston Consulting Group, Gartner, Bain & Co., Rolls-Royce, ZS Associates, Stryker and HubSpot. Other tech companies in the top 25 included Microsoft (16), Citrix (19) and Facebook (22). The survey not only showed that consultants tend to have the most rigorous screening process, but also revealed that the average interview time has swelled from 12 days in 2010 to 23 days so far in 2013. Your wait will likely be longer if you\\'re interviewing at one of the companies on the list. At McKinsey, for instance, the average interview time is 39 days. Google makes you wait 37 and Facebook\\'s process takes a comparatively brief 30 days.  On the bright side, Google has recently nixed its job interview riddles, which were the subject of at least one book. \"On the hiring side, we found that brainteasers are a complete waste of time,\" Laszlo Bock, Google\\'s SVP of people operations, said in an interview with the New York Times. \"They don\\'t predict anything.

       " \" The Ice Bucket Challenge, which has dominated Facebook News Feeds with videos of people dumping ice water on themselves in support of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research, has raised more than $100 million for the ALS Association since it gained traction at the end of July. But the movement has its detractors, and many wonder how many participants have actually learned about the disease, rather than simply jumping on the viral bandwagon. New data from the Wikimedia Foundation sheds some positive light, however, indicating that an increased number of people have at least searched for more information about the neurodegenerative disease. The ALS Wikipedia page in English was viewed 2.89 million times in August; that's compared to an average of only 163,300 times per month between January 2013 and July 2014 — marking an 18-fold increase. See also: 8 Bucket Challenges That Don't Involve Any Ice The page in other languages saw increases as well, including a 59-fold increase in Chinese-language page views and a 14-fold increase in Spanish-language page views.  Image: StatistaStatistics portal Statista used a beta tool that tracks monthly page views on Wikipedia, culled from the Wikimedia Foundation's raw data. For the record, ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, leading to paralysis, vital organ failure and death. Promising research has shown that certain treatments can slow its progression, but an estimated 30,000 Americans still live with ALS at any given time. You can learn more about the disease at the ALA Foundation's website. BONUS: What Is ALS and the Ice Bucket Challenge? | Mashable Explains  \",\n",
       " ' Having mixed feelings about your iPhone 5, 5S or 5C? Maybe the screen doesn\\'t seem to shine as brightly, or the hyper-responsive touch screen doesn\\'t seem as fast as it once was. Whatever the reason, you\\'re looking for a change. If you\\'re the type of person who always needs the newest iPhone as soon as it comes out, chances are you\\'re looking to sell your current device — and quickly. We can help. See also: 4 Ways to Recycle Your Old Gadgets There are several options available, and you can explore each one to find the best value for your old device. Below, we\\'ve detailed a few of the best options and how to utilize them. 1. Apple\\'s Trade-In Program Image: Mashable Apple offers its own in-house trade-in program. At any Apple retail store, you can provide your phone (all iPhone generations are currently accepted) and an Apple employee will determine its monetary value. If you choose to accept their quote, they\\'ll credit you with your quote amount, take your iPhone and wipe it while you search the store for your next device. Important note: The device for which you\\'re trading your current model must be in stock at the time of your trade-in, and new phones must be under contract. The Apple trade-in program method is safe and easy, but it isn\\'t likely to get you the best price for your former phone.  2. Amazon\\'s Trade-In Program  Image: Screenshot, AmazonAmazon\\'s trade-in program offers, on average, a higher price than Apple. Users who want to get rid of their current iPhones simply need to fill out a form about the quality of their devices. Amazon then sends you packing and shipping materials free of charge. When the company receives your shipment, your account will be credited with a gift card of equal value.  3. Walmart\\'s Trade-In Program  Image: Screenshot, WalmartMajor retailer Walmart also has a trade-in program. For working phones, Walmart offers as much as $180.50 credit for an iPhone 5, $325 credit for an iPhone 5S, and $133 for an iPhone 5C. 4. Direct Sale Sites  Image: Screenshot, GlydeIn terms of sites dedicated to helping you sell your iPhone directly, you have quite a few options.  Glyde.com is probably your best bet in terms of sheer price. You set a price on your device and wait for someone to make the purchase. Once sold, you receive the payment in your Glyde account, which you can easily transfer to a bank account. The site even has an iPhone Upgrade Tool to help you figure out how much of a profit you can expect after upgrading. For a charitable and environmentally friendly approach, RebootCharity.org pays you for your iPhone, which it will then recycle. According to the website, profits are used to \"fund the work of volunteers.\" Surprisingly, GameStop offers a pretty good deal in terms of store credit value. Gamers can receive store credit up to $229 for a like-new iPhone 5, $319 for an iPhone 5S and $199 for an iPhone 5C. You can also trade in your device for cash, but it isn\\'t as much as in-store credit.  When it comes to selling your iPhone directly, we recommend that you research different sites independently and think about what you\\'d like to get in return. Your iPhone\\'s value is dependent on many factors, including your carrier and the device\\'s physical condition. If you\\'re constantly looking to get the newest phone on the market, we recommend looking into your carrier\\'s upgrade programs. Many programs, such as T-Mobile\\'s JUMP, Verizon\\'s Edge and AT&T\\'s Next, allow you to upgrade more frequently.

       " ' So you have a great product, platform or business that you’re stoked to start up. It can be an exciting and thrilling opportunity to get your own company up and running, but it’s also filled with stress and anxiety — that road can be full of obstacles and a lot of confusion. Well, first things first: Have you done your business plan yet? It sounds trite, but the business plan is really the roadmap to success. When done correctly and thoroughly, that document can not only put you on track to proper growth and healthy strategies, but it can also be the perfect way to introduce your company to potential investors. Here’s a list of guidelines that will help you craft the right business plan for your organization. Keep in mind: All businesses are unique and have their own specific challenges that must be met. But, if you stick with these characteristics, you will already be miles ahead from where you started. What’s your business plan must-have? Let us know in the comments. 1. Keep It Brief Many people consider a business plan to be the novelization of their ideal path to creating a company, jamming all hopes, dreams and projected profits into a pages-long document that, frankly, no one is interested in reading. A business plan doesn’t have to be filled with everything you’ve ever wanted in your business — it just needs to be straightforward. “People think that a business plan needs to be a multi-page document that’s poetic in nature, and that’s not the case,\" says Barbara Findlay Schenck, author of Business Plans Kit For Dummies. “What you need to have is a piece of paper that details the main things that will keep your business on course.” Schenck says the myth of the business plan as a lengthy document doesn’t match reality. In fact, just writing down the basics of your business is enough to think about your company’s pathway clearly, and how exactly you or your team will move forward. Business plan specialist Greg Goodman agrees that excessive detail in a business plan, including month over month statistics or intense data projections, can not only be a burden on the company but also set unrealistic expectations for investors. An even worse mistake can be a business plan that includes a restrictive NDA. “There’s a great grey area, and most VCs I’ve encountered will not sign one,” Goodman says. “They’re not going to sign it because they have the same liability issues as a company looking at an outside product. What if they’re already looking at developing it internally? Do they want to get sued by someone from Pennsylvania who thinks they have the greatest thing since sliced bread, but in fact they’re duplicative of something they’re already working on? It’s not worth it to them.” 2. But, Still Be Thorough Simple doesn’t mean sparse — the best business plan will be diligent in outlining the characteristics of the company that are most important. Hammering down the basics of your business, everything from a personnel onboarding plan to securing the proper name rights and trademarks, will ensure no important detail is left unchecked. In her book, Schenck says that there are must-do tasks to make the business plan a useful document:  Describe the business. Describe the product or service. Describe the competitive environment of the product. Describe how the business will make money through a business model. Describe how to market the business. Describe how you’re going to produce the product. Describe the business team, whether it’s you or a small team. Describe the financial projection, including how much money you need and how much money you will profit.  These tentpole concepts may seem obvious to some, but Schenck says she is surprised at how often these characteristics are missing from business plans of all kinds. “It’s amazing how many businesses start without that knowledge and fail without that knowledge,” Schenck says. Goodman says that even though it’s trite, the “roadmap” analogy is the most accurate way to approach the development of a business plan. By outlining all of the major points and remaining stringent about your details, you can have a solid pathway without the need for unnecessary details — and perhaps learn more about your own business in the process. “You always should have a business plan just so that you guide your own steps,” Goodman explains. “The reality is that it has a certain value — it’s not just plotting out Step A to Step B to Step C. Once you start putting details on paper, you see stuff you wouldn’t have seen otherwise.” 3. Uniqueness Speaks Volumes No two businesses are alike, so business plans are not one-size-fits-all. Although it may be tempting to rip off a boilerplate business plan or to copy the plan from a successful business, that denies you the ability to address the unique challenges of your particular company. Worse, an untailored business plan is an easy way to set yourself up for failure. “The business plan needs to mirror the proposed business endeavor,” Goodman explains. “So, what goes into it is everything that is necessary to depict that particular proposition, whether it’s a candy store or some high-tech venture.” Goodman says that when writing a business plan, it’s important to write to your particular audience. If the business plan is a strictly internal document meant to keep the performance and growth of your company on track, then it should emphasize internal information that will help that (such as hiring order or important partnerships). If the business plan is an external document, then it’s all about writing about your business as attractively as possible to get investors intrigued. “Even seasoned people don’t necessarily get that you need to think about who is reading your document,” Goodman says. “Your audience is different, and your audience can only be judged in relationship to yourself. If you’re Joe or Susie Smith and nobody knows your background, you need to write differently and make a different pitch for venture firms.” Schenck says understanding the nature of the business is key to producing a great business plan. It’s important for founders to think about the purpose of the business, what they’re selling, who their audience is, and how it will make money. Those are questions that need to be answered right on paper, although Schenck asserts many businesses can’t answer them right away. “These questions can be answered on the back of a napkin for all I care, but when you’ve answered them, you’re in business.” Schenck says. “Those questions answer what you’re doing, who you’re doing it for, how you’re doing it and how you’re going to make money doing it.” Remember, your business is unique and deserves special care when crafting a plan for success. Making a fair assessment of your needs and planning accordingly will ensure that your plan is stable enough to get you off the ground. Image via istockphoto, fotostorm ',\n",

Editor\\'s Note: The awarding of Mashable Choice to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 applies only to the 8-inch model. If Samsung\\'s aim was to supply cheaper alternatives to Apple\\'s iPad and iPad mini as a way of gaining elusive tablet market share, it succeeded with its recent 10.1- and 8-inch Tab 3 tablets. But when I say \"cheaper,\" I mean inferior for one of the Tab 3s and merely \"less expensive\" for the other. Three feature additions mark this third generation of Samsung tablets (which also includes a 7-inch model that we didn\\'t get a chance to test):  The company has finally ditched its ridiculous proprietary charge/sync jack in favor of the near-universal microUSB. An IR emitter and the company\\'s WatchON program guide app lets you use the tablet as an advanced TV remote. The addition of a few of the most prominent features from its popular Galaxy S4 smartphones.  See also: Facebook for Android: 10 Tips for Power Users As far as the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is concerned, these improvements and its low price ($399.99, marked down to $379.99) do not make up for fatal camera and shortcomings with screen resolutions and battery life. But these fresh attributes combined with its low $299.99 price makes the 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3 a worthy –- and only –- alternative to the iPad mini at $30 more. Physical Features Samsung\\'s ongoing tablet quality perception problems stems from their plastic housing, especially on the 10.1 model. On the larger tablet, the thin, light plastic casing makes the tablet feel flimsy and, yes, cheap, especially when compared to iPad.  The casing differences between the 8-inch Tab 3 compared to the iPad mini are not as stark, although its looks are more readily marred by visible fingerprints, at least on the black versions.  Unlike the iPad, Samsung recognizes you\\'ll use its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet mostly in landscape mode rather than portrait. Like Samsung\\'s previous Tab incarnations, the Tab 3 10.1\\'s Home button is beneath the screen when held horizontally, and buttons for on/off and volume as well as the microSD card slot are located on the opposite top perimeter. One unwelcome change between the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and the Tab 3 10.1 is the speaker placement. On the previous-generation Galaxy Tabs, the twin stereo speakers faced front on either side of the screen. But for the Tab 3 the speakers are moved to the rim, which means you may block one or both with your hands when you hold the device. While nearly exactly as flat as the iPad mini (0.28 inches thin), the 0.27 inch thin Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is about a half inch taller than the mini and a half-inch less wide. The practical benefit is pocketability. While both fit in most jacket pockets, Tab 3 8.0\\'s slightly slimmer profile makes it less snug of a fit, so it slips in and out a little more smoothly. Like the iPad mini, the Tab 3 8.0\\'s twin speakers are placed on the bottom rim, the same arrangement as on the 7-inch Tab 2, which means you hear movie sound only through one side. Other less technically adept tablet makers have managed to place speakers on either side of the screen, so it\\'s a bit annoying when a tablet maker with market-leadership aspirations doesn\\'t. Screen Sights Both Tab 3s feature 1,280 x 800 screens, which good news for the 8 inch model — you get 189 pixels per inch (ppi), higher than iPad mini\\'s 163 ppi (although a Retina iPad Mini is rumored). But this resolution is bad news for the 10.1 Tab 3. With its larger screen, the 10.1 provides only 149 ppi. As a result, standard text fonts on ebooks and web pages are fuzzy and sometimes noticeably jagged, and tiny text on full HTML pages is nearly indecipherable.  Samsung has added 0.1-inch of screen area to the 8-incher compared to the 7.9-inch screen on the iPad mini, which amounts to nothing. But Tab 3 8.0\\'s screen is more oblong, which means widescreen movies actually appear larger since the screen\\'s shape conforms more closely to a widescreen movie, lessening the letterboxing effect you\\'d get on the iPad mini. A taller screen means you also get longer Web pages and, depending on the font, font size and line spacing, you get a couple of extra lines per page while e-reading, which translates into fewer page turns than on smaller screen tablets. The Tablet as Your Remote Control All three Tab 3s are joining a small fraternity of tablets with a built-in infrared (IR) emitter for AV remote control. Pre-installed on all three is Samsung\\'s WatchON app (and, oddly, the similar Peel Smart Remote app) to control your TV and cable/satellite set-top box and make viewing suggestions. Via Wi-Fi, you can also switch content between tablet and smart TV and vice versa using a Samsung-specific Wi-Fi-based technology (not Miracast). While I understand moving content from tablet to TV, I\\'m not sure under what conditions you\\'d do the reverse. The IR blaster on both the 8- and 10.1-inch Tab 3s are located along the horizontal rim — logical for the larger tablet but not for the smaller since, as previously noted, it\\'s laid out to be held vertically. It\\'d also be easier to handle and manipulate the 8-incher with one hand if the IR blaster were at the top rather the side.  Personally, I\\'m not a fan of touchscreen remote controls – you can\\'t operate them without looking at them. And because of their size, especially on the 10.1, a tablet makes an even more awkward touchscreen remote. WatchON is handy to get a capsule of what\\'s currently on TV and, after you set some favorites, what you might find interesting to watch coming up. But WatchON is ultimately neutered as an everyday tool because it doesn\\'t offer full remote replacement — it controls ONLY your TV and set-top box, no other A/V components. And compared to other remote controls, the tablet\\'s otherwise adequate battery life limits its daily usefulness. Samsung Features and Apps Among the Galaxy S4 functions ported to these tabs are the Siri-like S Voice, photo organizer and photo book creator Story Album and the traveler-must-have S Translator (although this app is handier on a handset than on a tablet).  While there\\'s no eye-tracking Smart Pause or Smart Scrolling, supposedly the screens on both tablets stay lit as long as you\\'re looking at it — except for me, apparently. I kept getting an \"Eyes Not Detected\" message. Was it my glasses? In addition to the usual Android Google Play app store is Samsung\\'s own Samsung Apps store. Why two app stores? You may have heard Android is rife with malware, many transported to your device via open apps from less than reputable sources in third-party app stores. A few malware apps have even showed up in Google Play. Samsung\\'s own app store is, like Apple\\'s App Store, curated, which means the apps within are safe for worry-free downloading. Plus, the Samsung app store recommends apps that are optimized for your specific Samsung device. Performance Each of the Tabs is endowed with a quad-core processor, a 1.6GHz in the 10.1 and a 1.5GHz in the 8. While the Tab 3 8.0 ran smoothly, the 10.1 seemed occasionally... hesitant. There were infrequent, barely perceptible, almost subconscious, lags between tapping and action, sort as if the Tab 3 wanted to take a breath before reacting. While both tabs sport 1.3-megapixel front-facing imagers, the 8-incher includes a barely adequate 5MP rear camera, and the 10.1 a wholly inadequate 3.2MP. It\\'s stunning and disappointing to find any modern mobile device, and especially one from a company as esteemed as Samsung, to offer such a low-resolution camera.  The most noticeable performance difference between the two Tab 3s is battery life. While the 8-incher lasts for a respectable 9 hours or so, the 10.1 didn\\'t last even five hours, a totally woeful and unacceptable life-span, regardless of price or additional functions. Split Tab If you\\'re looking for an Android alternative to the slightly more expensive Apple iPad mini, I heartily recommend the Tab 3 8.0. But with its short battery life, low screen resolution, in adequate camera and noticeable lag, the 10.1 Tab 3 is a disappointment. The Lowdown Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 What\\'s Good:  Lightweight IR blaster for TV remote  What\\'s Bad:  Lame camera Low-resolution screen Noticeable lag  Samsung Tab 3 8.0 What\\'s Good:  More pocketable than iPad mini Higher ppi than iPad mini IR blaster for TV remote  What\\'s Bad: speakers mounted on one side Bottom Line: The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 challenges the iPad mini with a slightly better screen and a somewhat useful remote-control ability, but the 10.1-inch version is a poor tablet whose screen, camera and overall performance are lacking.

       " ' When Category 3 Tropical Cyclone Hudhud came ashore in India near the city of Visakhapatnam on Oct. 12, it did far more than just damage buildings and flood coastal areas, which are typical types of tropical cyclone damage. It also led to a natural disaster that is rarely associated with tropical cyclones: a deadly blizzard and associated avalanches. The blizzard struck Nepal on Tuesday on the Annapurna circuit, a popular hiking route that is not as demanding as the Mount Everest trek. As a result, many of the climbers may not have been the elite mountaineers, who have more experience in challenging conditions. So far, 27 people, including many foreigners, are confirmed dead, with at least 70 people still missing. The death toll is expected to rise.

View of Annapurna III from the village of Pisang, Nepal.Image: Flickr, Le photo Ã\\xa0 Go-GoThe cyclone hit during the height of the annual mountaineering season, when adventurers from around the world attempt to climb the tallest peaks. Typically, the weather in mid-October is clear and cool, so the blizzard likely caught climbers and their guides, known as sherpas, off guard. The blizzard followed heavy rains that fell in Nepal, which also may have been related to the cyclone.

Government administrator Yama Bahadur Chokhyal said rescuers recovered 10 bodies from the Thorong La pass area on Wednesday. The bodies were not yet identified.  Sixty-four foreign trekkers were rescued from the area on Thursday. Two trekkers from Hong Kong and 12 Israelis were airlifted Wednesday to Kathmandu, where they were being treated at a hospital.  A helicopter from the Trekking Agencies\\' Association of Nepal rescuing trapped climbers in Nepal on Oct. 16, 2014.Image:  Facebook/TAANThe survivors said they survived by taking refuge in a small tea shop along the path. \"I was sure I was going to die on the way to the pass because I lost my group, I lost all the people I was with and I could not see anything,\" said Linor Kajan, an injured trekker from Israel, who said she was stuck in waist-deep snow. \"One Nepalese guide who knows the way saw me, and asked me to stay with him. And he dragged me, really dragged me to the tea shop. And everybody there was really frightened,\" Kajan added. Another Israeli survivor, Yakov Megreli, said they tried to stay awake in the tea shop to stay warm. \"We tried not to sleep. We tried not to get hypothermia. It was a very frightening and awful situation,\" he said.  Seven-day precipitation totals, showing the heavy precipitation in the Himalayas.Image:  NASAThe blizzard was partly a product of the cyclone\\'s counter-clockwise circulation, which pushed copious amounts of moisture up against the wall of mountains in Nepal and northern India.  The winds around the cyclone temporarily directed a firehose of moisture from the warm waters of the Indian Ocean north-northwestward toward the Himalayas — some of the world\\'s tallest mountain peaks with elevations above 20,000 feet — at the time when elite mountaineers were trying to reach the summit of mountains such as K2 and Mount Everest. The snowfall, which was measured in feet, not inches, occurred as the mountains were sideswiped by the tail of the dying cyclone. Snowfall totals topped 6 feet in some places, according to multiple reports. The mountains acted like a sponge, squeezing out moisture as it was lifted up and over them, in a process known as orographic lift.  The blizzard, the tail end of a cyclone that hit the Indian coast a few days earlier, appeared to contribute to an avalanche Wednesday that killed at least eight people in Phu village in neighboring Manang district. The dead included one Indian, four Canadian trekkers and three villagers, according to government official Devendra Lamichane. The villagers\\' bodies were recovered Wednesday, he said. The foreigners\\' bodies were buried in up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) of snow, and digging them out will take days, Lamichane said. Three Canadian trekkers who survived the avalanche were taken by helicopter to a shelter in a nearby village. No information was immediately available on their condition. Authorities said five climbers were killed in a separate avalanche about 45 miles to the west, at the base camp for Mount Dhaulagiri. The climbers, two Slovaks and three Nepali guides, were preparing to scale the 26,800-foot peak, the world\\'s seventh tallest, according to Gyanedra Shrestha of Nepal\\'s mountaineering department. Their bodies were recovered Thursday. An avalanche in April just above the base camp on Mount Everest killed 16 Nepalese guides, the deadliest single disaster on the mountain. Some climate scientists say rising global temperatures have contributed to avalanches in the Himalayas. While it is rare for tropical weather systems to produce snowfall, it has been known to happen. In fact, this scenario occurred during Hurricane Sandy in the U.S., when as much as 3 feet of snow fell in the mountains of West Virginia after the storm made landfall in New Jersey.

Zendrive, a driving analytics company, studied the driving habits of more than 1,000 drivers in San Francisco. It found that taxi drivers were 46% more likely to speed than rideshare drivers, and 18% more likely to speed than average drivers. See also: Uber\\'s worst-case scenario: slowing down To perform the study, Zendrive hired passengers to take rides and secretly record the experience. The company\\'s software uses smartphone sensors to measure a car\\'s movement.

Passengers took more than 500 rides from rideshare companies, including Sidecar, Lyft and Uber, about 250 taxi rides, and 250 rides with average drivers. The study shows that taxi drivers were the worst at obeying traffic laws: 60% of the taxi rides taken in the study included a safety violation (such as speeding or phone usage). Additionally, taxi drivers were 70% more likely than rideshare drivers to practice \"unsafe speeding,\" which the company defines as combining speeding with phone usage or hard braking. \"This study was done completely without the knowledge of taxi companies, rideshare companies, or their drivers before, during, or after,\" Zendrive said in a statement. \"We paid passengers to take over 1,000 rides along the same routes, without the drivers knowing that there was anything different from an ordinary ride.\" Uber, Lyft and Sidecar drivers were the least likely to speed: 22% of rideshare cars in the study exceeded the speed limit, compared to 27% of average drivers and 32% of taxi drivers. Non-professional drivers were least likely (18%) to use their phones, with rideshare drivers coming in next (20%), and taxi drivers coming in last (25%). ',\n",

Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, successful entrepreneurs seem to share several traits that the rest of the pack lacks. SCORE, a nonprofit organization aimed at helping small businesses, recently released their infographic on what makes today\\'s entrepreneurs successful. To thrive, entrepreneurs need professional experience, a business plan, the right personality and mentors, SCORE found. Professional Experience Professional experience gives entrepreneurs the edge they need to make wise business decisions. Entrepreneurs with a track record of success are two-and-a-half times more likely to raise more money, 3.6 times more likely to see better user growth, and 52% less likely to scale prematurely, the infographic revealed. A Business Plan Taking the time to write a business plan not only gives your business direction, it also improves your odds. Companies with a business plan see nearly twice the success as those without one, SCORE found. Those companies that create business plans also see higher business growth and are more likely to secure capital and loans.  <divclass-\"see-also\">SEE ALSO: 8 Free Business Plan Templates for Startups \\xa0 Positive Personality Think you can succeed as an entrepreneur just by being you? If you\\'re overly aggressive and unapproachable, think again. The most successful entrepreneurs are beaming with positive traits, such as openness and agreeableness. The least desirable traits include narcissism, making excuses and emotional instability. Also, while being aggressive can often work to your advantage, entrepreneurs need to kick the bad habit of predatory aggressiveness if they want to be successful, SCORE found. A Mentor New businesses shouldn\\'t have to go at it alone. The most successful business owners have relied on some form of mentorship to provide guidance and keep them on the right track. Entrepreneurs who work with mentors are three times more likely to start a business, seven times more likely to raise investment money, and three and a half times more likely to grow demand for their product, the infographic shows.

       " ' The West has been suffering from a severe drought since 2013 and, in some cases, much longer than that. Conditions are particularly acute in California, where close to 60% of the state is experiencing \"exceptional\" drought after three years of below average rainfall. This is the worst category according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  According to a new study published in the journal Science, the regional drought has cost the West about 240 gigatons of surface to near-surface water, or about 63 trillion gallons of water. This is equivalent to covering the entire western U.S. with a four-inch layer of water, the study found.  The study, which used GPS data, found that in response to the lack of surface water, land masses across the West have been rising, especially in California\\'s Sierra Nevada Mountain range. In other words, the drought is actually moving mountains.

Vince Vaughn, who according to many reports is up for one of four leading roles. See also: 13 Devastating Emmy Snubs Mashable has confirmed that no official negotiations have taken place yet, but Deadline reports that Vaughn\\'s up for a villainous role in Season 2, possibly playing a man with \"mob ties.\" TVLine first reported Vaughn could possibly join the Season 2 cast, which is still officially unset. It\\'s been close to 3 months since Hollywood first began clamoring for casting news about the sophomore season of the HBO hit, with names like Jessica Chastain among those rumored — and later denied — by multiple parties. Most recently, Colin Farrell and Taylor Kitsch were said to be in serious talks.  In June, HBO\\'s President of Programming Michael Lombardo said the network was circling some big names to take lead roles, and, at the time, had read two scripts that were \"more exciting than the first season.\" True Detective Season 1 is currently up for 12 Emmy nominations, including outstanding lead actor in a drama series (for Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey) and outstanding drama series.  If anything, this buzz about Season 2 is worth the network dragging on for a bit longer, as who wouldn\\'t want a little excited speculation to keep the show\\'s name on people\\'s lips as ballots are cast?

       " ' Thom Yorke really might be a paranoid android.  The musician released a solo album, Tomorrow\\'s Modern Boxes, online for $6 on Friday. The twist? It\\'s currently only available on BitTorrent. It\\'s a bit of an unconventional choice, but is in tune with the Radiohead frontman\\'s past methods. In 2007, the band released seventh album In Rainbows online, allowing fans to pay whatever they wanted. The band\\'s follow-up, 2011\\'s The King of Limbs, was put out online a day earlier than planned. See also: Surprise! 12 Musicians Who Ignore Traditional Publicity This new pairing for Yorke\\'s sophomore solo effort with BitTorrent has spawned numerous reactions, from peeved to perplexed to positively pleased.  Dear Thom Yorke: What the heck is Bit Torrent and can I listen to it on my iTunes? — Brisblondie (@Brisblondie) September 26, 2014   A bit torrent bundle is so out of the way.. what is this 2001? — THE RULER (@RUCKAZOID) September 26, 2014   Glad to hear Thom Yorke has released his new album via BitTorrent. P2P is exactly what the internet is all about! — Bob (@wharsmetoothpic) September 26, 2014  Yorke isn\\'t the first artist to release something in a BitTorrent bundle, but he\\'s the first to put his album behind a paygate. Since the process is fairly novel, there\\'s even a guide to unlocking the album on BitTorrent\\'s blog.  \"It\\'s an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around,\" Yorke wrote of the project. However, based on the reaction of some of the fans, the general public is still a bit confused. First, they need to have a better understanding of BitTorrent.  So, what is BitTorrent? BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that allows users to share files over the Internet. You can \"download files quickly by allowing people downloading the file to upload (distribute) parts of it at the same time,\" according to its own site.  BitTorrent allows people to \"seed\" files — that is, download files and host them. Instead of downloading your file from a single source, you can \"leech\" pieces of it from multiple seeding sources, which is what makes BitTorrent so much faster than other services.  It\\'s ideal for sharing large files, and has popularly become a hub for illegally sharing music, movies and more. Outside of the entertainment world, BitTorrent is also used by companies like Facebook to engineer new updates.  It was first available in 2001, and has since risen to more than 150 million active users. Peer-to-peer file sharing is extremely popular, though it has seen a decline in recent years because of \"real-time entertainment.\" Streaming services like Netflix have made it easy for fans to get an entertainment fix without downloading whole files. However, that doesn\\'t mean peer-to-peer file sharing will disappear. It also hasn\\'t stopped BitTorrent from being more invested in the entertainment realm.  BitTorrent Bundles In 2013, the company introduced BitTorrent Bundles. To put it simply, it\\'s essentially a download that includes files like songs and music videos.   Artists such as Madonna, Moby and De La Soul have also released artistic projects through Bundles. It\\'s an interesting model, because it puts the available files behind a gate — if you want the bundle, you have to exchange your email address, or some other bit of personal information.  The platform gives artists a certain control over their work. Now, with the paygate, artists will also reap strong financial benefits. They receive 90% of the proceeds, and BitTorrent pockets the remaining 10%. How to download files There\\'s a helpful guide available on BitTorrent\\'s site, but let\\'s walk through the main points. First, you\\'ll need a torrent file, which you can get from a torrent site. From there, you have to import it into BitTorrent (which you can download here).  Here\\'s how to import, according to BitTorrent\\'s site:   Click File > Add Torrent in BitTorrent (or press CTRL+O) and locate the torrent file. Double-click the torrent file. Note: This only works if you\\'ve associated .torrent files with BitTorrent — BitTorrent asks you if it should do this the first time you run it. If you clicked \"No,\" you can do this by going to Options > Preferences in BitTorrent, then clicking \"Associate with .torrent files\" under \"Windows Integration.\" Advanced: Click File > Add Torrent from URL in BitTorrent (or press CTRL+U), and enter a URL from which the .torrent file can be obtained.  From there, you can search for your desired file on torrent services (here\\'s a list of legal ones compiled by the folks at GigaOM).  To specifically get Yorke\\'s new album, BitTorrent has another handy step-by-step guide. First, you have to head to the album\\'s Bundle page and click \"Buy the Album.\" You\\'ll be prompted to pay for it, either with a credit card or PayPal. Then you can start the download. In order to download Bundles, you must have the BitTorrent client. If you don\\'t have it, you\\'ll be prompted to download the bundle and the client by clicking on the option \"I need the BitTorrent client.\" Heads up: The album can only be downloaded twice. After your download is finished, you can open the files directly or drag them to your media player, like iTunes, Spotify or Windows Media Player. Then you can embrace your inner Yorke and dance frenetically around your room.    Thom Yorke, the king of limbs.

It will bring support for low-end devices (such as those with 512MB of RAM and 16GB of storage), as well as better support for non-touch devices. The new version of the platform will also support phones with Snapdragon 200 and 400 chipsets, as well as dual SIM devices, paving way for low- and mid-range device makers.

       " ' The unicorn is a legendary beast — associated with all things magical, beautiful and happy. The mythical rarity of this symbol of royalty has evolved over the years. It can be anything from a equine-like beauty to a term meaning someone special (i.e., “Bro, that girl is definitely my unicorn”).  We recognize the unicorn by its flawless white coat, long, spiraled horn and shimmering eyes. Scientifically, however, a unicorn is any animal with only one horn. By that account, there have been unicorn goats, cows and deer who grew their horn either by way of genetic mutation or by transplanting the horn buds to the center of the head. And let\\'s not forget the unicorn\\'s illegitimate child, the narwhale. See also: 10 Unicorn Accessories to Sparkle Up Your Office Commonly found in artwork at the forefront of a rainbow or battling a lion, the majestic unicorn exists in many places, spanning both Western and Eastern history. Here, we take a look at some of the most prominent unicorns in pop culture.   The Unofficial History of Unicorns        1. 400 BC: Ctesias and other historical writers  One of the earliest mentions of a unicorn was in the 5th century by Greek physician and historian Ctesias. He wrote about white, powerful creatures with red heads, dark blue eyes and singular, multi-colored, foot-and-a-half-long horns.  Unicorn experts (Double-thinking your \"cool job\" yet?) like Odell Shepard believe that Ctesias heard secondhand from Indian travelers, perhaps unwittingly describing rhinoceroses.  Other prominent historical figures who have been connected to or written about unicorns include Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar.           2. 1495 to 1505: The Unicorn Tapestries  These unicorn tapestries are thought to be some of the most recognized legitimate unicorn art, and certainly some of the most beautiful tapestries to date.  Painstakingly handwoven in the Southern Netherlands from silk, wool and metallic threads, the seven hangings are known as “The Hunt of the Unicorn” or “The Unicorn Tapestries.” Each is about 12 feet tall. A monogram of the letters “A” and “E” is woven into the corners, but no one knows for certain what they stand for. The La Rouchfoucald family of France owned the unicorn tapestries for a number of centuries. In 1923, John D. Rockefeller  purchased them for more than a million dollars. He eventually donated the tapestries to the Cloisters branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Its value is inestimable.  \"The Lady and the Unicorn\" is a very similar series of six tapestries, woven in Flanders, and considered one of the greatest surviving works of the Middle Ages.    Image: Web Gallery of Art, via Wikimedia Commons         3. 1577: Queen Elizabeth I of England’s “Horn of Windsor”  The Queen of England evidently wanted in on the sparkly unicorn obsession.  The explorer Martin Frobisher acquired the horn in northern Canada and gave it to the Queen when he returned from his journey. It came to be known as the “Horn of Windsor,” likely for the royal residence Windsor Castle. Alleged unicorn horns during this time period were worth their weight many times over in gold and valued for their healing properties.  But years later, it was deduced that the unicorn horn is actually from a narwhal ... or is it?   Image: George Gower, via Wikimedia Commons         4. 1611: King James’ Unicorns  The King James version of the Bible uses the word “unicorn” nine times. The term is used by Balaam, Moses, David, Isaiah and even God in the book of Job.  The original Hebrew word is “re’em,” which the actual translation is still a subject of debate among scholars today. None of the other modern versions of the Bible use the term, many replacing it with “ox.”    Image: Anaconda74, via Wikimedia Commons         5. 1979 to 1990s: Lisa Frank’s unicorns  A tribute to unicorns would not be complete without the modern purveyor of fantastical creatures: Lisa Frank. The company was founded in 1979, and has since become a global franchise of colorful stationary and merchandise. Markie the Unicorn was one of  Lisa Frank’s classic characters, resplendent in all its rainbow glory. The original Lisa Frank characters continued to be favored throughout the spike in popularity during the \\'90s.   Image: @zefbug on Instagram         6. 1982: The Last Unicorn   Although it premiered more than 30 years ago, The Last Unicorn is perhaps the most prominent unicorn movie yet produced. The 84-minute animated film is Peter S. Beagle\\'s adaptation of his 1968 novel and is voiced by an A-list cast including Mia Farrow, Jeff Bridges, Alan Arkin, Christopher Lee and Angela Lansbury. The storyline follows a beautiful white unicorn who searches for the rest of her breed, fearing she is, indeed, the last of the unicorns. Adventure ensues.  Upon its release, Variety praised the children\\'s film for the voice talent, claiming that it significantly outshined the animation. Other unicorn films include Unico and Nico the Unicorn.   Image: Tumblr glamboyl         7. 1990: Invisible Pink Unicorn  Similar to the Flying Spaghetti Monster, the IPU is a parody religion popular with atheists and religious skeptics. The unicorn is a paradoxical goddess, both invisible and pink.  The IPU\\'s earliest documented reference was around 1990 in a Usenet atheist group discussion, then gained traction in 1994 from a digital bulletin board system at the University of Iowa.   Image:  CC-BY-2.5, via Wikimedia Commons         8. 1994: Beanie Babies’ Mystic the Unicorn  “Once upon a time so far awayA unicorn was born one day in MayKeep Mystic with you, she’s a prizeYou’ll see the magic in her blue eyes!” Mystic the Unicorn was part of the Beanie Babies fad during the \\'90s — the first generation came out in 1994. There are six retired and three current iterations of Mystic, with varying degrees of iridescence and sparkle.    Image: eBay whittle4u1         9.  1996: Rapidash the Pokémon  One of the ‘90s fondest childhood unicorns, albeit a minor one, Rapidash first appeared in Pokémon Red and Blue, the first U.S. game versions of the Japan-imported craze. Rapidash is one of the original 150 pokémon and the evolved form of Ponyta.  Fire runs down the back of this fire-type pokémon to form a mane and tail, burning anyone it doesn’t trust. It’s highly competitive and gallops at nearly 150 miles per hour.    Image: Tumblr growlithes         9. 2006: “Charlie the Unicorn”  Like unicorns, YouTube videos don\\'t have to make sense in order to develop a viral following.  The four-minute cartoon documents the short-lived adventure of a lethargic unicorn, Charlie, as he journeys to Candy Mountain with Pink and Blue, two high-pitched, cloying unicorns.  Independent animator Jason Steele of production company FilmCow originally created the video in 2005 as a flash animation test — his mother likes unicorns. It was uploaded onto YouTube in 2006 by Geoff Swanson, where it rapidly gained attention. Two years later, FilmCow uploaded the same version, and together, the video has more than 83 million views.    Video: YouTube, FilmCow         10. 2010: Robot Unicorn Attack   Unicorns show up from time to time in games — consider Borderlands 2’s Butt Stallion. But the first unicorn to be a bona fide star in its own hit game hails from Adult Swim’s Robot Unicorn Attack. Somehow, we’ve gotten to a point where 20 to 30-year-old males are the target market for game with unicorns and sparkles. Progress?  The mega-popular side-scrolling online game was produced by Spiritonin Media and features the 1994 synthpop ballad “Always” by Erasure. It was later released on iOS and Android.  Sequels and parallels include Robot Unicorn Attack 2, Robot Unicorn Attack: Evolution, Robot Unicorn Attack Christmas Edition, Robot Unicorn Attack Heavy Metal and Retro Unicorn Attack.  There’s also a parody game featuring Nyancat — Nyanicorn.   Image: Tumblr p1nkbb         11. 1980 to Present Day: My Little Pony  Though the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic brand has widely taken over since it launched in 2010, each generation of kids since the \\'80s have their own version of the MLP. Unicorns are one of the types of ponies in the MLP universe — others include Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies and alicorns (unicorns that eventually sprout wings). The first generation of MLP\\'s unicorns were Moondancer, Sunbeam, Twilight and Glory, who is arguably the inspiration behind Rarity, the fourth-generation unicorn pony from Friendship Is Magic.   Image: Tumblr my-little-rarity         12. 2014: Real Unicorn Sightings   Following the viral popularity of regular horse masks in 2010, a white, dainty unicorn mask became available for purchase. The masks spawned an Internet meme, featuring photos of people in the masks performing everyday tasks. But the real takeaway is that  we\\'re now closer than ever to actually being able to turn into unicorns.   Image: Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press      ',\n",

       " ' When Nike laid off big chunks of its FuelBand team on Friday, the future of fitness trackers was suddenly in question. Nike, after all, has one of the most active fitness communities in Nike+, and its FuelBand hardware received generally good reviews. Why run for the exit now? However, Nike isn\\'t leaving behind wearables per se; it\\'s just not going to make any new hardware. The company said it will continue to support existing FuelBands, and its team will work to adapt the software for more platforms. Given Nike\\'s close ties to Apple, this only fuels speculation about an upcoming release of the long-rumored Apple wearable — the iWatch. See also: Nike+ Fuelband SE Is a Fitness Tracker That Gets Involved Such a strategic shift makes sense on a high level, but it\\'s extremely odd when you look at the numbers. Fitness trackers are a growing market — Canalys estimates 17 million \"smart bands\" will ship in 2014, and the market will increase to 45 million by 2017. Nike\\'s share is 14% of the worldwide market (Fitbit, one of the earliest players, is the leader at 58%). Nike could have kept the FuelBand and still pushed forward with plans to bring the software to more devices, but it didn\\'t. That\\'s because the numbers don\\'t reveal two realities Nike was facing: Building standout hardware takes extreme dedication, and making that hardware stand out is about to get exceedingly difficult. Hardware: not for the faint of heart The first point is obvious to anyone in the hardware business, but it bears re-examination. Building hardware is a very difficult thing to get right, and even if you do, there are a host of potential problems that could still get in the way, most of which are beyond your control: supplier issues, shifting partner strategies, leaks, changing consumer tastes... the list goes on. \"[Hardware] requires deep expertise in things that are unique to the consumer electronics world,\" says Jef Holove, CEO of Basis, which was recently acquired by Intel. \"It also requires a certain fortitude. Certainly Nike\\'s move is a reminder that doing this category is difficult.\" Nike is an athletics wear company first, and everything else second. While it\\'s been dabbling in gadgets for more than a decade, building technology products simply isn\\'t its core business. It\\'s easy to see how, after forecasting what sort of dedication would be required to take the FuelBand to the next level, it decided to kill it and instead focus on its community via software and let the gadget builders (mainly Apple) do what they do best. It would be wrongheaded to dismiss Nike\\'s FuelBand exit as an isolated case of an uncommitted hardware maker with cozy ties to a major tech company. As great a picture as Canalys paints about fitness wearables, they\\'re facing competition on two fronts: both from smartwatches and from smartphones. In the iPhone 5S, Apple introduced the M7 motion coprocessor, and single \"hub\" that manages the information from the device\\'s many sensors. Other manufacturers, including HTC and Samsung, have similar technology, and Samsung goes one step further by providing an app called S Health into which developers can link. (Apple is rumored to be doing the same thing with iOS 8.) We\\'ve already seen some migration from fitness tracker to phone. Fitbit\\'s iPhone app now talks directly with the M7 chip to track the user\\'s motion, essentially \"Fitbit without the Fitbit.\" S Health will count your steps — one of the primary reasons for wearing a tracker. As smartphone sensors get more sophisticated, there\\'s a danger that many users might decide that the phone itself provides enough information, and a tracker is redundant. \"I think the pure app makers would like to think where everyone is just using their smartphone, but from what we\\'ve seen they prefer wearables primarily for the 24/7 aspect,\" says James Park, CEO of Fitbit. \"Most people, especially women, don\\'t have their smartphone on them all the time.\" The smartwatch squeeze As Park alludes to, no one would wear a smartphone to bed, so for now trackers are the only option for around-the-clock health tracking. Dedicated trackers will soon face competition there from another wearable, however, namely smartwatches. Although both devices reside on the wrist, smartwatches provide a more rounded experience, bringing apps, notifications and phone calls to a wearable — in addition to fitness tracking. While smartwatches, in their current form, aren\\'t exactly ready for nighttime wear either, the Samsung Gear Fit is pointing the way to a sleeker future. That device is already compact, and its flexible display (housed in a rigid gadget) opens up lots of possibilities. Within a couple of years, it may be possible to buy a smartwatch that\\'s not much bigger than those bands they put on people\\'s wrists in hospitals. \"Simple devices are going to get consumed by smartwatches and phones,\" agrees Holove. \"Wearables are going to have to discover what makes it essential to wear the technology, and what insight can we drive based on the fact that it\\'s wearable that you can\\'t just get from the phone in your pocket.\" In the same way tablets pushed e-readers into becoming a smaller, commoditized market, smartwatches could relegate fitness trackers into becoming a cheap, specialized option for those who want passive tracking with no frills. After all, why get something that just tracks your steps, sleep and heart rate, when you can get all that plus texting, weather alerts and Tetris, too? That would put ownership of the wrist-wearables game into the hands of Apple, Samsung and other major tech companies, since it\\'d be hard for specialized gadget makers like Jawbone or Withings to deliver a seamless smartwatch experience. The approach seems more consumer-friendly, too, since it negates the \"different band for every app\" concern. Why should I need to decide whether I\\'m a Nike or Fitbit person? An iWatch would theoretically let me be both. \"I\\'m very skeptical that there\\'s a one-size-fits-all approach to the market,\" says Park. \"While the category might not be as varied as watches, I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be like the smartphone category where there\\'s two, maybe three dominant form factors. I think there\\'s going to be a wide variety of approaches.\" What Park is getting at is the fashion factor. If the excitement surrounding the Moto 360 is any indication, smartwatches may become more about the image the person wants to project than the practical benefits of 24/7 tracking. Fitness bands are already something of a fashion statement. \"Those devices say something about the user that a smartwatch doesn\\'t,\" says Holove. \"These devices are icons, they\\'re almost symbols that say the person wearing it cares about their health. I think that\\'s important.\" Image could be the category\\'s strongest asset, but it likely won\\'t be enough to sustain all the disparate devices and their communities. Nike may have been the first to realize that the space between smartphones and smartwatches is about to get uncomfortably tight, but it certainly won\\'t be the last. ',\n",
       " ' Are you not entertained, America?  As announcer Chris Berman amply displayed during his commentary on Monday Night Football this week, widespread allegations of domestic abuse and love of the game can be awkward to juggle when you\\'re an NFL fan. Now, despite a bruising week of controversy for the country\\'s most popular sports league, it seems viewers are far from giving up on the game.   See also: If Ray Rice never plays again, please don\\'t credit ethics CBS and NFL Networks\\' season-opening broadcast of Thursday Night Football featured the Baltimore Ravens, the team that fired domestic violence poster boy Ray Rice this week, beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-6.  The broadcast more than doubled the audience for its corresponding game last season and was the highest-rated Thursday primetime program for CBS since 2006.  The game drew an overnight household rating of 13.7, outpacing the game in its same slot last season by a whopping 108%. (Last year\\'s game was only carried on the cable station NFL Network, while this year\\'s game was on both NFL Network and CBS.) Thursday night\\'s game was CBS\\' most-viewed Thursday primetime delivery since May 18, 2006. CBS is paying the NFL $275 million to broadcast eight Thursday Night Football games this season.  Controversy over how the NFL handled its investigation of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée in a casino elevator last February erupted on Monday after TMZ leaked a security video showing the punch itself for the first time. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made his first extended public comments about the video in an interview with CBS on Wednesday morning, something many observers criticized as a softball approach to the whole scandal.  According to The Hollywood Reporter, this week\\'s smashing debut for CBS\\' new Thursday Night Football schedule drew a rating just 10% lower than NBC\\'s Sunday Night Football broadcast that aired the day before the Rice controversy reached a new level of scandal.  Rice, of course, did not play Thursday night\\'s game. Goodell originally suspended him for two games, announcing the ban in July. After that was roundly criticized as a light punishment, Goodell announced a sweeping new domestic violence policy covering not just players but all NFL employees: A six-game ban for first-time domestic violence offenses, and a lifetime ban for second offenses.  Then, after the TMZ video leaked, Goodell promptly suspended Rice, a first-time domestic violence offender previously lauded as a model citizen, from the NFL indefinitely. The Ravens terminated his $35 million contract.  But just because Rice is unemployed, that did not mean that NFL fans on Thursday night were deprived from watching a Baltimore Raven with a track record of hitting women. In fact, they were watching someone whose alleged exploits were never caught on video but make Rice\\'s domestic violence achievements seem positively amateurish.  Pro Bowl linebacker Terrell Suggs registered three tackles and one quarterback hit (on Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers, who himself has twice been accused of sexual assault) on Thursday night.  In 2012 Candace Williams, Suggs\\' longtime girlfriend and mother of his two children, filed a protective order against him in which she alleged that he punched her in the neck and drove a car containing their kids at a \"high rate of speed\" while dragging her alongside the vehicle, according to The Baltimore Sun.  A month after filing the order, Williams had it removed and she and Suggs got married; they\\'re still together today. When Suggs was ordered to give up any firearms in his possession after Williams filed her protective order, he turned over no less than seven guns. But that\\'s not all. Williams also accused Suggs of disturbing instances of domestic violence on at least two occasions before 2012. From the Sun: In a previous incident involving the pair, Williams alleged that on December 2009 Suggs, \"held me down on the floor and poured bleach on me and our son, held me down on the floor and kicked my face and broke my nose. Throughout our relationship since early 2007, he has punched me in the face and stomach and threatened to take the children from me if I left him. He stole my ID so I could not leave.\" When Suggs was introduced before Thursday night\\'s game in Baltimore, he entered the field wearing a gladiator helmet as flames erupted behind him — as shown in the photo atop this post and the Vine below.   “I just thought that we needed a boost,” Suggs said of the helmet. “I couldn’t afford to start slow. I just wanted to get the crowd and my team in there early.” ',\n",

       " ' Starting July 21, airline passengers will be paying more fees for security at the airport. Following orders from Congress, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is poised to raise the security screening fee to $5.60 each way. This fee, which is included in your ticket price, is up from $2.50 each way for a nonstop flight and $5 for a trip including connections. See also: Know Before You Go: All the Airline Fees by Carrier Trips with long stopovers — more than four hours on most domestic travel — will have bigger increases because each leg will trigger a new fee. The fee is used to finance \"the increased cost of securing the nation\\'s transportation systems,\" according to the TSA. In 2013, the security fee on passengers raised more than $1.8 billion for the TSA, or about 20% of its $8 billion annual budget. The increase would bring in enough money to cover 43% of 2014\\'s budget, according to the U.S. House Budget Committee. Congress approved higher TSA fees as part of a December budget deal. Despite protests against the TSA\\'s proposal, Congress dictated that the security fee rise to $5.60. A spokeswoman for industry trade group Airlines for America says the changes will hurt people in smaller cities who must take more one-way flights to get where they\\'re going. The additional fees would be on top of the already higher price of airfares to and from smaller cities. Fares are often higher because of the combination of fewer available carriers and less demand. The proposed changes will be published Friday in the Federal Register and take effect 30 days later. There is a 60-day public comment period, but it would likely take another act of Congress to change TSA\\'s rules. Additional reporting by The Associated Press ',\n",
       " \" Octopuses grow quickly, have lots of tasty flesh and are found all over the world. As the world's supply of fish diminishes while the number of humans keeps increasing, it seems these creatures would make an ideal mass-produced food for our hungry mouths. So where are all the octopus farms? The main thing that prevents octopus farming at large scale is that the common octopus - Octopus vulgaris - is tough to feed in captivity, especially when first born. After hatching, octopuses first exist as tiny organisms known as paralarvae, drifting around the upper ocean in among clouds of plankton which they feed on. It is this stage - before they become fully fledged young adults and descend further into the sea - which is hardest to replicate in aquaculture. Feeding octopuses adequately during their first two months of life is a challenge. In this period, octopuses have highly selective feeding habits, and acceptable survival rates are hard to achieve. At an industrial scale, the only possible solution is to take wild juveniles caught at sea and grow them in floating sea cages. Fishermen start with individuals of about 800 grams and grow them until they are more than 2-3kg, supplying them with crustaceans and low value fish over a period of three or four months. Fishermen cooperatives in north-western Spain grow octopus in sea-cages. They sell them at high season - Christmas and summer - where large creatures can reach €10-12 per kilo, double the usual price. So far, research has allowed small-scale production by artisanal producers in Vigo, Galicia, reaching a production of just ten metric tons per year. But this system is highly dependent on the success of the initial catches; without a good crop of smaller octopuses to grow in the cages, end results will always be limited. This is why farmed-raised octopus hasn't had commercial success yet. Over the past 15 years the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) in Vigo has carried out important and successful research to overcome the problems with octopus cultivation, and the institute is now focused on rearing octopus across a full life cycle - from hatch to catch. In fact they managed to complete full cultivation across the life cycle of several octopuses for the first time ever in 2001. This experiment was achieved after using live crustacean larvae known as zoeae as prey along with the commonly used artemia, a brine shrimp. However, it is very difficult to obtain these zoeae in large quantities, making large-scale production prohibitively expensive. So researchers are now focusing on analyzing the biochemical composition of the larvae to find out what makes them tick - and what makes octopuses find them so tasty (or at least edible). Once identified, the idea is to ensure the cultured enriched artemia has the same features. But once the octopus is up to a certain size, there is another step to be solved: the transition between paralarvae and juvenile. This stage is another mortality peak in octopus farms. Working with other species that don't have a paralarvae phase would help, such as the Mexican Four-Eyed Octopus - known scientifically as Octopus maya. Like cuttlefish, these octopuses hatch ready for the deep seas, with all the same features as their adult selves. There is still a transition phase of sorts though, when they still need commercial feed pellets to grow adequately. Octopus maya cultivation represents the most advanced attempts at commercially sound cephalopod aquaculture. But even with this species, it has been necessary to rely on targeting a specialized gourmet-level market. In conclusion, the best octopus farms cannot yet compete directly with the common wild-captured product. Developments in feeding products and techniques over the next few years will be key. Once small octopuses can be fed in large numbers, the development of a full undersea farming industry will be much easier.

Whether it\\'s launching human remains into space or finding new ways to get rid of all those pesky human corpses, these businesses have a unique take on life\\'s final journey. Here are seven businesses that cater to the uncommon needs of the dead: Murder scene maids You\\'ve heard there\\'s no use crying over spilled milk, but what\\'s the consensus on spilled blood? If the idea of mopping up gore makes your eyes water (or worse), don\\'t worry: There\\'s a business you can call to tidy up even the bloodiest of messes. Baxter Restoration, a cleaning and reconstruction company in Orlando, Fla., does something your average maid won\\'t: It cleans up after the Grim Reaper. Whether it\\'s a crime scene, the aftermath of a suicide or the remains of an exploded meth lab, Baxter will disinfect, decontaminate and leave things looking less macabre. Industry insiders refer to such sluicing down of blood and brains as \"biohazard\" cleanup. And while this unusual service makes some people squirm, it\\'s reassuring to know that there\\'s someone you can call to perform this most unpleasant of chores. Afterlife app Leaving behind a hefty inheritance for family members to squabble over is a nice gesture. But what if you want to bequeath something more meaningful than money? There\\'s an app for that. Your Last Will is an iPhone app developed by former video game publisher and entrepreneur, Wolfgang Gabler. The app lets users prepare for the hereafter by recording a short video with a final message for those they\\'ll one day leave behind. Have some words of wisdom for your children? Want to specify that your big sister is still not allowed to borrow your favorite sweater? Whatever your final words, the app lets you record them in a five-minute video, which is then uploaded to the company\\'s servers. Your Last Will then generates a QR code for you to share with a trusted confidant who can sign into your account after your demise and distribute your video to friends, family, archenemies, old flings and whomever else you choose to haunt. You can even make your will public and inspire (or sadden) the entire Internet.

Invented and patented by Robert Barrows, the president of an advertising and public relations firm in California, the \"video-enhanced grave marker\" is a tombstone for the modern age. Embedded with a remote-controlled video screen, this high-tech memorial caters to those unwilling to go quietly into the hereafter.  As Barrows explains on his website, the invention allows people to record messages for family, friends and even complete strangers before dying. Once the person is six feet under, these messages are broadcast right in the cemetery. Mourners can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show! Barrows envisions a future in which graveyard visitors will pay a fee (headset included) to wander from grave to grave, listening to the dark secrets and final advice of lost love ones, as well as dead strangers. Compostable coffins Sure, you eat organic apples and have sworn off plastic shopping bags, but will your green lifestyle die when you do? That\\'s the question this next business wants you to consider before it\\'s too late. The Natural Burial Company is an online retail and consulting business that sells biodegradable coffins, caskets, urns and other funeral goodies for eco-conscious mortals. The business aims to facilitate the natural burial process for those who take the whole \"dust to dust\" thing literally. To that end, the company sells goods such as the \"Everybody\" Coffin Kit, a biodegradable cork coffin that you can put together in your living room. Talk about a fun do-it-yourself project! The company\\'s online retail store also features a line of products for pets, including a biodegradable urn in the shape of a yarn ball for the eco-minded (but aging) feline in your life.  Carbon-free cremation If you want to be cremated but aren\\'t sold on the idea of being hoisted onto a conveyor belt and pushed into a giant oven, then this next business is for you. Anderson McQueen Funeral Home in St. Petersburg, Fla., specializes in a new kind of cremation that utilizes water, not fire, to dispose of human bodies. The process is known as alkali hydrolysis, or \"flameless cremation,\" and while it sounds less scary than its fiery cousin, the end result is much the same. In this process, the body is soaked in a tub of water and alkali for a few hours. Resulting in 75 percent lower carbon emissions than traditional cremation, flameless cremation is marketed to those looking for a greener way to go. This eco-friendly process is still in the early adoption phase and is only legal in a few states. But legislation is pending in many states that could bring this bizarre alternative into the mainstream. Aquatic afterlife Lots of people want their ashes scattered across the surface of the sea, but those looking for a unique postmortem experience may want to consider permanently joining the seafloor instead. Based in Decatur, Ga., Eternal Reefs specializes in the construction of \"memorial reefs.\" The company mixes human remains into concrete, artificial reefs. The reefs are then lowered to the seafloor, where they play host to local sea life and help maintain marine diversity. The company\\'s \"reef balls\" are expertly designed to withstand even the strongest of ocean currents, so mourners don\\'t have to worry that a loved one\\'s remains will drift into unchartered waters. Each reef also features a bronze plaque bearing the name of the deceased person it\\'s made from, making this memorial much like an underwater tombstone. Spacey sendoff If the deep blue sea isn\\'t your thing, you might want to consider sending your remains into deep space instead. Celestis, a company offering \"memorial spaceflight services,\" launches human remains into the dark corners of the universe. Celestis\\' Voyager Service, scheduled to launch for the first time in 2015, isn\\'t exactly the cheapest way to memorialize a loved one, but it might be the strangest. For $12,500, the company will strap 1 gram of the departed\\'s remains onto a spacecraft and launch it into outer space. Or, if you\\'d like to know just where your loved one is headed, you can opt for the company\\'s Luna Service, which rockets human remains directly to the surface of the moon. For those with smaller budgets, Celestis\\' Earth Rise Service (starting at $995) launches remains into outer space for just a few minutes. After floating in zero gravity, your loved one will drift back down to Earth, where you\\'ll be reunited with their space-traveling remains.  Extroverted?

The Arizona Supreme Court also delayed the execution Wednesday morning to consider a last-minute appeal about whether Wood received inadequate legal representation at his sentencing. But about an hour later, the state\\'s high court allowed the execution to proceed. Wood argued he has a First Amendment right to details about the state\\'s method for lethal injections, the qualifications of the executioner and who makes the drugs. Such demands for greater transparency have become a new legal tactic in death penalty cases. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had put the execution on hold, saying the state must reveal the information. But the Supreme Court has not been receptive to the tactic, ruling against death penalty lawyers on the argument each time it has been before justices.

On the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for Dietz\\'s father, who disapproved of his daughter\\'s relationship with Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father hung up, Wood pulled out a revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled. Wood then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to telephone for help. Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood say, \"I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.\" He then called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest.

       " ' If your ideal vacation involves more relaxation time than thoughts of death and decay, then perhaps these creep-tastic destinations aren\\'t for you. However, if you have an inhuman tolerance for the heebie-jeebies, there are some hair-raising, fear-inspiring hotspots of the macabre from all over the world.   See also: 9 Absolutely Petrifying Places on the Internet For those of you whose bucket lists contain both, \"visit all seven continents\" and \"host a Tim Burton marathon in my mother\\'s basement,\" then pack your bags, liquidate your assets and get on a plane immediately.  Your first stop is probably on this list.   The World\\'s Creepiest Places        1. The Catacombs of Paris, France  After blowing your money on escargot, baguettes, crepes and tiny replicas of the Eiffel Tower, no trip to Paris is complete without a trip to the Parisian Catacombs -- that is, unless you prefer not being surrounded by thousands of dead bodies, meticulously disassembled and stacked in neat little piles.   Perhaps the creepiest thing about this place is the fact that someone was responsible for digging up graves, taking apart skeletons, and sorting them into those stacks.             2. The Radioactive Amusement Park, Chernobyl  If you dislike clowns, weathered toys or Eastern Europe, the Prypiat Amusement Park is definitely in your no-fly zone.   After the Chernobyl disaster, a catastrophic nuclear event in 1986, everyone within a 19-mile radius was evacuated and forced to leave everything behind. The highest concentration of creepy juju is in the theme park, which still seems to be waiting for the kids to come back and play on its tetanus-ridden bumper cars. Despite the creepitude, there is still a minor tourism industry in Kiev based around short tours into the radioactive wasteland.  Check your scaredy pants at the door.   Image: Flickr, Timm Suess         3. The Cave of the Crystal Grave, Belize  If you were just bold enough to enter those Parisian Catacombs, test your nerves at the Actun Tunichil Muknal.   This very old cave is purportedly the site of an ancient human sacrifice. Its most famous inhabitant is the Crystal Maiden, who may or may not have been the victim of the aforementioned human sacrifice.  She now rests, covered in tiny, glittering crystals, and  fused to the floor of the cave. You\\'ll never look at your little cousin\\'s rhinestones the same way again.   Image: Peter Andersen         4. The Island of the Dolls, Mexico  As the story goes, a man named Don Julian Santana\\'s day was ruined about five decades ago, when he discovered the body of a little girl washed up on the shore of his island.  He promptly went  completely insane and spent the rest of his life hanging washed up dolls in the trees in order to appease the restless spirit of the girl.  Hence the name, \"La Isla de las Munecas.\" Unsurprisingly, this story doesn\\'t have a happy ending.  In 2001, Santana was found drowned in the river he had obsessed over for 50 years.  His family now runs the site as a tourist attraction.   Image: Flickr, Esparta Palma         5. The Human Library, Sicily  The Catacombe dei Cappuccini were originally intended as a place for friars to mummify and store themselves until the Second Coming, but soon became the trendy burial site for local elite.   Now, dressed in their finest death garbs, these mummies are on display in individual shelves throughout the ossuary.  Like books. This creepy gesture was a sign of status; only the wealthy could afford display space for their embalmed bodies.   Image: Sibeaster         6. The Mutter Museum, Philadelphia   Humans are fascinated by weird things, but sometimes obsession goes a little too far.   Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter spent his medical career dealing with the weirdest of the weird in diseases and deformities.  After he died, his collection was released and expanded for the public to view. Walk into the Mutter Museum today and you are surrounded by a bloated ovary the size of a soccer ball, a wall of deformed heads and a two-headed baby preserved in formaldehyde, among other oddities.   Image: Flickr, Alex Lau         7. The Ghost City, China  According to Chinese mythology, the pure of heart go to Heaven when they die, but the evil go to Diyu, the concept of hell. The Ghost City of Fengdu is modeled after that realm.  The city boasts scores of graves and shrines, evil-looking statues and a bridge that supposedly ejects evil people into the water when they try to cross, kind of like on Wipeout. Fengdu is also rumored to be the prime chill-out spot for the King of Hell, and attracts tourists in fanny packs from all over the world.   Image: Gisling         8. The Cursed Resort, Taiwan  Stacks of rusting, saucer-shaped pods blemish an otherwise pleasant-looking field, in San Zhi, Taiwan.   These pods have been abandoned since their construction in the late \\'70s -- not because they look like an architect had just discovered \\'60s drug culture, but instead because the land is supposedly cursed. In the 17th century, locals laid siege to the site\\'s previous occupant, Fort Zeelandia, in an uprising against oppressive Dutch settlers, massacring hundreds of men, women and children. The area has since seen countless strange accidents, car crashes and deaths.  On top of that, construction workers chopped a remaining lucky dragon statue in half right to make way for the resort.  The Taiwanese government to this day refuses to talk about San Zhi.   Image: Flickr, Carrie Kellenberger         9. The Painted Skulls of Hallstatt, Austria  In a tiny building behind the Hallstatt Catholic Church, there are 1200 human skulls. In what has been called a \"charming\" ceremony, 10 to 15-year-old Hallstattian corpses are dug up, sun-bleached, and decorated, arts \\'n crafts style, with images important to their family members. Nothing says \"vacay\" like being in a room with 2400 graffitied eye sockets staring at you.    Image: Infrogmation         10. The Lome Fetish Market, Togo  The African nation of Togo is only known for a few things: its tropical weather, its fascinating woodcarvings and its crazy underground voodoo bazaar.   The bazaar is chock-full of dead cats, dogs, monkeys ... pretty much dead everything. These items can be used for anything from voodoo to home decor, depending on whether or not your drapes go well with the musky scent of death.   Image: Flickr, Julius Cruickshank         11. The Mummy Museum, Mexico  In the 1800s, a cholera outbreak in Guanajuato, Mexico killed hundreds of people. As a result, overcrowded cemeteries became such a problem that the government levied an ongoing tax against the families of those occupying local graves. Relatives left with the tax either thought this was unacceptable or just didn\\'t have the income to pay, so their relatives were dug up and embalmed.   While this practice was discontinued in 1958, a museum full of these corpses remains. Tourists can witness dozens of cholera victims at a time for just 52 pesos a pop.   Image: Flickr, Russ Bowling         12. The Suicide Forest, Japan  Those who live near Aokigahara Suicide Forest say there are three types of people that visit: sightseers who just want to check out the Fuji mountainside, the morbidly curious, and the people who are not expected to ever return. These woods are the second most popular place of suicide in the world, following the Golden Gate Bridge. Between 10 and 80 people end their lives in the \"Sea of Trees\" each year.  Anti-suicide signs are scattered throughout the area proclaiming things like, \"Your life is a precious gift from your parents,\" or \"Please consult the police before you decide to die!\"   Image: Flickr, mtzn         13. The Bone Church, Czech Republic Like many other locations on this list, the citizens of Sedlec, Czech Republic ran into the issue of having more dead bodies than they knew what to do with.  While the French stacked them into piles and the Austrians painted them, the Czech priests decided to use the bones for decor. In 1870 they brought in a master woodcarver named  Frantisek Rint to put the bones in order. As a result of his work, the church is now covered -- from steps to steeple -- in bone art.  More than 40,000 skeletons are arranged into designs, including a cross, the Schwarzenberg coat of arms and an amazing, giant chandelier composed of at least one of each type of human bone.

Knowles dropped the song \"Bow Down/I Been On\" Sunday, along with  a picture of her as a child wearing a floor-length, taffeta pink dress complete with tiara (obviously, the singer has always been a trendsetter).   The song was produced by Hit Boy — who also produced her hubby Jay Z\\'s \"Ni**as in Paris\" — and is aggressive, to say the least.

       " ' ANKARA, Turkey — Dozens of Turkish hostages seized by the Islamic State group in Iraq were freed Saturday, resolving a serious crisis which Turkish officials had long cited as a reason to avoid moving aggressively against the violent militant group. The 49 hostages were captured from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq, on June 11, when ISIS overran the city in its surge to seize large swaths of Iraq and Syria. But the circumstances of their release — which drew flag-waving crowds to the Turkish capital\\'s airport — were clouded in mystery. See also: ISIS Continues Propaganda Campaign With 55-Minute \\'Flames of War\\' Video Turkish leaders gave only limited details of the release, and hostages declined to answer all but the most general questions from journalists when they arrived at Ankara\\'s Esenboga International Airport around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, local time. Turkey\\'s state-run Anadolu Agency reported that no ransom had been paid, and \"no conditions were accepted in return for their release,\" but the organization didn\\'t cite any source for its reporting. \"I think it\\'s fair to say that we haven\\'t been told the full story,\" said Aaron Stein, an associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, who has studied Turkey\\'s security policy. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the release was the result of the intelligence agency\\'s \"own methods,\" and not a special-forces operations, but did not elaborate. \"After intense efforts that lasted days and weeks, in the early hours, our citizens were handed over to us, and we brought them back to our country,\" Davutoglu said. “They came to Turkey at 5 a.m. in the morning. We followed the developments closely all night”, he told reporters in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, where he was visiting, according to Anadolu. Families broke through security lines, and rushed toward the plane to greet loved ones, as they descended the stairs of Davutoglu\\'s plane, whose arrival at Ankara\\'s airport was broadcast live on Turkish television. The joyous scene at the airport contrasts with the recent beheadings of two U.S. journalists and a British aid worker by ISIS.  The freed Turkish hostages are welcomed at the airport in Ankara, Turkey, on Saturday, Sept. 20, 2014. Image: Associated Press/Associated PressHostages quizzed by journalists as they emerged from the plane said they couldn\\'t go into detail surrounding the nature of their ordeal, but several hinted at ill treatment and death threats. Ex-hostage Alptekin Esirgun told Anadolu that militants held a gun to Consul General Ozturk Yilmaz\\'s head, and tried to force him to make a statement. Another, Alparslan Yel, said ISIS \"treated us a little better because we are Muslims. But we weren\\'t that comfortable. There was a war going on.\" Turkey had been reluctant to join a coalition to defeat ISIS, citing the safety of its 49 kidnapped citizens, but Stein said he doubted Turkey would suddenly adopt a much more muscular attitude toward the organization. Turkey might feel freer to advertise its existing efforts against the group, he said, citing its efforts to control oil smuggling across the border. But Stein said Turkey would not open its air bases to U.S. aircraft operating against the group. \"There will some changes, but not as much as people hope.\" Meanwhile, the successful operation will likely be a boon to Turkey\\'s government. During an impassioned speech following his flight\\'s arrival in Ankara, Davutoglu, flanked by Yilmaz and others, highlighted Turkey\\'s success and blasted the political opposition. Davutoglu thanked the \"nameless heroes\" who were involved in the release. Yilmaz, the freed consul general, thanked Turkish officials involved in his release, but did not give details about the hostages\\' captivity or how they were freed. He refused to take more questions, saying: \"I haven\\'t seen my family for 102 days. All I want to do is to go home with them.\" It wasn\\'t clear where the release took place, but the Anadolu Agency said the hostages had been held in eight separate addresses in Mosul. Their whereabouts were monitored by drones and other means, it said. Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Turks were freed through \"a successful operation.\" \"I thank the prime minister and his colleagues for this operation which was pre-planned, whose every detail was calculated, which lasted through the night in total secrecy and ended successfully this morning,\" Erdogan said in a statement. The president will reportedly meet the rescued hostages in Ankara on Sunday. Iraqi military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said the government had no information about the release of the hostages, and didn\\'t know where they had been held or where they were released. Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers who were also seized in Mosul on June 6 were released a month later. Turkey did not provide information surrounding their release.

       " ' The third version of Flipboard rolled out on Thursday, and it\\'s the most personal and magazine-like experience the platform has offered yet, particularly for phones. Flipboard is a media-aggregating app that started on tablets around the time the first iPad was introduced, though it later expanded to iPhones, then Android and finally web browsers. Flipboard provides a personalized platform (based on what interests you) to its users, aggregating news articles, social media content and more into a \"flippable\" magazine-style format. See also: Facebook\\'s Paper vs. Flipboard: Comparing Mobile News Apps Flipboard 3.0 is, in some sense, shifting away from its tablet focus and fully embracing the smartphone as a way to engage with content. The design interface for smartphones has been refurbished with a new quick-access tab bar to navigate the app, simplified story collection and updated cover designs. Flipboard said that 70% of its users are now on smartphones. One of the biggest new features is the \"topics\" picker, which lets you go a bit deeper on Flipboard into what interests you. There are more than 34,000 searchable topics on the app, according to Flipboard, which range from broad categories like photography to niche topics, such as zoology. Previously, categories were more broad and limited. The topics picker is a way to add some specificity to your Flipboard experience.  In March, Flipboard acquired Zite, the developer behind topics. An additional new feature, despite the company\\'s proclamations, is actually less personal: The Daily Edition is a roundup of headlines \"you need to know\" that\\'s directly curated by Flipboard editors. While it veers from Flipboard\\'s \"you are a special snowflake\" appeal, it could be easy way to keep up with important news, and it\\'s ready every morning at 7 a.m. You can now follow people or magazines on Flipboard, and the app will make suggestions for who you should follow. People who curate magazines on Flipboard should also be excited about a new analytics tool that will give you insight into how people are responding to your content.   ',\n",
       " \" All 15 crew members involved in navigating the South Korean ferry are in custody, according to a prosecutor investigating the ship's sinking, which has left 187 dead and 115 missing so far. Prosecutor Yang Jung-jin, a member of the joint-investigation team, said four crew members were detained on Saturday, according to multiple reports. Eleven other members, including the Sewol's captain Lee Joon-seok, were previously arrested on negligence charges.  See also: South Korea Confirms It Sent Wrong Bodies to Families of Ferry Victims Despite mounting public outrage against the crew — South Korean President Park Geun-hye compared the actions of the captain and some crew to murder — several survivors of the disaster have recalled acts of heroism by some. At least seven of the ferry's 29 crew members are dead or missing, while some of those who survived remained on or near the ship to assist passengers, according to the Associated Press.  More than 300 people are dead or missing after the Sewol capsized off the southern coast of South Korea last week. Of the 476 people on board, there were more than 330 students and teachers from Danwon High School in Ansan, a city near Seoul. Only 174 people have been rescued. Search-and-rescue teams have been retrieving bodies from the water, and officials are in the process of identifying victims. On Friday, officials pulled 48 bodies from a single room of the ferry that was only meant to accommodate 38 people.   The South Korean government reportedly admitted that it sent the wrong bodies to victims' families. Officials later announced a plan to ensure no more bodies would be misidentified, which involves identifying victims through DNA testing, dental records or fingerprinting.  U.S. President Barack Obama offered his condolences to South Korea after landing in the country on Friday. \",\n",
       " ' It\\'s 2020 and you\\'re 13 years old. There is very little delineation between real life and the Internet. Your face computer ensures that an IM, text, photo or video is only a blink away. Your friends are nearly always accessible and you can hang out virtually just as easily as you can IRL. You have no need to engage in a public forum, except on your terms. Social networking is baked into your everyday experience the way the web was synonymous with computers and mobile devices back in 2013. Where does Facebook fit in in this scenario? It\\'s still hugely popular and influential — with your parents. In other words, Facebook has become Yahoo. Snicker if you must. Yahoo these days is that \\'90s throwback Marissa Mayer is desperately trying to resurrect. At one time, though, Yahoo was as dominant on the web as Facebook is today. Fifteen years ago, Yahoo was the No. 1 destination on the web with 40 million monthly visitors. That may sound like pocket change compared to Facebook\\'s 1.1 billion, but consider that there were only 140 million people on the web at the time. See also: I\\'m 13 and None of My Friends Use Facebook True, Yahoo at its peak wasn\\'t as dominant as Facebook is today. Back in 1998, about one-third of web users visited Yahoo. Today, with a global audience of 2.4 billion, Facebook has about half. That said, from a raw numbers standpoint, Yahoo is still no slouch. About 700 million people each month visit Yahoo\\'s sites, and in the U.S. at least, Yahoo gets more visitors than Facebook.  So why is Facebook still considered a much hotter company than Yahoo? Demographics. Facebook overindexes on users under 18 and especially on 18- to 24-year-olds, according to Quantcast. Yahoo underindexes on those below 18 and only slightly overindexes on 18- to 24-year-olds.  Can Facebook maintain that dominance in the youth market? It\\'s certainly possible. As Rob Callender, director of youth insights for The Futures Company, a Chicago-based researcher notes, Apple and Nike have managed to be cool with teens year after year.  That said, Callender\\'s latest research shows that teen use of Facebook has plateaued. Despite reports to the contrary, though, they aren\\'t abandoning the platform in droves. \"It\\'s been a decline that isn\\'t significant,\" he says. Part of the issue is the oft-cited phenomenon of kids being spooked by elder family members suddenly friending them. \"Once people found out that aunts and grandfathers followed them, their enthusiasm went up in a puff of smoke,\" Callender says. (Seeing a 50-year-old with an iPhone apparently doesn\\'t have the same effect.) Ruby Karp, a 13-year old, explained the problem in a recent piece about Facebook on Mashable: \"All of our parents and parents\\' friends have Facebooks. It’s not just the fact that I occasionally get wall posts like, \\'Hello sweetie pie!\\' But my friends post photos that get me in trouble with those parents.\" Luckily for Facebook, there\\'s no social media behemoth there to take its place. Instead, teens are being siphoned away by Snapchat and messaging apps. Given teens\\' penchant for privacy, these closed-loop networks represent a potent threat to Facebook, which is taking steps to become a more public platform.  The wild card in this mix is Google Glass. If such wearable computing becomes popular and within a few years filters down to teens, it could drastically change the way they consume media. Facebook has shown it can adapt to mobile, but bringing that experience to something like Google Glass will be a challenge on top of a challenge. Just as with mobile, Facebook\\'s aesthetic advantage will be lost; on Glass it will be just another app. Here, Facebook\\'s key selling point — its huge user base — will work against it as teens seek more intimate experiences. In such a doomsday scenario, Facebook won\\'t disappear. Like Yahoo, it will stick around along with its huge, aging user base. Still making money, but with its glory days behind it, Facebook will once again prove the maxim that demographics is destiny.  Image: Mashable ',\n",

       " ' A Dutch student has taken the bold decision to sell all his data at auction. It\\'s a decision that should make us think about the future of our own information. In an auction on April 12, Shawn Buckles sold his complete \"data soul\" — his location records, his medical records, his personal calendar, the content of his emails and all the information from his social media communications. He sold his online conversations, his consumer preferences and his Internet browsing history. The lot. And for his soul he received €350. Like Buckles, we all generate vast amounts of data on a daily basis and it is used by various companies for various purposes, such as to tailor online advertising. People don\\'t generally understand the value of their data, which is partly what Buckles was commenting on when he sold his. It might seem that exchanging your personal data for benefits will not feature in the near future but Buckle\\'s auction shows us that a scenario in which we commercialize our personal information is not necessarily that distant. As yet there is no market on which an individual can sell their personal data. While it is already to some extent clear what companies such as Google, Facebook and Tesco can get out of it, it is unknown how much a data soul is worth nor how one might use all the pieces of data that one person produces as a single package. Perhaps luckily for Buckles, his auction is unlikely to provide any answers. The winning bidder was technology news company The Next Web, which Buckles says will use his data to highlight the issue of online privacy rather than to a more sinister end. The sale is also probably not an accurate measure of the true market value of a person\\'s data soul. It is plausible that in the future the value of personal data will be determined through an emergent market that can leverage it effectively. There is demand from the health research sector, entertainment industries and insurance companies, to name but a few. If a more established market was operating to serve this demand, we could probably expect to get out of the data what it is actually worth. That said, it is also possible that a market could emerge that would see us exchanging our data for something other than money. Insurance companies might reduce insurance premiums based on lifestyle data collected through life-logging. Information from apps that monitor your sleep, activity or exercise could work for both you and the company. In fact, this type of exchange is already happening in car insurance, where premiums depend on your driving record. Benefit doesn\\'t have to imply direct monetary value to the person, either. We might in the future decide to use our data as a philanthropic resource. Instead of or as well as giving a monthly donation to our favorite charity, we might donate our data. A disease research charity could benefit from your health records, for example. Buckle\\'s auction also raises important ethical questions, of course. At what point do digital records of human behavior stop being personal? Obviously the content of Buckle\\'s inbox is personal but is a calculation of the average number of emails per day per country personal? Is GPS data averaged across millions of people personal? The first ever data soul auction has certainly raised more questions than answers. Buckles is in a sense ahead of the pack. We are all growing increasingly aware that our personal data is valuable but while we continue to struggle to define what we are willing to accept in exchange for its use, companies are already basing their business models on the contents of our Internet history. Would you accept €350 for your digital soul? You may have to decide on your price sooner than you think.

       " \" The search for the missing passengers on the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol stalled Saturday due to bad weather and the degradation of the ship's internal partitions, according to a report. Divers are finding it difficult to enter different parts of the Sewol, as the partitions have become waterlogged, and started to bend, government task force spokesperson Ko Myung-Seok told the Associated Press. Bad weather also prevented divers from conducting underwater searches on Saturday, Ko said.  See also: Civilian Diver Involved in Search for South Korean Ferry Victims Dies As of Saturday, the death toll reached 275, the AP reported. Only 174 people have been rescued so far, including 22 of the 29 crew members, with 29 still missing. The final death toll is expected to be around 300. Of the 476 people on board, there were more than 330 students and teachers from Danwon High School in Ansan, a city near Seoul. The Sewol capsized off the southern coast of South Korea on April 16. Floating debris and difficulty navigating the ferry's corridors and cabins previously hindered search efforts; however, search teams took advantage of better weather and calmer ocean currents earlier this week. A civilian diver involved in the search efforts died Tuesday, after becoming unconscious while conducting an underwater search. The Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, and 14 other crew members were arrested on negligence charges, and for abandoning passengers aboard the ferry during an emergency. Four others who were not aboard the Sewol when it sank, including those suspected of negligence in their handling of the ferry's cargo, were also arrested on Tuesday. The head of the company that owns the Sewol, Chonghaejin Marine Co. Ltd.'s Kim Han-sik, was formally arrested Friday, after investigators suspected that improper stowage and excess cargo may have contributed to the sinking, the AP reported.  The ferry reportedly exceeded its cargo limit for over a year leading up to its final trip, and could have been more overloaded than ever on the day it sank, according to documents revealing regulatory failures. \",\n",

       " ' Lawmakers in Washington are trying for a third time to create new immigration visas for foreign-born entrepreneurs who want to start a business and for highly-trained workers who want to research or work in the United States.  The Startup Act 3.0, introduced Wednesday, would create those new types of visas as well as eliminate per-country caps on employment-based visas.  To qualify for the entrepreneur\\'s visa, foreign-born entrepreneurs would have to start a business that employs at least two full-time employees and invests or raises investments of up to $100,000 in the first year of their time in the United States. They would then be given another three years to grow to a staff of at least five, after which they can apply to remove a conditional status on their visa. To qualify for the STEM visa, foreign students would have to first graduate from an American university with Master\\'s or PhD in science, technology, engineering or mathematics on a student visa. STEM visa holders would become permanent legal residents after five years of remaining engaged in STEM-related fields. \"Engaged\" is a bit vague, but potentially includes definitions as wide as teaching a class — so a person with a Master\\'s degree pursuing a PhD could qualify if they were teaching a course. The Startup Act 3.0 also carries provisions intended to help bolster the startup economy, including a permanent exemption on capital gains taxes on the sale of startup stock held for at least five years and the creation of a research and development tax credit for small startups, among other benefits. SEE ALSO: Obama: \\'Instagram Was Started With the Help of an Immigrant\\'  The bill, introduced by Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), is the authors\\' most recent attempt at high-skilled and entrepreneurial immigration reform. The Startup Act 2.0 was introduced last year and gained some support but stalled before being called to a vote. \"America has long been seen as the land of opportunity for innovators and entrepreneurs. We must do everything possible to make certain that remains true,\" said Sen. Moran in an e-mailed statement.  \"At a time when our economy needs jobs first and foremost, America’s archaic government policies have us falling behind,\" he continued. \"We are losing talent and jobs by the day to countries like Canada, Chile, and the United Kingdom that are aggressively courting the world’s best and brightest. We must pass Startup Act 3.0, or we risk losing the next generation of great entrepreneurs and the jobs they create to countries that have taken action to attract and better support these innovators.\" AOL founder-cum-venture capitalist Steve Case spoke well of the Startup Act 3.0 in testimony to Congress regarding immigration reform on Wednesday. \"Numerous bipartisan, high-skilled immigration proposals have been teed up in recent months that contain smart reforms aimed at righting this policy,\" said Case. \"A combination of these reforms should make up a core component of a comprehensive immigration package. The Startup Act permits entrepreneurs and STEM graduates to stay and set up businesses.\" Do you support an \"entrepreneur\\'s visa?\" What about a \"STEM visa?\" Share your thoughts in the comments.

Police responded with tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets. On many nights, dozens were arrested. St. Louis County police initially handled security, but criticism of their tactics prompted Nixon to put Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge.

Organizers of Yates\\' group and other protesters gathered Tuesday for training that includes how to take notes and shoot video of police actions on the streets. \"There is a significant effort to make sure that people\\'s rights are protected and that there\\'s no violence on either side,\" said Andy Stepanian, a spokesman for several protest groups.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Since the arrival of Ebola on United States\\' shores, a couple of things have become abundantly clear: No matter how often health officials say that the disease is not transmitted through casual contact — it\\'s easier to get a cold — plenty of Americans are witch-hunt-level paranoid about catching it. And too many folks have no clue about the geography of Africa or how big the continent is. Combine those two things, and we get the sad situation that a teacher in Blackwell, Oklahoma finds herself in. The educator, who teaches at Blackwell Elementary School, has an upcoming mission trip to Rwanda. The teacher, whose identity hasn\\'t been revealed, is off to do good deeds. But after fearful parents in the 7,000-person town launched a petition expressing concern over the teacher\\'s possible exposure to Ebola, the educator agreed to quarantine herself for 21 days after she returns. SEE ALSO: Taking fruit bats off the dinner menu will help stop Ebola  Rwanda is in East Africa and is 3,000 miles away from the nations on the western side of the continent — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia — that are dealing with Ebola outbreaks. Rwanda has never had a case of the disease. But some parents in Blackwell don\\'t seem to care about those facts. \"This just concerns me, they would want to take the risk of allowing the teacher to go over there and then come back and come in not knowing if she is infected [or] not and put other kids at risk,\" Reba Newton, one of nearly 400 parents who signed the petition, told KWTV. \"If they weren\\'t going to do anything we were just going to pull them out for 21 days,\" added petition signer Shawn Wilson, whose three children attend Blackwell Elementary. SEE ALSO: Did Deforestation Cause Ebola?  To alleviate any concerns, the teacher decided to self-quarantine instead. \"I told her we would put her on administrative leave at that time even though we don\\'t think there\\'s any possible danger she\\'s going to contract it where she\\'s going or anything like that,\" school district\\'s superintendent Rick Riggs told KWTV. \"Just solve the parent\\'s fears.\"Apparently, however, those parents aren\\'t afraid of people coming to town from Dallas — just 304 miles away — where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan died in October. Not to give Blackwell, Oklahoma residents any more bad ideas, but they\\'re also not demanding a quarantine on folks who might be traveling from New York City, where current Ebola patient Dr. Craig Spencer lives. SEE ALSO: Uh-Oh, America\\'s top health official is comparing Ebola to AIDS   Education officials caving to parents\\' irrational fears isn\\'t isolated to Blackwell. The virus is only transmitted through direct contact with an infected person\\'s blood, vomit, or other bodily fluids, but that didn\\'t stop a Connecticut school district from barring a third grader who returned on Oct. 13 from Nigeria — which was declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization on Oct. 20 after six weeks with no new cases — from attending classes at Meadowside Elementary in Milford, Connecticut. The girl\\'s family is now suing the school district. According to the suit, the local superintendent agreed to send a tutor to the girl\\'s home so she could keep up with her studies, reported WTNH. However, if the family sent the child to class at the school, the superintendent \"would order her to be removed from the school by the police.\" The superintendent in Blackwell, Oklahoma seems to be thinking about the legal ramifications of the district\\'s decision. \"We will be reviewing our policies and if necessary making appropriate changes in consultation with the district\\'s legal counsel,\" he wrote in a statement. In the meantime, it sure sounds like it wouldn\\'t be a bad idea to offer parents in the community a class on Ebola transmission, and maybe a few geography lessons are in order too.

       " ' The iconic Empire State Building in New York City changes the color of its lights at the top of the building to celebrate certain occasions. As far as we know, it’s never celebrated Doctor Who — and fans of the show want that to change. Someone has started a Change.org petition to get the building lit up TARDIS blue on Nov. 23. Fans of the show will recognize the date as the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, which first premiered Nov. 23, 1963. The 50th-anniversary special for the show will air this Nov. 23 in a simultaneous broadcast in 70 countries. The petition is aimed at the company that owns the Empire State Building, and it already has 30,917 signatures, with a goal of 35,000. The petitioners have filed the official application with the company for the lighting, but they think a petition would be a good show of support. Couldn’t hurt. In their explanation, the petitioners say they don’t believe the Empire State Building has ever been lit to celebrate a science fiction show. It was lit green in 2009 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but we can’t think of any other examples off hand. We happen to be in New York, so if the petitioners get their way and the building is lit up like the TARDIS, we’ll do our best to get some photos for you on the day. We know the Empire State Building can be lit in a variety of colors, but what we want to know is if the light at the top can slowly pulse while loudspeakers play that whooshing noise?

       " \" Kyle Seager of the Seattle Mariners swung at a pitch and lost control of his bat during an MLB game in Houston last month. The lumber flew into the stands and hit a young Houston fan named Lyle. Lyle wasn't hurt — but that's not the only silver lining of the situation. Lyle also proved himself to be a young class act by sending Seager a delightfully sweet handwritten letter exonerating the big leaguer of any guilt.  See also: Top 10 Summer Swimming Pool Dunk Videos Seager's wife, Julie, recently posted the letter to her Twitter account, sharing the major dose of cuteness with the rest of the world.  If you're having trouble reading Lyle's handwriting, here's a transcription:  Dear Mr. Seager, My name is Lyle Raymond. Your bat landed on me. I am OK. Thanks for giving me the thumbs up when you were on first base. I like the Astros but will cheer you on too. I gave back your bat because you had a big hitting streak with that bat. I hope you have more with that bat. Your fan,  Lyle  The sports world's hordes of rude fans (and even some athletes) may want to follow young Lyle's kind lead.  Image: Greg Fiume/Getty Images \",\n",

       " ' SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Friday it has detained an American tourist for committing an unspecified crime, the third U.S. citizen being held there. The Korean Central News Agency said authorities were investigating him for committing acts inconsistent with the purpose of a tourist visit. It did not give details. \"American citizen Jeffrey Edward Fowle entered the DPRK as a tourist on April 29 and acted in violation of the DPRK law, contrary to the purpose of tourism during his stay,\" KCNA reported, referring to the country\\'s official name, the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea. The U.S. State Department, which last month warned Americans against traveling with private tour operators to North Korea, said it was aware of the reported detainment but did not confirm it. \"There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. We have no additional information to share at this time,\" said a department official who was not able to be quoted by name because of department policy. Two other Americans are being held in North Korea. A 24-year-old man was detained in April for alleged improper behavior while entering the country. The tourist agency he traveled with identified him as Matthew Miller. North Korea said he entered the country on April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum. The brief report said he chose the North \"as a shelter.\" North Korea also has been holding a Korean-American missionary, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012. Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North says were hostile acts against the state. North Korea has been pushing to promote tourism as part of efforts to earn badly needed foreign currency, but the country is also extremely sensitive about how visitors act while in the country. Friday\\'s announcement came as tension on the Korean Peninsula remains high with North Korea keeping up rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea following its series of missile and rocket launches earlier this year. The North\\'s state media have also unleashed racist and sexist slurs against U.S. and South Korean leaders. The peninsula is still in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. The U.S. and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations, but Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, oversees consular issues for the United States there. Unless a detainee signs a privacy waiver, the State Department cannot give details about the case. In March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized for anti-state religious acts and requested forgiveness. In December, North Korea released 85-year-old American veteran of the Korean War, Merrill Newman, who was held for several weeks after traveling to North Korea as a tourist. Newman was freed after he gave a videotaped confession in which he apologized for killing North Koreans during the war. Newman later said the confession was given involuntarily and under duress.

       " \" Job seekers, listen up! Your interview doesn't begin when an employer calls you. It doesn't begin when you walk into an office. And it certainly doesn't begin after you've done all the talking.  It likely begins before you even know it, through a simple online search to check out your presence. Essentially, you’re being “interviewed” online through your social networks — before the background check, before the phone call and before you have any sort of conversation with a potential employer.  So, how can you nail this new sort of social job interview? Let’s explore.  What Are Employers Looking For? According to recent studies, 92% of employers are using or planning to use social networking for recruiting. So, with the majority of employers likely conducting a social job interview, it’s a good idea to understand what they are looking for. Some employers want to be sure you are a creative thinker, have initiative and can multitask. Others may expect you to have a bounty of experience listed on your social networks. It just depends on the organization.  Do your research and find out what the employer is looking for. For example, if the job description says you to need at least three years of work experience, make it clear that you match these requirements. This can be done by either listing out your work history or creating a bio that indicates what you’ve done in the past. This helps the employer identify why you’re worthy of a real interview because your experience is clearly listed.  Change How You Present Yourself Online While having the right sort of content on your social networks is important, the way you present yourself online is equally important. For instance, if you just post content online without any sort of formal opinion on the subject, the employer may never know your stances on industry issues. Nor will they see your critical thinking skills or expertise in the field. Similarly, if you never update your LinkedIn page or Twitter stream, a potential manager won’t be able to tell what sort of candidate you are, freeing up room for your competition.  Put some personality into your social networks, particularly if the company has a heavy emphasis on company culture. For example, if the organization is known to hire self-starters with a penchant for creativity, make sure you present yourself in this light (if applicable, of course). Any of your social networks could easily showcase these traits. Just be sure this content is consistent so the employer notices during pre-screening.  What You Need to Nix Posting relevant content and being active is a necessity for your social job interview. But what are some things that are deal breakers? Your old college photos or controversial posts may not fly with some employers, but there are other factors you should think about. For instance, any time you badmouth a previous employer or co-worker, it may reflect poorly on you, not necessarily the situation. In addition, leaning towards one side of an issue when a potential employer is clearly on the other team can also harm your chances.  While you should always be authentic with your online content and with what you post, you should also think about how others will interpret it. If you’ve applied to a position, think about presenting information in a way that will be attractive to the employer.  For example, if there is positive shift in your industry towards a new practice, why not blog about the topic? This not only shows that you’re aware of what’s going on, but that you also have an opinion. Any employer who sees this will understand why you’re an expert in the space, as well as what this expertise can bring to them.  The social job interview may not be something you think about, but it is something you should consider when applying. Understand what the employer is looking for, present yourself online to show your match and clean up your online presence so you’re seen in the right light. When you do so, the social job interview will just be a positive stepping stone to landing the job. What do you think? What are some other ways job seekers can nail the social job interview?

       " ' When Snapchat introduced its Stories feature earlier this month, it was unclear how brands could take advantage of a new platform in which messages, photos and videos hung around for 24 hours. Taco Bell is providing a road map. The brand was quick to jump on Stories as a platform to tell a very simple, brand-appropriate tale. Here\\'s one example: See also: Could Snapchat Become the Next Instagram?  Taco Bell was one of the few brands to adopt Snapchat, a platform that has a reputation for sexting. The fast food chain used Snapchat to introduce its Beefy Crunch Burrito in May, using the app\\'s ephemeral, 10-seconds-and-it\\'s-gone format for the launch. Stories offers new possibilities, said Nick Tran, social media lead for Taco Bell. \"This is something a lot of fans tell us all the time,\" he said. \"They love sharing their stories and trips and adventure. We created a story that modeled that experience of hanging out with a friend.\"  Though Taco Bell appears to be one of the very few brands to embrace Stories so far — a Snapchat rep couldn\\'t think of any others, though GrubHub, the food delivery company, also has been experimenting with it — the New Orleans Saints also launched a Snapchat presence this week using Stories.  Alex Restrepo, the social media manager for the Saints, said he was drawn by Stories.  \"Stories was the main reason we decided to do it,\" he said. \"The fact that posts last more than 10 seconds was huge.\" Restrepo said he plans to use Snapchat Stories to give fans a behind-the-scenes look at the team. Future snaps will include shots of players\\' lockers, images of the traveling and pre-game performances by local bands before home games. Restrepo said that the metrics on Snapchat take some getting used to — you can\\'t measure how many fans you have, for instance. However, the platform\\'s ability to show the number of people who have viewed an individual image is valuable, he said.  For Snapchat, Stories provides perhaps the clearest path to monetization. Eventually, Snapchat could charge brands for the ability to create Stories or — more likely — to promote those Stories beyond a brand\\'s fan base. Before that happens, though, Snapchat will probably have to improve the quality of its videos, which appear very grainy in the current format. (Restrepo said he tried video but was unimpressed with the quality, so will not use it again.) The Snapchat CEO has promised something \"a little less terrible\" in the future. Mashable composite.

       " ' How do you give people the experience of riding in an electric vehicle without actually sitting in a car? That was the challenge designers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec undertook for a project with BMW i, the automaker\\'s electric mobility division.  The Bouroullec brothers devised Quiet Motion, a lounge installation for the 2013 Salone del Mobile furniture design fair. The design started with the Bouroullecs identifying some key attributes of the BMW i vehicles, namely their lightweight construction, use of environmentally friendly materials and the quiet driving experience.  These were all translated into the design of four seating pods. Each is constructed with essentially the same materials used in the forthcoming BMW i vehicles like the i8. Their structures are made with lightweight carbon fiber, surfaces are wrapped in sustainable BMW i fabrics and the platforms are covered with cork, a renewable material.  Each of the seating pods incorporates electric motors allowing the platforms and canopies to rotate giving visitors the experience of motion. \"We have created a poetic abstraction of modern nomadism by bringing motion into harmony with its surroundings and rendering visible the kind of view you could get through a car window,\" says Erwan Bouroullec.

       " ' When you think economic opportunity, do you think of a heavily regulated, highly-competitive consumer goods sector where prices are set to drop? No? Maybe we should dial back the excitement around the potential of the U.S. marijuana industry. With the legalization of recreational marijuana in the American states of Colorado and Washington last year, along with growing support for legalization among the public and in 18 states, there\\'s a sense that it may be time for businesses and investors to enter a market dominated by criminal and semi-legal operations. (Not for the first time, however: recreational drug sales were common in the 19th and early 20th century). The potential for a legal marijuana market has manifested itself in dot-com comparisons. A Microsoft employee turned pot entrepreneur is \"the Bill Gates of Weed,\" while a Colorado businessman mused aloud, \"do I want to be the next Google or Facebook of marijuana?\" These comparisons are premature. Consider the former Microsoft employee, Jamen Shively, who wants to create an international marijuana brand named after his hemp-growing great-grandfather, Diego Pellicer, by acquiring legally operating dispensaries in Washington and Colorado, and opening more in California. His ambitions are to do for pot what Starbucks did for coffee, all while importing marijuana to the U.S. from Mexico. Shively aims to seize 40% of the $142 billion worldwide market — once he raises a cool $10 million from investors. Credit his boldness. Every industry going from grey markets to white ones needs firms committed to succeeding within the law, and newly opened markets could be the opportunity for someone to make a fortune. It just might be Shively, but it will be very hard for Diego Pellicer to succeed. The biggest problem with this plan is that the U.S. federal government still prohibits the sale and use of marijuana. Where states have allowed medical use, a grey market has evolved with federal law enforcement officials tolerating small operations but cracking down on large operations and efforts to regulate them. There\\'s no suggestion yet that it will be any different in Colorado or Washington. Shively could consolidate a network of dispensaries in those two states, but he\\'ll really have no recourse if the Drug Enforcement Administration decides to shut down his operation and seize all of his assets. And since the main criteria the DEA has for those seizures is size and national ambition, it\\'s hard to imagine he won\\'t attract its attention. Still, there\\'s a sense that opinions on the issue are changing. And what if five years from now — a generous timeline — the national government sees the benefits of legalization and re-classifies marijuana as a controlled substance like tobacco or alcohol, not heroin and cocaine? Won\\'t the pot entrepreneurs of today be in a great position to make millions on legalization? There are still some obstacles. One is that the price of marijuana will likely drop precipitously if it is truly legalized, which will be a boon for consumers but not the producers. While Shively is emphasizing quality, creating a luxury brand that can charge premium prices isn\\'t easy. Another obstacle is that this isn\\'t an industry ripe for disruption: Distributing a plant-based drug is something that existing pharmacies, among other companies, have down to a science. If the regulatory environment really opens up for the private sector, the competition is going to be fierce. You can imagine an analogous ecosystem to the microbreweries that exist precariously next to the near-monopoly imposed by global beer makers, but it could be hard for even the largest pre-existing dispensary chains to beat global corporations if they get involved. The final problem, however, is that legalization for marijuana might not look like legalization for tobacco or alcohol. Mark Kleiman, the public policy professor who is helping create Washington\\'s marijuana regulations, notes that we still don\\'t know enough about how legal pot will work to understand what legalization really means for people and businesses. As the experiment there and in Colorado continues, lawmakers may decide that marijuana should be more strictly controlled than other recreational drugs, or not for recreational use at all. That won\\'t mean an end to marijuana\\'s (legal) profit potential, but it does imply the road ahead for pot entrepreneurs isn\\'t likely to be easy.

       " \"     Train tracks are a dangerous place, people. If you drop something on the tracks — like your cellphone — remind yourself it just isn't worth it. The latest video showing a death-defying attempt at rescuing a cellphone shows a young woman in Sao Paulo, Brazil being frantically pulled back to the platform as a train is coming into the station. You can see how close it was in the video above.  The woman apparently dropped her phone onto the tracks and like so many people before her, jumped onto the tracks to retrieve it. In the video notice the man who helped pull her to safety is a trained security guard. She was lucky. There have been numerous stories before where people struggled to help someone back up. Of course, others stop to record the entire episode on their phones as well. This morning on a crowded train platform in New Jersey I actually witnessed someone watch in horror as something spilled out of her bag onto the tracks. You could see for a fleeting moment she looked up in the direction the train comes from to see if she had time to retrieve it. She looked back down. It seemed like she might really jump down to go after it. Luckily, the people around her warned her not to and a station official was called. Numerous studies show many of us have become addicted to our mobile devices — with 60% of those responding to one survey saying they usually can't go longer than an hour without checking their phone. Sure, you can squeeze out 30 extra seconds of email or texting while you wait for the train, but if the unthinkable happens, and it's going to happen, is it really worth risking your life?  What would you do if your cellphone fell onto the tracks? Does the video scare you? Let us know in the comments.  Image courtesy Flickr, mikecogh \",\n",
       " ' In the frenzy to determine who — and what — shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a group of citizen journalists armed with simple intuition and an Internet connection has been collecting information more nimbly than American spies. On Tuesday, U.S. intelligence officials admitted that while it\\'s true that Russia has been arming pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine for months, no proof exists that the Buk SA-11 surface-to-air missile launcher, which Washington says took down the plane, was Russian. (However, a Ukrainian rebel leader confirmed that pro-Russian separatists had the Buk missiles.) See also: The Nightmare Ukraine Has Been Living for Months \"We don\\'t know a name, we don\\'t know a rank and we\\'re not even 100% sure of a nationality,\" one official said during a press briefing. \"There is not going to be a Perry Mason moment here.\" (A Perry Mason moment refers to a dramatic introduction of evidence, previously unknown to most, that seemingly changes the outcome of an investigation or legal proceeding.) But a group of citizen journalists led by Eliot Higgins, who is better know by his online alias \"Brown Moses,\" has had plenty of Perry Mason moments in the last few days.   Higgins, with the help of some of his Twitter followers, was able to pinpoint the location of a Buk launcher while it was being transported through Snizhne, a pro-Russian rebel-held town in Ukraine near the Russian border, based on a video circulating on YouTube.   Refined #MH17 crash location 12km from the Snizhne Buk based on this tweet from @henkvaness https://t.co/zFae6Gdv4r pic.twitter.com/iiy8vsKPpV — Brown Moses (@Brown_Moses) July 17, 2014  The next day, Aric Toler, a longtime follower of Higgins, identified the exact location of a photograph of the Buk launcher in Torez, another town in Eastern Ukraine, using only open source information like the name of a store shown in the picture, and other unrelated YouTube videos filmed in the area.   Good work by @AricToler who has geolocated this photo to Torez, not Snizhne as widely claimed. pic.twitter.com/sAFoktXkRq — Brown Moses (@Brown_Moses) July 18, 2014  Toler and Higgins were able to establish that the photograph was shot around 11:40 a.m. local time, using an online tool called Suncalc, which lets you calculate the position of the sun based of the time of day and location. That would prove that the launcher was in the area before the MH17 crash. (Higgins told Mashable that he checked the tool\\'s accuracy by taking pictures of his garden at different times of the day to see if the shadows matched the ones on the site.) Another crowdsourced analysis that Higgins assembled on Tuesday offers strong proof that a video published by the Ukrainian government shows the Buk launcher being moved from Ukraine to Russia through rebel-held towns. In the video, the launcher seems to be missing a missile.  The Russian government rebuffed the video, claiming it had actually been filmed in the town of Krasnoarmeisk, which under the control of the Ukrainian military. However, thanks to other open source intelligence analysis, it turns out the town is not actually Krasnoarmeisk but the rebel-held Luhansk, just 30 miles from the Russian border. \"The Russians lied,\" Higgins wrote in his post on Bellingcat, his new website to promote the work of other investigative citizen journalists and to teach others about the tools they use. The site is currently raising money on Kickstarter. These findings certainly don\\'t prove that Russia was responsible for the downing of MH17, as Higgins himself admits, but rather provide strong evidence that pro-Russian rebels possess (or possessed, until very recently) a Buk missile launcher, and that it was close to the crash site before and after the plane was shot down.  \"It\\'s interesting that this launcher took a trip through rebel-held territory to the launch site and then up toward the rebel-held city toward the border with Russia,\" Higgins said. For Higgins, this work is simple intelligence-gathering, which can help those on the ground investigate further. After he and Toler established the location and time of the picture of the Buk in Torez, journalists traveled to the spot and found witnesses that confirmed the analysis, Higgins said.  That would suggest Higgins and the dozen or so people who have helped him over the past few days know just as much as professional American spies. “[The Americans] clearly only rely on open source information, or mostly on open source, yet they are not releasing what they\\'re relying on,\" Higgins said. \"It\\'s like they\\'re ashamed.\" These investigations are a good example of what Higgins wants to do with Bellingcat: create a community of online citizen investigative journalists that can fact check or even unearth evidence using open source intelligence available online. Higgins has been doing this for years, parsing tens of thousands of YouTube videos coming out of Syria to figure out which ones were legitimate and which was were not.  Higgins was one of the first independent observers to confirm that the regime of Syria\\'s Bashar al-Assad had indeed used chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in August of last year, and he exposed Syrian arms trafficking from his house in Leicester, UK. Now, he wants to support others who are doing the same kind of work, and teach those who want to obtain similar skills.  \"It\\'s important to note these investigations were done by a variety of people, showing the importance of making open source investigation tools and techniques available to anyone,\" Higgins wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. \"This is what Bellingcat is about.\" For more on the story of Brown Moses:        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

SEE ALSO: Marvel 'Mystery' Movie: 9 Things Fox Could Have Up Its Spandex Sleeve That revelation, by way of the film’s release overseas, touched off a wave of speculation that Sony, owner of the Spider-Man\\xa0movie franchise, and 20th Century Fox, which owns X-Men, might be engaged in some kind of major new crossover to mirror the two superheroes’ frequent collaborations in the comic books. Strike up the sad trombones, nerds: It’s just a one-off. And the reason for it is pretty standard Hollywood back-scratching. The three-way split of Marvel properties (Disney owns the big guns with the Avengers and dozens of other characters) continues to be a source of frustration for comic geeks who would love to see more team-ups along the lines of the ones we’ve been reading about (and playing in video games) for decades. But as long as Disney, Sony and Fox keep making their respective Avengers, Spider-Man and X-Men films, they’ll retain those rights, keeping a wall of corporate protection between the characters. In other words, there’s precious little hope that something like Avengers vs. X-Men, Marvel’s 12-issue special event from 2012, would ever be done in movie form. So why in the world would Sony stick a Fox promo at the end of its major summer tentpole? Variety reported Wednesday afternoon that it was a simple backroom deal: In order to direct Spider-Man, Marc Webb had to break an existing contract to direct another Fox movie. To make up for it, Sony offered the free promo opportunity. But it was cool to hope -– if even for a minute. \",\n",
       " ' There are so many reasons why you may need to reinvent your career. Maybe you’re looking to reenter the workforce after staying home raising your kids. Or you might have lost your job after twenty years with the same company. Or perhaps the thought of going into your job just one more day makes you want to do a Jerry Maguire. No matter what your age or motivation, it’s not as impossible as it may seem to reinvent your career. Here’s how. Decide what you want to do. Now more than ever is the time to really, truly figure out what you’d like to do in your professional life. Just because you’ve toiled away as an ad exec doesn’t mean that you’ll continue on that career path until retirement. If you’re clueless as to what the next phase in your career will be, simply look to your hobbies. Discover what gives you joy in life, then determine a way to find work in that field.  Establish a timeframe. Once you decide which direction you want to take your career in, you’ll want to get there — now. But you’ll need to take the time as you carefully lay down the foundation for your career. Do some research to learn of potential jobs in your area of interest and to also get an idea of how long it might take before you can start working in your new profession. Depending on where you are in life, you may need to find a remote job or one that offers flex. So be sure to look for these job characteristics when job hunting. Get guidance. If you’re lucky, you’ll already know people who can help you as you begin your new career. If all of your contacts are from your former industry, you’ll need to find a potential mentor for your new career. A great way to gain new connections is to request informational interviews with companies that align with your new career goals. Not only will you get an in-depth look into this potential job field, but you’ll also get to meet industry heavy-hitters who, if you form a connection with, can possibly mentor you along the way. Build new skills. It may seem impossible to marry your old professional life with your new one, but there’s a great chance that you already possess some of the skills you’ll need in order to make your new career a smashing success. So take a look at your previous work experience and write down all of the skills you’ve utilized in those jobs. Then assess the skills you’ll need in order to get work in your new career. Redesign your resume to highlight those skills, and see if you can take a class or attend webinars in order to build skills that can help you moving forward. Be flexible. Starting out in a new field may mean that you’ll start out in a lower position than you’ve previously held. It may also equal taking a financial hit by earning a lower salary than you’re used to. Just keep in mind that these are all just mere milestones as you work towards gaining footing in your new career — and a happier, healthier work life balance. Reinvention at any age can be scary but it can also be an exciting time as you challenge yourself to find a position — and a career — that you truly love.

       " '     A straight-to-DVD or video-on-demand movie might raise suspicion. But in the maturing world of digital-first talent and production, it\\'s the only logical way. YouTube stars Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart and Mamrie Hart just made the leap from small screen to slightly less-small screen in Camp Takota, a feature film released on Feb. 14. For $10, fans can download or stream the movie, with extras including a behind-the-scenes documentary, movie posters and t-shirts packaged at incremental price tiers. And like many in the music, comedy and gaming worlds before them, its producers felt empowered to bypass traditional studio distribution because legions of rabid fans were already baked into the balance sheet.  Grace Helbig, Mamrie Hart and Hannah Hart star in Camp Takota.\"Our entire idea going into this project was that we wanted to respect our digital audience and give them the full look at what it\\'s like to make a film,\" Helbig tells Mashable. After shooting 12 hours a day, Helbig and her co-stars brought that experience back to their vlogs. \"All of the crew became characters in this vlog world. We really wanted to create an environment that the community lived in while the movie was getting made.\" This cycle of personal engagement is the engine powering Camp Takota\\'s marketing, and it seems to be working. \"The Camp Takota debut has been successful beyond even our most optimistic projections,\" says Michael Goldfine, president of RockStream Studios, which produced the film. According to RockStream, pre-sales, merchandise and other perks have made the film profitable on day one, though Mashable is unable to independently verify this at the time of publication. \"One thing we\\'re really proud of is we didn\\'t Kickstart this project. We didn\\'t ask people for money to create this,\" says Helbig. \"We\\'ve done sort of this reverse-Kickstarter.\" Fans who pay more than $10 to own the movie get additional perks, like Google Hangouts with the stars and personalized thank-you videos. \"We really set out to make a film by having a two-way conversation with the audience.\" The business model is not unlike other Internet experiments. Helbig cites Louis C.K.\\'s gamble on direct, DRM-free downloads as an inspiration for the venture. \"We\\'re not trailblazers in this space, but we wanted to push it further to see if total digital distribution would be successful,\" she says.  Grace Helbig on the set of \"Camp Takota.\"The other perk of a passionate community is that they\\'re extremely protective of their idols\\' work. \"They made a rule on Tumblr that there was no GIFing of the movie for the first 24 hours,\" she says. \"And they all stuck to it.\" Helbig cites instances where fans have thwarted pirated versions of the movie. \"They\\'ve organized this community watch thing where they report when someone\\'s pirated [the movie], which is so great, because that was one of our biggest worries. I think it\\'s only been pirated a handful of times, and instantly it\\'s been taken down because these kids all swarm on it.\" If this hybrid Internet-movie venture pays off, what\\'s next for Helbig? \"I don\\'t have a five-year plan,\" she says. \"My trajectory moving forward is saying \\'yes\\' to projects that make sense for the Grace Helbig brand and to work with friends and people who make me feel good about what I\\'m creating. That\\'s really my only goal. Right now, I\\'m working on a book and a television show, and I want to get into the more traditional pieces of media, but infusing it with Internet.

Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open.          21. Head-First Slide Fail Well, that\\'s one way of doing it...right?          22. Time Management Fail  Tie game, clock winding down — it\\'s always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. This classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut\\'s Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011.           23. Boogie Boarding Fail Its veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack.          24. Sportsmanship Fail  The summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. So it makes perfect sense that he\\'d let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That\\'s what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video.           25.

The protest seemed to be organized and centralized, though there were a few more vocal protestors on the fringes of the crowd. The New York Police Department had around 25 to 40 officers on hand, all of them off to the side — none of them in riot gear.

       " ' LONDON — British Prime Minister David Cameron has turned down a UK fashion magazine’s request to be photographed in a T-shirt with the slogan “This is What a Feminist Looks Like” despite other political leaders and personalities opting to wear the garment. UK Elle asked Cameron to wear the T-shirt for the magazine\\'s inaugural feminism issue, due out this month but the magazine said he refused five times. When asked why he wouldn’t wear the T-shirt, the magazine said the prime minister’s team offered to give a quote instead.  See also: Joseph Gordon-Levitt Wants to Know What Feminism Means to You Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband and other figures including actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hiddleston all donned the T-shirts for the magazine.   Image:  Elle UKWriting on UK Elle’s website, the magazine’s Editor-in-Chief Lorraine Candy says: \"This is a shame on so many levels, especially given he knew Nick Clegg and David Miliband had agreed without hesitation, alongside many other influential men who were more than happy to call themselves feminists.\"  \"It seems the prime minister still has an issue with the word \\'feminist.\\'\" \"I was personally disappointed that we couldn\\'t feature Mr. Cameron in our Feminism Issue because it is ELLE’s aim to engage with men in the fight for equality: because of parliament’s current gender imbalance, it is men who have the power to make changes in every area of British women’s lives. When the man in charge doesn’t engage, it doesn\\'t bode well.\"  We salute u @nick_clegg & @ed_miliband for wearing our feminist Tee with pride #ellefeminism http://t.co/DE4v78O6Gp pic.twitter.com/qc89EW6ZGe — Lorraine Candy (@LorraineELLE) October 27, 2014  The magazine said when the Prime Minister’s team was asked why he wouldn’t wear the T-shirt, they said he would rather give the following quote instead:  “Whether you are a man or a woman, I passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls. As a parent I feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son. As a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey hasn’t finished yet, which is why I am committed to doing everything I can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society.” The Fawcett Society, a UK charity working on women’s rights and equality that collaborated on the T-shirt, expressed disappointment that the prime minister didn’t partake.  Daisy Sands, head of policy and campaigns at the Fawcett Society said she was pleased that Clegg and Miliband participated but added: “It would appear that Cameron is not comfortable with identifying himself with the cause of feminism which, given the huge contribution that the feminist movement has made to advancing women’s rights, is unfortunate.”  This isn’t the first time the Prime Minister has been in the headlines for not describing himself as a feminist. Last year, when asked by another UK publication, Red magazine, if he was a feminist, Cameron responded: “I don’t know what I’d call myself... it’s up to others to attach labels. But I believe men and women should be treated equally.” However in a later interview with Channel 4 News, Cameron said: “When I was asked that question, I think what I should have said is, if that means an equalist, equal rights for women, then yes … the short answer is that if feminism is about equal rights for women, then yes.”       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' HONG KONG — Hong Kong\\'s leader said Tuesday that China won\\'t back down from its decision to limit voting reforms in the Asian financial hub, dashing hopes that the standoff between demonstrators and authorities could be resolved quickly through negotiations. As pro-democracy protests that have blocked Hong Kong\\'s streets entered a fifth day, the unequivocal statement from Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying does not come as a surprise. Showing a willingness to talk would have made the Chinese leadership in Beijing appear weak, which could embolden dissidents and separatists on the mainland. See also: Hong Kong Protests: What You Need to Know About the Umbrella Revolution Leung, a Beijing appointee who is deeply mistrusted by the people, said that mainland communist leaders would not reverse their August decision requiring a pro-Beijing panel to screen candidates in the territory\\'s first direct elections, scheduled for 2017. \"The central government will not rescind its decision,\" said Leung, adding that he wouldn\\'t step down before then — rejecting one of the protesters\\' demands. See what it\\'s like to walk through the protest: There was no immediate response from Occupy Central, the main civil disobedience group, but said in a tweet that the broader pro-democracy movement had set a Wednesday deadline for Leung meet their demands, which include genuine democracy and his resignation. It said it would \"announce new civil disobedience plans same day,\" without elaborating. Despite Leung\\'s urgings that they disperse and go home, thousands of people — many of them university and high school students — gathered on a six-lane highway next to the local government headquarters. The protesters\\' chief demand is that they don\\'t want Beijing to screen nominees for Hong Kong\\'s leadership elections. They see the central government as reneging on a promise that the chief executive would eventually be chosen through \"universal suffrage.\" \"The people on the streets are here because we\\'ve made the decision ourselves and we will only leave when we have achieved something,\" said Chloe Cheung, a 20-year-old student at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. \"We are waiting for the government to respond to our demands for democracy and a say in what the elections will be like.\" Student leaders planned to make their own announcement Tuesday about further plans and demands.  Hong Kong shows Beijing exactly what democracy can look like http://t.co/lVYzCPnEuM Photo: Carlos Barria-Reuters pic.twitter.com/IzuoGY0Q2r — TIME.com (@TIME) September 30, 2014  Even larger crowds are expected to flood the streets Wednesday, China\\'s National Day holiday. The government said it was canceling a fireworks display to mark the day. On Sunday, police shocked the city by firing tear gas at crowds, but protesters passed a peaceful night Monday singing as they blocked streets in several parts of Hong Kong. Crowds chanted calls for Leung to resign, and sang anthems calling for freedom. Police said they used 87 rounds of tear gas Sunday in what they called a necessary but restrained response to protesters pushing through cordons and barricades. They said 41 people were injured, including 12 police officers. \"Police cordon lines were heavily charged by some violent protesters. So police had to use the minimum force in order to separate the distance at that moment between the protesters and also the police,\" said Cheung Tak-keung, the assistant police commissioner for operations. Officials announced that schools in some districts of Hong Kong would remain closed Tuesday because of safety concerns, while dozens of bus routes were canceled and some subway stops near protest areas were closed. The protests have been dubbed the \"Umbrella Revolution\" by some, because the crowds have used umbrellas to not only block the sun, but also to deflect police pepper spray. Political slogans calling for freedom have also been written on the umbrellas.

Under an agreement set in 1984, before most of them were born, Beijing promised to allow Hong Kong residents civil liberties — unseen in the rest of China — after it took control of the city in 1997. China\\'s communist leaders take a hard line against any threat to their monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country\\'s far west, but it cannot crack down too harshly on the semi-autonomous territory where a freewheeling media ensures global visibility. Across the border, Chinese state media have provided scant coverage of the protests beyond noting that an illegal gathering spun out of control and was being curtailed by police.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",
       " ' Microsoft indirectly hinted that Skype communications can be intercepted and handed over to the National Security Agency, according to two privacy and security researchers\\' interpretation of the latest statement by the company regarding NSA surveillance. In a long blog post addressing the latest reports that said Microsoft helped the NSA spy on its users, the company equated Skype with traditional calls, saying that it \"[assumes] that all calls, whether over the Internet or by fixed line or mobile phone, will offer similar levels of privacy and security.\"  See also: Yahoo Forces Secretive FISA Court to Disclose 2008 PRISM Case For security experts, that means Skype calls are at the mercy of NSA requests, just like traditional phone calls made with landlines or cellphones. In other words, the U.S. government, through its PRISM program, can legally compel Microsoft to hand over Skype communications, something that the company previously denied was even possible at a technical level.  \"That\\'s the most telling sentence,\" privacy researcher Ashkan Soltani told Mashable. \"They\\'re implying that until they can say more, all they\\'re going to say is \\'don\\'t assume Skype is different.\\'”  His conclusion is based on the fact that Microsoft does not deny it like it used to in the past, and that Skype is compared to \"other technologies that do allow interception,\" he said. In a tweet, ACLU\\'s principal technologist and senior policy analyst Christopher Soghoian echoed Soltani\\'s thoughts: \"Microsoft, a company with dozens of cryptographers, aims to offer same security and privacy for Internet calls as regular phones (aka none).\"  Microsoft, a company with dozens of cryptographers, aims to offer same security and privacy for Internet calls as regular phones (aka none). — Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) July 16, 2013  The statement by Microsoft\\'s General Counsel Brad Smith, however ambiguous, is a far cry from what Skype claimed in 2008.  At the time, the company — which was owned by eBay — claimed it couldn\\'t possibly comply with wiretap requests because of Skype\\'s \"peer-to-peer architecture and encryption techniques,\" as reported by CNET.  In the following years, experts have questioned that claim.  A Microsoft spokesperson declined to elaborate. When asked by Mashable to clarify that sentence, and asked directly whether it means that Skype calls can be tapped just like regular calls over fixed lines and mobile phones, the spokesperson said that when the company was last asked about that, it declined to comment, and that its position hasn\\'t changed since then. Microsoft released its lengthy statement to respond to last week\\'s allegations that the company had actively helped the NSA and the FBI spy on its users. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden to The Guardian, the company has changed Skype\\'s architecture to make it possible to hand over audio and video calls. Additionally, The Guardian report alleged that Microsoft was giving access to emails and chats before they were even encrypted. An allegation that Microsoft denied.  See also: Is It the Dawn of the Encryption App? \"To be clear, we do not provide any government with the ability to break the encryption, nor do we provide the government with the encryption keys,\" Smith wrote. \"When we are legally obligated to comply with demands, we pull the specified content from our servers where it sits in an unencrypted state, and then we provide it to the government agency.\" Even though this explanation still lacks a lot of technical details, Soltani thinks that this could be explained by an infographic that speculates how PRISM works, which he published in June. Soltani speculated then, as he does now, that Microsoft responds to PRISM requests by sending the data to a separate server or \"dropbox\" that can then be accessed by the NSA.  Without more details, however, we can\\'t know for sure how the system works, and for Soltani that\\'s the most important thing.  \"Besides the legal question, knowing the specifics of the technical architecture will really help understand the actual scope and impact of this program,\" he said. \"We can\\'t have oversight without knowing exactly what technically is being \\'scooped up\\' by the legal request.\" In the statement, Microsoft also reiterates what all big tech companies have denied following the PRISM revelations — that it doesn\\'t give \"direct and unfettered access\" to customer data.  Additionally, Microsoft sent a letter (embedded below) to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, asking him to get directly involved and let the company reveal more details about how it responds to government requests. Microsoft argues that it has been trying to disclose more since the very first leaks. First it asked the Department of Justice and the FBI for permission, then it went to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) on June 19. The court still has yet to respond to Microsoft\\'s motion.  And despite all these pleas, \"we’re not making adequate progress,\" wrote Smith in the letter. Ultimately, Microsoft argues it has a constitutional right to disclose more information and respond to media reports based on the documents leaked by Snowden.  \"We believe the U.S. Constitution guarantees our freedom to share more information,\" reads Smith\\'s blog post. \"The United States has been a role model by guaranteeing a Constitutional right to free speech. We want to exercise that right. With U.S. Government lawyers stopping us from sharing more information with the public, we need the Attorney General to uphold the Constitution.\" Microsoft Letter to the Attorney General  Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' Facebook announced a new version of its iOS app on Wednesday to correspond with the launch of iOS 7. The new version of the Facebook app, which will be available in the App Store later on Wednesday, has been completely redesigned to fit within the new operating system, says Michael Sharon, Facebook\\'s product manager for iOS.  The most noticeable design change is that the app\\'s main navigation bar has been moved to the bottom of the screen, replacing the old navigation bar at the top of screen. The new design also eliminates the tool bar that slid out from the left-hand side of the app in the old version. See also: 10 Apps You Need to Dominate Your Work Day The new navigation bar across the bottom of the screen features tabs for News Feed, Friend Requests, Notifications, Messages, and a \"More\" tab that serves a similar purpose to the old left-hand tool bar. Sharon refers to the \"More\" tab as a \"bonus tab,\" allowing users to open up other areas of Facebook like Events or Photos without losing their place in other tabs. For example, a user could begin to comment on an item from his or her News Feed, then check her Events without losing her half-finished comment. In the old version, leaving the comment to check another area of the app would have resulted in the comment disappearing.  Users can also swipe across the new navigation bar to move from one tab to another, says Sharon.    The new iOS 7 Facebook app also has new aesthetic features to go along with the operating system\\'s new functionality, says Sharon. The app\\'s search and navigation bar across the top is translucent, and icons like the \"paperclip\" (used to denote an attachment) and the lettering in messages have been visually updated to \"make the app feel at home\" within iOS 7, says Sharon.  Facebook has been testing different versions of the navigation bar since March, and at any given time over the past six months there have been 1 to 2 million users unknowingly utilizing versions of the redesigned navigation bar, says Sharon. Through feedback from users, Facebook made changes to the tab in preparation for Wednesday\\'s launch, including removing Timeline as a widget. At one point, Facebook took the an early version of the navigation bar away from its test users only to receive negative app reviews and feedback from people asking for it back, says Sharon.   The new iOS app is also available to users with iOS 5 or iOS 6, says Sharon, although there are small stylistic differences between the versions, including the color of the navigation bar. Facebook\\'s new iOS app is available for mobile phones only — iPad users will still see the old design. Facebook has no plans to bring the new design to iPad, says Sharon, who added that the old design is a better fit for how users navigate Facebook on tablets.  Facebook will continue to test the iOS app and plans to update it regularly moving forward based on user feedback, says Sharon. The new design will not affect Facebook\\'s Android app, which it will continue to test independently, he adds.  What do you think of Facebook\\'s new iOS redesign? Tell us in the comments below.   Hands On With iOS 7        Starting Up From the moment iOS 7 loads, its clear this is different. The linen that infused iOS 5 and iOS 6 is gone, replaced with white and thin sans serif typography.          A Splash of Color While white is a predominant theme in iOS 7, this is not a monochrome OS. Color accents are almost always visible.          The New Home Screen  For the first time since the original iPhone, the overall look and icon structure of iOS is now new and fresh.  The wallpaper can now be dynamic or static. Dynamic wallpaper is similar to the animated wallpaper in Android, except it doesn\\'t interact with your finger. The default wallpaper is static.           A Cleaner Inbox Mail has received a full revamp to both its main view and the compose screen.          New Integrated Services Flickr and Vimeo join Facebook and Twitter as built-in services.          Folders and Control Center  Swiping up from the bottom brings up the Control Center. This is an easy way to access your most used settings, including WiFi, audio, brightness and quick access to alarm, a calculator, camera and flashlight. Meanwhile, photos can now store more items and span pages.           Camera Options The new camera interface has a number of options built-in. Swiping across the bottom brings up options for the standard camera or the video camera.          Instagram Friendly There is a new square mode on the camera, perfect for Instagram. The panorama mode is still here too.          Houston We Have Filters Apple also has its own filters built-into iOS 7. Rather than simply applying a filter in post, these filters are actually real-time and you can look through the viewfinder in that filter before taking a shot.          Stocks and Notes The Stocks app looks totally fresh. Notes also has a new coat of paint. The texture is still there but the yellow lined paper and Marker Felt are a thing of the past.          iTunes and Wish Lists iTunes and the App Store both have new designs. Additionally, Apple has introduced a new Wish List feature on mobile, making it easy for users to save an app to buy later.          App Store The App Store structure is still the same but the look is more fresh. In addition to the general charts, users can also check to see what apps are popular in their area.          Sharing Or Adding to a Wishlist A new share button shows off what you can do with an app which includes AirDrop and adding it to a wishlist.          Passbook and News Stand Both look fresh.          Lock Screen   The Lock screen no longer has anything to slide to unlock, just swipe to the right. You can choose to make Control Center available at the lock screen or not.           Notifications and Weather  Pulling down from the top still brings up notifications, only now without linen and with a history. The weather app is beautiful and animated.           Reminders  Reminders is now more robust in its appearance. There are different groups of reminders, not just lists.  The new reminder screen also has a refined look. It still has texture, but the lines are less bold.           Compass The compass looks totally new and totally great.          Switching Apps  Double tapping home brings up full screen previews of various apps. Scroll back and forth and see previews of your apps in real-time. Some might say this is copying Window Phone, but really, this look was pioneered by Palm with the late, great, webOS.           Dialer and Messages The dialer and the iMessage interface follow the new trends of being bright and with lots fo color.          Notifications Notifications pop-up in dark now, not white.           Calendar The calendar is de-leathered and has a very Google+ look.          Calendar Inbox The calendar gets a proper inbox for incoming invitations.          Maps Apple Maps has toned down some of its textures but the basic app looks very similar.          Directions The directions page in Maps has been rebuilt and it looks much more sleek.          Calculator and Clock  The calculator still pays homage to the great HP calculators of the 70s, but with fewer bevels. As for the clock, gone is that patent-infringing world clock look.            Alarms and Stopwatch Check out the 3D effect when picking a time.          Timer and Settings The timer is totally new too. This is what one of the standard settings pages looks like.          Safari  The bookmarks section for Safari is texture free but full of color. The search and URL omnibox makes a glorious return (it was separated with iOS 3 back in 2009). The whole look of this browser would look equally at home at Mountain View as it does in Cupertino.           Searching and Loading a Page  Typing in a URL or string of text offers up real-time suggestions for an address or search query. The thin bar at the top of the screen indicates page load progress.           Tabs It\\'s like Cover Flow, but vertical!          FaceTime Audio FaceTime can now do audio calls!

       " ' Despite being the outcast in Mean Girls, Janis Ian carried a deeper meaning than the Plastics could ever fathom.  She\\'s more widely recognized as that fictional teenager, but the real Janis Ian was a singer-songwriter who, in 1975, wrote what is perhaps the most quintessentially angst-ridden adolescent ballad. Her Grammy-winning song \"At Seventeen\" sums up the \\'Mean Girls\\' message and the struggle of the teen years in a way that\\'s still relatable. See also: 12 Mean Girls Who Belong in History\\'s \\'Burn Book\\'  Though I didn’t know much about Tina Fey when I first saw Mean Girls 10 years ago, I knew I had stumbled upon a kindred spirit when the Burn Book revealed Janis’ last name as Ian. It was so subtle, waiting until the middle of the film to fully acknowledge the reference, but its impact was huge impact for those familiar with the singer.  The homage makes perfect sense: Ian\\'s lyrics speak so acutely to the social struggles of the downtrodden high schooler. Except, unlike the witty movie quotes we still repeat today, her vocals are emotionally palpable. Taylor Swift is probably like, “Damn, this girl is deep.”  Lamenting 17 as the age when she learned \"the truth,\" Ian reflects on the high school chasm between \"beauty queens\" and \"ugly ducklings.\" The pressures of complicated reputations, unrequited crushes and clique clashes that most of us drowned in during our youth is transformed into poetry, as she croons about our \"ravaged faces\" versus those with \"clear-skinned smiles.\"   Image: Tumblr coloredyouthThe tune doesn\\'t really offer much by way of solace, mostly just a shoulder to cry on. But it does introduce a \"brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs, whose name I never could pronounce right\" — just like your high school best friend who was always there to remind you that those jerks would \"get what they deserved.\"   Image: Tumblr smurfsexualDespite the song ending as mournfully as it began, Fey thankfully gave the film a much happier ending, eventually creating compromise among the cliques. She also brought the real Ian back years later on an episode of 30 Rock, with a karaoke performance by Liz Lemon, fulfilling the angsty fantasies of so many former teens.   The hilarious scene pokes good-natured fun at the mopey ugly-duckling still inside of each us — and since, in real life, it was performed by perhaps the most successful female comedian of our generation, it was so fetch. Whether you’re 17, 15 or 27, let’s raise a glass to the original Janis Ian, without whom all the other Janis Ians would be lost. ',\n",
       " ' Move over, Bazinga. We\\'ve found a new television catchphrase for geeks — and it\\'s much funnier: \"You\\'re gay for my code.\" Destined to be repeated by developers everywhere, it\\'s a soon-to-be classic line that emerges from a hilarious scene in a hilarious episode. \"Proof of Concept\" follows the Pied Piper team, as they arrive in San Francisco, just one day before competing in startup competition TechCrunch Disrupt. Leading into its June 1 season finale, Silicon Valley\\'s seventh and penultimate episode dishes out big laughs and well-structured storylines. See also: \\'Silicon Valley\\' Episode 6 Recap: Let\\'s Control-Alt-Delete Some Subplots An outlandish subplot — in which Dinesh realizes he\\'s sexually aroused not by Charlotte, a friendly blonde he met at Disrupt, but by Gilfoyle\\'s top-notch Java code — produces episode 7\\'s memorable catchphrase. \"She doesn\\'t know Java. I wrote that code. You said you were in love with her mind. You realize what\\'s gong on, right? It\\'s not her you\\'re sexually attracted to. It\\'s my code. Just face it, Dinesh: You\\'re gay for my code. You\\'re code gay,\" Gilfoyle tells a flustered Dinesh. Writer Clay Tarver elevates the gag by depicting it visually on screen, with Dinesh failing to get aroused while hooking up with Charlotte until he gets a glimpse of Gilfoyle\\'s code. Also noteworthy: Viewers finally get to see some PG-rated make-out action on Silicon Valley (don\\'t get too excited, though — it\\'s still way too early to start a drinking game based on hookups, though this development is promising). There\\'s only one drawback in the entire scenario: Charlotte herself. A pink-shirt-wearing, code-clueless girl who represents a cupcake app isn\\'t what I had in mind when I asked to see more women with personality on the show. In fact, she\\'s uncomfortably close to the stereotype of a tech-ignorant woman. Luckily, Monica makes up somewhat for this misstep by being on top of her game throughout episode 7. Richard and Jared\\'s plots weave together seamlessly in a priceless comedy of errors that ultimately resolves both of their problems. For Richard, an ex-girlfriend named Sherry (Mary Holland) who\\'s spreading rumors about their dating history backs off because she thinks he\\'s gay (\"Richard, it\\'s none of my business, but be safe, okay?\"), and Jared finally gets the appreciation and approval he craves so much.    Richard\\'s ex-girlfriend Sherry (Mary Holland) in episode 7 of \\'Silicon Valley.\\'Image:  HBOWe also see Erlich being Erlich in full force. T.J. Miller is one of Silicon Valley\\'s stronger cast members, and \"Proof of Concept\" showcases his signature brash comedic style at its best. Case in point: Erlich wearing a black turtleneck à la Steve Jobs (naturally) while delivering a hilariously over-the-top introduction to Pied Piper\\'s preliminary-round presentation. Another gem is when Erlich obsesses over the meaning behind Disrupt judge Dan Melcher\\'s (Jake Broder) ambiguous finger gun: Was it a friendly acknowledgment or an implied threat? Many viewers were wondering how the show would deal with Peter Gregory\\'s absence after Christopher Evan Welch, who played Peter, died last year of lung cancer at 48 (his final appearance on the show was in episode 5, \"Signaling Risk\"). Judging from episodes 6 and 7, it looks like Monica will be Peter\\'s stand-in, while explaining away his repeated absences. This pales in comparison to Welch\\'s actual on-screen presence, but the excuses have been funny, well-crafted and most importantly — in the spirit of Peter Gregory-esque humor — appropriately ridiculous. Here\\'s episode 7\\'s reason, for example: \"Peter\\'s on safari with Lorne Michaels and Kanye West until next week.\"  On a less positive note, while I hate to sound like a broken record, Silicon Valley\\'s recurring accent-heavy Asian continues to be unfunny. The show\\'s satire of the Valley, however, hits the mark again — this time, poking fun at the tendency for high-minded startups to say they will \"revolutionize\" an industry and \"make the world a better place.\" Silicon Valley airs every Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.

       " ' Jasmin came into the shelter with a broken ankle, significant financial abuse and, most importantly, her two Shitzus, Tony and Teresa. She and the dogs were forced out of the house by her girlfriend of 19 years. While staying at her mother\\'s was an option, it wasn\\'t safe. Her girlfriend could find her there. But where could she go that would also take her animals? It\\'s a valid question that\\'s caused unnecessary suffering for many domestic violence victims. It\\'s unfortunately also why 48% of women in the U.S. choose to stay in abusive relationships. The resources for victims with pets in need of shelter are incredibly limited. Only 2% of shelters in the U.S. have any sort of program that factors pets into the family. New York City is the largest provider of domestic violence services in the country, with more than 50 shelters total. There is currently only one that allows pets in residence, and it\\'s only been in effect for a little over a year. The Urban Resource Institute\\'s PALS (People and Animals Living Safely) program strives to keep the entire family together in the middle of an already traumatic experience. See also: The Evolution of Women\\'s Workwear Through the Decades Jasmin made sure the court knew her dogs belonged to her. She paid for them and took care of them, even though they were purchased in her ex-partner\\'s name. Surprisingly, the legal system is not totally aware this option even exists yet. \"What shelter takes animals?\" the judge asked Jasmin\\'s lawyer. URI\\'s program launched in May 2013 with 10 apartments that housed families with small animals. The project has already expanded to 15 apartments (out of 32 total in the shelter) that now accept dogs too. Rita Garza is URI\\'s senior vice president of marketing, communications and development: “We recognize the value of the pet as a true member of the family. In addition to everything else that a domestic violence victim is experiencing just coming into a shelter, to ask them not be able to have their pet is for us unacceptable.\" To anyone who has ever owned or loved a pet, it seems like a no-brainer to think of animals as part of the family. They provide unconditional love and an emotional bond proven to provide powerful healing effects. \"I really couldn’t and I can’t be without them,\" says Jasmin of her two dogs, who live with her in the PALS program. \"They understand when I’m feeling down, and they make me laugh and I make them happy. And when you’re going through something like this, it’s a process.\"  Image:  Christina Ascani/MashableWhen you ask Jasmin about her dogs, her face lights up. She knows they\\'re safely down the hall, watching cartoons and just waiting for their mom to come home and share some of that chicken she\\'s cooking. \"When I first got here, I was a wreck. I was devastated, I was a broken person. I still am, but I understand where the cracks are now,\" said Jasmin. While it may seem obvious that animals belong with the family, physically adding them into a system that is fairly new and already complicated adds an additional layer of complexity. New York City’s regulations on domestic violence services do not incorporate pets. URI has implemented extensive planning and broad operational changes, working with the mayor\\'s alliance to address these issues and raise awareness among all the other systems (hotlines, other shelters, animal welfare, courts, the NYPD) that work within the domestic violence services community.  Image:  Christina Ascani/MashableOut of nearly 30 families URI has already helped in the PALS program, it has encountered horrific scenarios involving pets. Some abusers use pets as become leverage in the abuse, similar to how batterers use children to bring the mother back home. A cat had been duct taped, and placed in the microwave with the threat of turning the knob on. A dog was choked until he passed out. Pamela is a 59-year-old survivor in the program whose inter-generational story of abuse spans nearly her entire life — her mother was killed from domestic violence when she was 12. In 1998, an abusive relationship led to her house being set on fire, which killed her pet cat, Kissie. Years later, when she had to escape another relationship, Pamela\\'s pet cats Gizmo, Ricky and Lucy stayed with her son; she would visit and take care of them every day between working part-time. Simply knowing that the pet is being taken care of is a crucial part of the process. It allows the victim to finally focus on herself. \"I knew from losing Kissie in the fire, I didn’t want that to happen again — for them to be thrown out the window, or anything,\" Pamela said. She found URI and escaped to the shelter as one of the first PALS families in September 2013 with her cats.  Image: Christina Ascani/MashableJasmin had a unique experience finding the shelter. Her ex has a masters in social work and has been employed at other victim service shelters, which affected her options. It led her to a counselor who was dedicated to finding her a place with pets. That option turned her life around. \"When somebody calls the NYC DV hotline, there’s a lot more awareness now about our program,\" says program director Kenneth McCrae. \"But still, when a victim calls the hotline, there could be many things at stake...A lot of people will not disclose they have a pet because they’re just fearful of any kind of barrier.\" The hotline receives thousands of calls per day, so while 15 apartments is a start, it\\'s a limited option. For those who can\\'t come into the shelter, URI relies heavily on partnerships with the ASPCA and animal welfare communities. Purina has been a crucial partner for the program since the beginning, providing supplies like food, toys and crates. It also donated a dog park that\\'s attached to the building for pets to safely play — a big step toward including dogs in the program. But animals who come into the shelter require physical and psychological medical attention, too. URI also works with families in and out of the shelter to provide pet foster care, boarding or some alternative. A woman who just left the shelter after six months in the program, the maximum stay legally allowed in all NYC shelters, is currently boarding her chihuahua while she and her two children are on a wait list for an apartment. In the meantime, she\\'s entered the general homeless system, but knowing the pet will be returned and is safe is a critical part of the family\\'s healing process.  Image:  Christina Ascani/MashableThese women are going through unspeakably traumatic experiences. They carry feelings of guilt, self-blame and deep trust issues to a place full of strangers. Being forced to abandon one of their only comforts, their pets, only does further damage. Knowing the animal is safe means these women can focus on themselves — and truly heal. \"At the end of the day, I have my pets and all the things I look forward to,\" Jasmin said. \"I want to get married. I want to have a healthy relationship — I want to know what that’s like. I want to have kids, I want to add little humans to my furry baby family. And those are things that keep me going.\" Editor\\'s note: If you are experiencing abuse, you are not alone. Call the 24-hour hotline for help: 1-800-621-HOPE (4673). ',\n",
       " ' An emoji says a thousand words.  The little digital images are everywhere, from smartphone operating systems to social media and apps. We\\'re obsessed, sending an emoji of a dancer next to a smiley face next to crying cat. How did these tiny images take hold of our lives? See also: How to Enable Emoji on iOS \"Emoji are a great way to add personality to a text-based conversation,\" says Jeremy Burge, the founder of website Emojipedia. Like the name suggests, it\\'s an encyclopedia for all things emoji, cataloging each creative symbol.  For the quick text generation, sometimes sending one tiny emoji is easier than typing up a response. Everything needs to be conveyed immediately, and nothing is smaller or more expressive than an image. However, the psychology behind emoji obsession runs a little deeper. In February, Dr. Owen Churches, of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Australia, conducted a study on emoticons. His research showed that people reacted to emoticons the same way they would react to a real human face.  Image:  Giphy  The human brain learned to recognize an emoticon such as \":-)\" because it interpreted it so often. It had become a \"culturally-created neural response.\" Churches believes the same reaction could occur with emoji, particularly the ones with faces, in the future. \"I would expect the response of face sensitive parts of the cortex to emoji would be very similar to that of real faces,\" Churches tells Mashable. From a vision perspective, emoji are similar to faces, more so than emoticons, he explains. This makes it more personal than just being a cartoonish image on a glowing screen.  The use of emoticons has also been scientifically proven to help boost communication. In 1996, researchers at New Mexico State University conducted an experiment in which they gave two groups of 12 people a task to solve together. The groups had to communicate via computers; one had the option to use emoticons, the other did not.  The study found that 10 out of the 12 subjects chose to use the emoticons when offered, and, overall, the entire group enjoyed the process more than the non-emoticon team. Other studies have shown emoticons amplify whatever message we\\'re trying to send. A sad emoticon makes a written message seem sadder, while the same is true for happy emoticons.  While the same study has not been conducted with emoji specifically, it\\'s easy to hypothesize similar results. The generation that is growing up with emoji now is more likely to become comfortable with and attached to using the colorful icons. A few emoji options available on iOS, OS X and WhatsApp.Image:  Emojipedia  Now, with the numerous emoji options, and the 250 new ones arriving soon, which emoji are we actually obsessed with? Data aggregation site FiveThirtyEight created a code to find out the most popular emoji used on Twitter, as of June 2014.  Hearts topped the list with 342 million tweets, followed by \"Joy,\" a face laughing with tears coming out of its eyes, the \"Unamused\" face, the \"Heart Eyes\" face and the \"Relaxed\" face.  Heart eyes emojis used by Apple, Google and Twitter.Image:  Emojipedia  Emoji also pervade our culture. They\\'re all around us, and our brain has learned to adapt to their popularity and create \"efficient neural responses to these stimuli,\" Churches says. In 2009, a Kickstarter project was successfully funded for there to be an emoji translation of Herman Melville\\'s Moby Dick (called, of course, Emoji Dick).  NBA player Mike Scott covered his arm in emoji tattoos. TV shows like the millennial-leaning Girls make self-aware emoji jokes. Beyoncé recently released emoji-themed merchandise. Katy Perry made an entire music video for \"Roar\" using emoji as lyrics.   You can also legally threaten someone with emoji. They\\'re part of the lexicon, an understood part of the language, no matter how silly they seem. They\\'re also a universally understood mode of communication.  Emoji symbols originated in Japan in the late \\'90s. Though they vary depending on what platform they\\'re used on (i.e., iPhone vs. Android), they still bear great similarities to one another. So go ahead, put that smiley face next to a frowning face next to a ghost. It\\'s the same in every language.  BONUS: 5 Emoji Meanings That Might Surprise You  ',\n",

       " ' Boeing chose to use the most combustible of the standard lithium-ion chemistries on the market in its flagship 787 Dreamliner. The advanced aircraft is grounded around the world after a battery burst into flames. The suspension of all 50 working Dreamliners follows a Jan. 16 emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways pilot after he smelled something burning, and saw a cockpit warning light up indicating a battery problem. It turned out that one of the plane\\'s batteries had caught fire. Investigators are working to determine why — faulty wiring, design, system assembly, or the battery itself. In the photo above, a leaking battery is carried out of an All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane at Takamatsu airport on Janaury 17, 2013 after the plane made an emergency landing at the airport the day before. Boeing, for whom the Dreamliner is key to the company\\'s growth plans, has been the target of scrutiny because of a long series of failures in the aircraft. Now the glare is focused on its lithium-ion batteries. But blaming this type of battery for the fault would be like scorning all automobiles because of the Ford Pinto. In fact, lithium ion batteries are not all the same. Experts note that Boeing chose to rely on a lithium cobalt oxide battery configuration for the 787, a chemistry that, while delivering powerful performance, has in the past been responsible for fires in laptop computers and cellphones. The 787 battery is manufactured by Japan\\'s GS Yuasa, one of the most respected lithium ion battery makers in the world. In its hybrid-electric Volt car, for example, GM chose to use a battery combining lithium with two ion chemistries — nickel manganese cobalt, and manganese spinel. China\\'s BYD uses yet a third chemistry: lithium iron phosphate. What all three have in common, experts say, is that they are far less flammable than lithium cobalt oxide. \"It\\'s essentially due to the crystalline structure,\" Shu Sun, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told me in an email exchange. \"The olivine and spinal structure of [lithium iron phosphate and manganese spinel] make them safer.\" All five experts interviewed for this post also emphasized that, while the chemistry is important, safety comes as well in the design of the battery system and the electronics installed to govern its use. \"I suspect the real problem lies in the cell assembly by [GS Yuasa] and, perhaps more important, the control circuitry design,\" said Ralph Brodd, one of the world\\'s most respected battery experts. Brodd said that Tesla, for example, uses a nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry. \"Tesla developed a sophisticated algorithm to measure voltage, current and temperature for each cell in their pack,\" Brodd told me. \"If one fails or acts up, it can disconnect that individual cell without interrupting the operation of the battery. That is what Boeing needs to do.\" A Boeing spokeswoman, asked to respond to this, said, \"Lithium ion batteries were selected after a careful review of available alternatives because they best met the performance and design objectives of the 787. There are multiple backups to ensure the system is safe. These include protections against over-charging and over-discharging.\" The makers of vehicles and electronic devices make a choice in their battery selection, depending on their requirements: What chemistry will deliver electricity the fastest, with the most punch, and the longest period of time? Electronics can help correct for error if you get greedy and demand too much. But the chemistry does in fact matter. As one battery expert told me, \"Batteries are inherently unstable devices (we call them \\'charged\\' for a reason!).\" Photo via AFP/Getty Images, JIJI PRESS  Apple’s sales and profit fell for the first time since 2001 Texas just became a swing state What the AT&T-Time; Warner merger means for HBO A Matrix-like hallucinogenic pill may be the future of entertainment, says Netflix’s CEO   This article originally published at Quartz here  ',\n",

The rumors of American mercenaries at work in Ukraine last surfaced in a statement on the Russian foreign ministry\\'s website on April 8. U.S. contractor Academi (formerly Blackwater) denied the accusations at the time. \"Academi is not taking part in any operations in Ukraine, and in the future this is not planned,\" a spokesperson for the company stated. White House spokesperson Jay Carney called the rumors \"bogus,\" and the American ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt said they were \"rubbish.\" Dozens have been killed in recent weeks as pro-Kiev forces square off with pro-Russian rebels in a number of east Ukrainian cities.

       " \" Airborne laser scanning has revealed the remnants of a vast urban structure in the vicinity of Angkor Wat, a famous temple in Cambodia. The study, which will be published soon in the journal PNAS, follows earlier research that showed Angkor Wat to have been one of the world's most complex preindustrial cities. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is making it easier for archaeologists to explore human settlements in tropical vegetation; previous LIDAR work has found evidence of new cities in Central America, in addition to further enhancing the layout of known settlements such as the Mayan city of Caracol. For the new study, the researchers used a LIDAR setup emitting up to 200,000 laser pulses each second from a helicopter. Amazingly, the entire operation for the data collection spanned just two days in April 2012 for a total 20 hours of flight time, capturing imagery that would have taken many years to assemble from the ground, if at all. The LIDAR analysis also appears to have discovered what could be an older city beside Angkor Wat.  A digital recreation of Angkor Wat temple site (top) based on raw LIDAR digital terrain data (bottom). Image courtesy of PNAS. The study has revealed new canals, temples and still unidentified manmade features, confirming a metropolitan area that housed many thousands of people, much as the Giza Plateau Mapping Project is doing for cities surrounding the Pyramids construction in Egypt. As LIDAR technology gets cheaper, it will accelerate our understanding of early human settlements from the lingering geographic footprints we left, traces which can be almost as shallow as a footprint itself. As the authors write in their PNAS paper:  LIDAR technology has recently matured to the point where it has become cost-effective for archaeologists with sufficient accuracy and precision to identify archaeological features of only a few centimeters in size.

Police Commissioner William Bratton has said the patrols are needed, and the development where Gurley was shot had recently seen a shooting, robberies and assaults. Officer Peter Liang and his partner, also new to the force, were patrolling a pitch-dark stairwell with flashlights late Thursday, police said. Gurley, 28, was leaving his girlfriend\\'s apartment after she had braided his hair, according to the girlfriend, who is not his daughter\\'s mother. Police said the officers walked down the stairs onto an eighth-floor landing when Gurley and his girlfriend opened a stairwell door one floor down, after giving up on waiting for an elevator. Police said Liang, patrolling with his gun drawn, fired without a word and apparently by accident, hitting Gurley from a distance of about 10 feet.

       " ' Each summer, amateur astronomers from all over the world look forward to observing the famous Perseid meteor shower, but often overlook six lesser celestial fireworks displays that reach their peak between July 28 and Aug. 20. This year, a bright nearly-full moon will seriously interfere with Perseid meteor observing, so why not take this opportunity to try and view the other six, all but one of which will enjoy dark skies. That minor meteor shower sextet begins on July 28, with the peak of the Delta Aquarid\\xa0meteor shower. The online Slooh community observatory will stream live views of the Delta Aquarids in a webcast on July 28 at 10 p.m. EDT (7 p.m. PDT/2 a.m. GMT) featuring views from observatories in Arizona and the Canary Islands. NASA, meanwhile, will provide a follow-up webcast on Tuesday night via all-sky cameras at the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Both the Slooh and NASA webcasts are dependent on weather conditions at their respective observing sites. You can watch the Delta Aquarid meteor shower webcasts on Space.com each night.          Minor meteor showers this summer In general, the Earth encounters richer meteoric activity during the second half of the year. And you\\'re more likely to see twice as many meteors per hour in the predawn hours as compared to the evening hours, weather permitting. This is due to the fact that during the pre-midnight hours we are on the \"trailing\" side of the Earth, due to our orbital motion through space. So any meteoric particle generally must have an orbital velocity greater than that of the Earth to \"catch\" us.  SEE ALSO: Amazing Meteor Shower Photos by Stargazers However, after midnight when observers are looking up from the Earth\\'s \"leading\" side, any particle that lies along the Earth\\'s orbital path will enter our atmosphere as a meteor. As such objects collide with the Earth\\'s atmosphere at speeds of 7 to 45 miles per second (11 to 72 km/second), their energy of motion rapidly dissipates in the form of heat, light, and ionization, creating short-lived streaks of light popularly referred to as \"shooting stars.\" Summertime meteors, occasionally flitting across your line of sight are especially noticeable between mid-July and the third week of August. And between Aug. 3 and Aug. 15, there are no fewer than six different minor displays that are active. These six are listed in the table included in this guide.  Image: Space.com/Joe RaoPatience and clear skies The only equipment you\\'ll need to see this summer\\'s meteor showers are your eyes, a modest amount of patience, good weather and dark skies. The actual number of meteors a single observer can see in an hour depends strongly on sky conditions. The rates given in the table are based on your ability to see stars as faint as magnitude +6.5 — considered to be the threshold of naked eye visibility — that you are an experienced observer, and an assumption that the radiant is directly overhead. The radiant is the place in the sky where the paths of shower members, if extended backward, would intersect when plotted on a star chart. Your clinched fist held at arm\\'s length is equal to roughly 10 degrees on the sky. So if the radiant is 30 degrees (\"three-fists\") above the horizon, the hourly rate is halved. At 15 degrees, it is cut to a third. While the hourly rates from these other meteor streams are but a fraction of the numbers produced by the Perseids, combined, overall they provide a wide variety of meteors of differing colors, speeds and trajectories. Among these are the Southern Delta Aquarids, which can produce faint, medium speed meteors; the Alpha Capricornids, described as \"slow, bright, long trailed yellowish meteors\" and the Kappa Cygnids which are classified as \"slow moving and sometimes producing brilliant flaring fireballs.\" As such, if you stay out and watch long enough, you may be nicely rewarded for the time spent. Note that five of the six showers listed in chart included in this guide, come from the region around the constellations of Aquarius and Capricornus. These constellations are currently highest in the southern sky between roughly 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. your local time. The moon will have already set earlier in the evening, leaving the after-midnight skies dark for the Southern and Northern Delta Aquarids, Alpha Capricornids, and Southern Iota Aquarids. As for the Kappa Cygnids and Northern Iota Aquarids, the moon will be waning in illumination, but will still shine at a relatively bright gibbous phase, which will unfortunately brighten the predawn morning sky.\\xa0Of these six minor showers, the Kappa Cygnids are the most favorably placed for northern observers. The constellation Cygnus lies high overhead at around midnight making it favorably placed for viewing all night long.

No protesters were seen at Uber offices in Chicago or Seattle. About 50 people protested outside the San Francisco office. Read more about the San Francisco protest. UPDATED 2:53 p.m. ET Uber drivers in several cities are set to stage a \"Global Day of Protest\" on Wednesday. From 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET, drivers in cities including New York, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and London plan to protest the app\\'s rating system, compensation, and driver safety and treatment. See also: Uber Cuts Prices in NYC, Claims It\\'s Now Cheaper Than Taxis The worldwide protest is the latest in a series of actions taken by drivers with the ridesharing company, which matches customers and drivers via mobile app. However, Uber says the protesters do not represent all drivers. “The group protesting today represents a fraction of all Uber partners; the reality is that thousands of partners are out driving on the platform right now,” an Uber spokesperson told Mashable. Drivers working for Uber, as well as other ridesharing companies like Lyft and Sidecar, do not belong to a union. Instead, they work as independent contractors. Protest organizers want to change that. A nonprofit called the California App-Based Drivers Association organized the Teamsters-supported protests in Los Angeles and San Diego, so Uber drivers can negotiate for better pay and working conditions. The organization has also been distributing fliers to spread the word about the global protest.  The flyer from CADA notifying drivers of a Global Day of Protest.Image:  CADAIn New York, Uber Drivers Network NYC said local drivers are working toward unionizing. The organizers posted on their Facebook page, calling for a strike Wednesday:  Post by Uber Drivers Network NYC. The post reiterated the goals of the Global Day of Protest, but took it a step further by calling specifically for a three-hour strike.  We ask ALL of you to stand in solidarity with CADA by SHUTTING OFF our Uber phones on Wednesday October 22nd 2014 [10/22]. Our phones will be OFF as a strike againt Uber! Join us to show them that WE make Uber and that without us, they don\\'t exist! On one online forum, however, some drivers have been confused about the protest\\'s details, asking if it would be a three- or 24-hour strike. An attempted strike in September faced similar challenges. On the Uber Drivers Network NYC Facebook page, organizers said it was difficult to inform drivers about the protest when it was clear some were still working.  Post by Uber Drivers Network NYC. Such divided opinions among Uber drivers suggests some are conflicted over whether protests are needed, or may be due to concerns that public protests will be condemned by the company. They could also be a result of difficulty in coordinating protests.  Uber sent the following statement to Mashable in response to Wednesday\\'s protests: “Four years ago, the only choice for drivers was to start the day more than $100 in the hole to rent a taxi -– today, hundreds of thousands of drivers take to the road on the Uber platform. Uber powers entrepreneurship by providing the tools to build a small business. The thousands of drivers driving on the platform at this moment are a testament to that opportunity.” BONUS: What Is Uber?        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#appId=116628718381794&xfbml=1&status=1&cookie=1\",\"facebook_jssdk\"); ',\n",

       " ' Blind and visually impaired children will now be able to experience classic picture books like Goodnight Moon and Harold and the Purple Crayon with the help of 3D printing technology. Researchers at the University of Colorado have created a new project that can convert standard picture books into 3D-printed pages, letting children with visual impairments follow the raised illustrations by touch as the stories are read aloud.   See also: 7 Things You Didn\\'t Know About 3D Printing Tom Yeh, an assistant professor in the university\\'s Department of Computer Science who directed the project, said the goal of The Tactile Picture Books Project is to use computer science to better people\\'s lives. \"I realized we could do something meaningful by interpreting pictures from these children\\'s books using mathematical diagrams,\" he said. \"This project is much more difficult than I envisioned, but it also is much more rewarding.\"  University of Colorado Boulder students Abby Stangl and Jeeeun Kim are using 3D printers to assist the blind in understanding pictures better.Image: University of Colorado Casey A. Cass/University of ColoradoThe project was created in partnership with the Anchor Center, an organization in Denver dedicated to supporting and educating vision impaired children. The center\\'s executive director, Alice Applebaum, told Mashable that books that can be read by touch — tactile books — are central to the education of vision impaired children.  “We often add texture to books; we have a room here where we add braille and things that children can feel to stories,\" she said. \"It’s just like when we learn how to read with our eyes, but they’re learning with all their other senses.”  Since many children don\\'t start reading braille until age 6, this program has given kids the chance to read with their families at even younger ages and get used to exploring with their hands. Applebaum said the center has always made tactile books \"the old-fashioned way,\" cutting and pasting textured items to traditional picture books. \"It is one more opportunity for visually impaired children to experience literacy in an expanded way,\" Applebaum said. \"Will it make them better readers? Not necessarily, but it will make them more aware of what the world looks like.\" Researchers at the university convert the images into 3D-printed books through computational algorithms. Yeh said the ultimate goal is to streamline the process so educators and parents of visually impaired children can take a photo of a children\\'s book and send the photo to a 3D printer to create a tactile book. \"We are investigating the scientific, technical and human issues that must be addressed before this vision can be fully realized,\" he said. \"Since each child generally has his or her unique visual impairment issues, the idea is to customize each book for each child.\" Abigale Stangl is a researcher for the project and a student in ATLAS, multidisciplinary Institute at the University of Colorado. She says feedback from children the Anchor Center was essential to their work.  \"We have seen a need and opportunity to make some of these practices more efficient and support development of custom learning tools and resources,” she told Mashable.  A page from the 3D-printed version of Harold and the Purple Crayon. Image: Tactile Picture Book Project A page from a 3D-printed version of Goodnight Moon with braille.Image:  Tactile Picture Book Project3D printing has greatly evolved in recent years, with the potential to change the production of everything from fashion to guns. Yeh said he hopes the project will make this technology more accessible to the public.  Several interfaces exist for designing 3D models, Yeh mentioned, such as Google SketchUp — but not many programs have been created with parents\\' needs in mind. The Tactile Picture Book Project is currently testing software programs and leading workshops to teach parents how to create their own books. Researchers hope to someday provide instructions and algorithms on their website so parents can create products with their own 3D printers; as 3D printing continues to grow in popularity and decrease in price, Yeh said, more people will be able to create books at home. Currently, tactile books are beautiful, but very labor-intensive and expensive, he added. But the future looks bright.  “Affordable 3D printing technology should be available in the very near future,\" he said. \"In two to three years, 3D printers could be less than $1,000.” Since the original Goodnight Moon book was 3D-printed, the Tactile Picture Books Project has added The Very Hungry Caterpillar and The Cat in the Hat to the collection, and it\\'s continuing to grow.

       " ' Life in a city can be dirty, cramped and inefficient, and the way it\\'s built can make those aspects even worse. However, sometimes architects go beyond simply making functional spaces to create a more positive impact on their homes. From vertical gyms to man-made marshes, architectural design can build solutions to key urban problems. See also: The Best Apps for the World\\'s Biggest Cities Here are six projects that have made, or can make, a major difference.  1. East River Blueway Plan (New York City) What it does: Opens access to East River and hampers flooding The key to keeping New York drier during a hurricane is making things a little bit wetter before it happens again. No, the streets of the Big Apple won\\'t be flooded to create an American Venice, but a four-mile strip of Manhattan along the East River will be turned into wetlands and pedestrian walkways. The project, called the East River Blueway, will give New Yorkers more space along the riverbank to roam, while creating a natural barrier that will help fight off flooding if another major storm like Hurricane Sandy hits the city. But flood abatement isn\\'t the only thing the project is intended to do. Claire Weisz, principal at WXY Architecture, says her firm\\'s project is also about reclaiming the East River shore for the people who live on it. \"This will create a kind of role model, the next generation of environmental edge or park. I think it will finally bring attention to the East River and those communities,\" she says. \"This will be a game-changer.\"  2. Bud Clark Commons (Portland, Oregon) What it does: Helps the city\\'s homeless men and women in an environmentally friendly way  Economic and environmental interests don\\'t always line up (see: oil industry), but the Bud Clark Commons bridges the divide, helping Portland\\'s homeless population get a fresh start in a sustainable building. Completed in 2011 and named after a former mayor of Portland, the commons features 130 studio apartments for homeless men and women subsidized by public housing allotments and Section 8 project vouchers. It also has a 90-bed transitional shelter for men who can\\'t quite afford their own place yet. The shelter provides sleeping, living and dining areas, along with food storage facilities, a bathroom and a dining area. There\\'s also a resource center that provides men and women in need with a wide variety of services that help them navigate the proper government channels for help, while sustaining their minds and bodies. On the environmental side, the building is LEED Platinum-certified, and it features greywater recycling, zero stormwater runoff and solar hot water. 3. The Creative Corridor (Little Rock, Arkansas) What it does: Creates an arts district along the city\\'s Main Street Little Rock as a great arts city? Don\\'t count it out just yet. The Creative Corridor project is slated to take a neglected four-block stretch of the city\\'s Main Street, give it a facelift and little bit of breathing room, and incorporate artistic elements to pump economic life into a currently unsafe area. \"There\\'s still a lot of perceptions — and maybe sometimes rightfully so — that Downtown Little Rock isn\\'t a safe place,\" says Stephen Luoni, director of the University of Arkansas Community Design Center and one of the project\\'s designers. \"What our design had to do is recalibrate it as a classic American main street, and change its purpose from a shopping street to a 24/7 livability street.\" Luoni says that beyond its artistic contributions, the project will also bring non-traffic social services, dining, assembly centers and recreation centers, a major component of a project brought to life with a tremendous amount of leadership, investment and enthusiasm from stakeholders. \"We really look at the street as an instrument for delivering more urban and ecological services to show what a city could be,\" he says. \"I think it\\'s going to show Little Rock and others the ability of the street in creating value, in creating livability.\" See also: Underground Cities: The Next Frontier Might Be Underneath Your Feet 4. Pearl Brewery Redevelopment (San Antonio, Texas) What it did: Took a 19th-century brewery and turned in into a culinary wonderland  The Pearl Brewer has gone from an abandoned relic to an integral part of San Antonio\\'s historic riverfront.Image: Flickr, Katie HauglandWhat do you do with an 131-year-old, 67,000 square-foot, abandoned brewery? Make it a riverside food emporium, of course. Pearl Brewery operated along the banks of the San Antonio River until it churned out its last beer in 1985. It lingered abandoned until 2002, when a massive redevelopment project started to bring it back to life.  It now hosts several restaurants featuring everything from Italian food to seafood specialties, a Latin American food store, several boutique stores and offices. There\\'s also stable, studio and amphitheater overlooking the city\\'s famous River Walk. 5. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Campus (Seattle, Washington) What it does: Restores a wildlife habitat while hosting a major philanthropic organization  Image: Flickr, Lester Public LibraryThe site of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation campus once hosted railway trestles, homesteads, farming, a street-car barn and a bus barn, according to Architect Magazine. Now, it hosts the second-largest LEED-NC Platinum building in the world, designed by Seattle-based firm NBBJ,  which helps restore 40% of the campus back to being a wild bird habitat. This is done with two acres of vegetated roofs on parking structures, which feature edible plants like blueberries, huckleberries and red flowering currant. There\\'s also an intricate rainwater filtering system and 46 solar hot water collectors, saving energy along with birds — and if the foundation\\'s will is done, the world. 6. Vertical Gyms (Caracas, Venezuela) What it did: Gave a Venezuelan barrio a rec center and cut crime by 30% in the process  The Barrio La Cruz neighborhood in Caracas is a difficult place to live, but Urban-Think Tank, an activist architecture firm, built a vertical climbing gym that stacks strength-training areas, tracks, soccer fields and other recreational spaces on top of each other. The firm claims that the crime rate in the barrio dropped 30% after the gym was built, and it currently entertains 15,000 visitors per month. ',\n",

       " ' Hate having to pay for hundreds of cable TV channels when you watch less than a dozen? How about those blackout rules that make it so you can\\'t watch your favorite NFL team when a home game isn\\'t sold out?  If Sen. John McCain gets his way — and that\\'s a big \"if\" — those two annoyances could be a thing of the past. Sen. McCain introduced a bill Thursday in Congress, the Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013. The act would \"encourage the wholesale and retail unbundling of programming by distributors and programmers.\"  That means if you want to subscribe to a single cable channel, such as ESPN, you would be able to do that without subscribing to any others. Here\\'s how the senior Senator from Arizona introduced his bill: \"For over 15 years I have supported giving consumers the ability to buy cable channels individually, also known as \\'a la carte\\' — to provide consumers more control over viewing options in their home and, as a result, their monthly cable bill.\" McCain says current bundling practices are \"unfair and wrong.\" In theory, this bill would make compliance with his a la carte plan voluntary. But program providers would be enticed into complying because of another law he wants to attach to the bill: one that makes dealing with copyright much easier for cable networks.  If cable and satellite programming purveyors wanted to enjoy the sweet deal they enjoy now — one where broadcast stations are forced to license their content to the cable and satellite providers — they\\'ll have to play along with McCain\\'s a la carte plan. McCain cited his next-door neighbor, a 74-year-old widow, who has to pay higher cable rates because of sports programming on ESPN (the most expensive cable channel), even though she never watches it. She ends up sending a check to Disney for about $70 for something she never uses.  \"Today, we\\'re putting up a stop sign,\" said McCain. McCain\\'s bill also forbids networks from downgrading their over-the-air broadcast signal so that customers will be forced to buy cable TV with higher-quality, non-degraded video. The law would threaten to take broadcasters off the air by taking away their broadcast frequencies and having the FCC auction them off.  Sports fans should love McCain\\'s proposed repeal of blackout rules. Under his bill, cable subscribers would be able to watch local games played in stadiums that are publicly financed, which includes many stadiums and teams that are supported by local taxes.  What\\'s in doubt is what this bill would do to prices. Will it make cable and satellite TV more expensive — as it has done in Europe — or will people spend less on subscriptions overall because they\\'re only getting the channels they want?  Either way, the cable industry lobbyists will have a field day trying to block this bill.  Would you prefer a la carte programming? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

       " ' Samsung Electronics Co. will invest $18 billion in its memory-chip and display businesses this year as the world’s biggest smartphone maker tries to ward off slowing demand for high-end devices such as its Galaxy S4. Capital spending for those divisions will increase to 19.5 trillion won as the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates. Net income, excluding minority interest, rose 50% to 7.58 trillion, compared with the 8.02 trillion-won average of 24 analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg. Supplying semiconductors and panels for its own devices and those from Apple Inc. and HTC Corp. helps Samsung offset slowing growth in the most-profitable segment of the $358 billion mobile-phone market. The higher capital expenditures come amid stalling demand at its television unit, the world’s biggest, and competition from Chinese brands including Huawei Technologies Co. that sell $100 handsets. “Samsung is trying to make its profit structure largely balanced,” said Lee Do Hoon, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd in Seoul. “Samsung’s smartphone margin may decline in the future but the components businesses, either chips or displays, will become a major profit driver to help it sustain the overall profit.” Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung will spend a record 24 trillion won on its businesses this year, about 1 trillion won more than last year. Shares of Samsung, which accounts for 18% of the benchmark Kospi index, fell 0.9% to 1,303,000 won today in Seoul. Falling Prices The stock slumped 13% in June, a $26 billion loss of market capitalization that is larger than rival Sony Corp., as analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley lowered their sales and profit estimates. “The strong growth streak for the smartphone market is expected to continue in the third quarter albeit at a slower pace,” Samsung said in an e-mailed statement. The average price of a smartphone has plunged to $375 from $450 since the beginning of 2012, IDC estimates.Second-quarter sales were 57.5 trillion won, compared with a preliminary estimate of about 57 trillion won given by the company July 5. Operating profit, or revenue minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose to 9.53 trillion won in the second quarter, compared with the 9.99 trillion-won average of 34 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Increasing Uncertainty’ The mobile unit, which is responsible for about two-thirds of company earnings, posted operating profit of 6.28 trillion won, up from 4.13 trillion won a year earlier. Samsung, which unveiled the S4 at New York’s Radio City Music Hall, said May 23 it sold 10 million units within the first month. The new phone features a 5-inch screen and 13-megapixel camera. Samsung also worked with rapper Jay-Z to make his new album available via an exclusive app before its official release. “The mobile business, the company’s biggest bread earner, has already peaked out in the first quarter,” said Lee Jae Yun, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co. in Seoul. “That is increasing uncertainty over the company’s overall profit growth next year.” Samsung shipped 76 million smartphones in the quarter, giving it 33.1% of the global market, compared with 31.1% a year earlier, Boston-based Strategy Analytics said today. Apple shipped 31.2 million devices for 13.6% of the market, down from 16.6%, and the Cupertino, California-based company’s lowest share in three years. New Note TongYang Securities Inc. expects Samsung to sell 27 million S4 devices in the third quarter, up from 22 million units delivered in the three months ended June, the brokerage said in a July 9 report. Samsung is planning to release its Galaxy Note 3 in the second half, is developing a handset using the Tizen operating system and is working on a wristwatch that may perform similar tasks as a smartphone. “The Galaxy Note 3 will become the ultimate driver of sales for the company along with its to-be-released ‘smart watch,’” said Greg Roh, a Seoul-based analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. “The company must focus more on customizing models and features for the different regions by figuring out their needs.” Apple (AAPL) reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts’ estimates July 23. Though profit shrank in the quarter and iPhone sales fell from a year earlier, the stronger results helped soothe investor concerns that toughening market competition and high-end market saturation would drag Apple into a prolonged slump. Chip Rebound Operating profit at Samsung’s semiconductor division surged 71% to 1.76 trillion won as chip prices rebounded on sales of mobile devices. Samsung, which supplies more than half the mobile dynamic random-access memory chips used to run smartphones, said in April it may buy the semiconductors from rival SK Hynix Inc. because of surging demand. Operating profit from the display division, which makes flat panels for TVs and mobile devices, rose 58% to 1.12 trillion won.The consumer-electronics unit, which oversees the TV and home-appliance businesses, posted operating profit of 430 billion won, down from 730 billion won a year earlier. Prices for TVs were slashed as manufacturers struggled to stay profitable amid stalling demand. Samsung had 27.9% of the flat-panel market by revenue, researcher Display Search said in June. The world’s biggest TV maker started selling 55-inch, curved sets using organic light-emitting diode technology for 15 million won in South Korea. “Growth will pick up under stronger seasonal demand although competition may intensify with launches of premium TV products,” the company said. Worldwide shipments of liquid-crystal-display TVs may total 208.8 million units this year, less than the 215.5 million projected earlier, market research firm TrendForce said in a June 13 report.

Things started off slow for Javert, but we have officially reached the tipping point. The inside joke is starting to pop up all over the Internet and like most memes, it will soon become annoying (if it hasn\\'t already).  Eventually, people started modifying and placing Javert into every situation you could possibly imagine, turning a simple reaction GIF into a meta experience.

       " '  It\\'s no time-traveling DeLorean, but the Hennessey Venom GT sure is fast. The American sports car unofficially claimed the title of world\\'s fastest production car, having reached a speed of 270.49 mph earlier this month at the Kennedy Space Center. The Hennessey Venom GT surpassed the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport\\'s previous record of 269.86 mph. See also: 2013\\'s Top Winners and Losers in Tech NASA allowed the Texas-based manufacturer Hennessey Performance Engineering to use its 3.2-mile-long space-shuttle-landing runway for the speed test, ensuring that the sports car would have enough room to accelerate. The run was made over 2.4 miles, which left the car eight-tenths of a mile to come to a stop. \"I was still pulling,\" driver Brian Smith said in\\xa0a statement. \"If we could run on an eight-mile oval, we could go faster than that. On the very top end, there was a little wandering, but hey, we\\'re going 270 mph.\" But the record isn\\'t official — at least according to Guinness World Records. Hennessey announced in 2010 that it only plans to make 29 Venom GTs (it\\'s completed 11 so far). This decision means that Guinness will not verify the run, as it requires at least 30 units to be built in order for a vehicle to qualify as a production model, according to John Hennessey, the company\\'s founder and president. Even if the Venom GT did meet these guidelines, the car would have had to make two runs in either direction to officially beat the Bugatti, Hennessey told the BBC\\'s Top Gear. NASA, however, only allowed it to make one. Bugatti\\'s record was nearly tossed aside for good last April due to claims that modifications intended to make the car go faster should disqualify it from contention. However, Guinness ultimately determined that the adjustments did not affect the Bugatti\\'s design or engine, and it was not stripped of the honor. The Venom GT, which has a base price of $1.2 million, is powered by a twin-turbocharged, v8 engine that has a horsepower of 1,244 bhp. Each car is custom-ordered, and takes six months to build.

       " '  A research team at the University of Arizona has captured the most precise images of the nights sky seen so far.  The Magellan Advanced Optics, or \"MagAO,\" is a specialized telescope filter that narrows details to .02 arcseconds — equivalent to seeing a baseball diamond on the moon. See also: Does the Future of the Space Industry Depend on Kickstarter? The improvement is thanks to a shape-shifting secondary mirror that corrects the imperfections of Earth’s atmosphere. It can do this almost in real time — 585 points on the mirror can change their positioning as fast as 1,000 times per second. This makes for the clearest visible-light images ever recorded — twice as sharp as images from the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. The mirror is placed above an existing telescope’s primary mirror on its own magnetic field and then adjusts incoming light to provide a clearer image. Astronomers used MagAO to look at the two separate stars that belong to a binary star 1,500 light years away. No previous telescope has been able to show this distinction. Astronomers are using the system on one of the twin Magellan telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. All their pictures and explanations were published in The Astrophysical Journal.

       " ' The Centers for Disease Control has confirmed that a case of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome known as MERS has been found in the United States for the first time. The disease has caused concern in Saudi Arabia, where it has killed more than 100 people since it first appeared in 2012. The outbreak there has intensified; 39 died in April. See also: 14 Robotics Breakthroughs From the Past Decade \"CDC and the Indiana State Department of Heath are conducting a joint investigation of the first case of MERS-CoV in the United States. MERS-CoV, a virus new to humans, was first reported in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012,\" the CDC wrote in a media advisory. MERS is a coronavirus, a common type of virus that includes illnesses from common colds to SARS. The CDC said MERS is passed by close contact, although it is still working to learn exactly how the virus spreads. Symptoms of MERS include fever, cough and shortness of breath, with almost all cases of the illness occurring around the Arabian Peninsula. About one third of MERS patient that display symptoms end up dying. The origin of the virus is not known for sure although a recent paper has found a connection to a similar virus found in camels. The CDC said it is conducting an active investigation, including tracking down anyone the patient may have come in contact with. They have so far found no evidence of other cases. The patient is a healthcare provider that recently came back from a trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, flying through London and then to Chicago before taking a bus to Indiana. Symptoms did not develop until the person arrived in the U.S., the CDC said. The CDC added that the patient is currently in stable condition and isolated in a hospital in Indiana, the CDC said in a call with media.  The CDC said it had been closely monitoring the spread of the disease in the Middle East and had taken precautions for its appearance in the U.S.  \"We have been preparing for this,\" said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC said it has an active investigation ongoing but has found no evidence of other cases. Schuchat added that while the CDC is taking the case seriously, the overall risk to the general public is \"very low.\" ',\n",
       " ' The toolbox of the average rebel fighting in Syria is full of things you have probably never touched: an AK-47, grenades, sniper rifle. But it also has something you might use every day: Microsoft Skype. Skype is the go-to social network for communication between rebels, anti-government activists, journalists and officials inside and outside of Syria.  Why? Skype uses wiretapping-resistant Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, making it safer for transmitting messages while under the watchful eyes and ears of government censors. It\\'s free to download and easy to use, both positives for cash-strapped rebels and activists. Its video-based chatting makes it easier to identify the person on the other line, important when verifying information as legit amidst the fog of war. And it provides an easy way for Syrians to gather electronically in areas where assembling in person poses too great a security risk. \"Skype was big in Libya, but it was just kind of emerging and the conflict was shorter,\" said Lara Setrakian, founder of Syria Deeply, the dedicated Syria news startup. \"Skype is now where you go first. And we\\'ve been invited into private chat rooms, we\\'ve had some of them translated for us in real time. That is where rebel groups are posting updates and activists inside and out are having conversations.\" Setrakian said that Syrian rebels have been smart about their Internet use in order to fly under the radar of government monitors. \"They\\'ve done a lot of savvy dodging, things like everyone using electricity at the same time of day to gate-crash censors, using satellite connections in hope those are better in terms of Internet,\" she said. \"They know in Syria that Skype itself is not compromised ... but if the government gets into your computer, it may be able to access your contact list and that would compromise your contacts.\" \"But that doesn\\'t seem to be stopping anyone,\" she added, \"and what we have found is that activists inside the country, they figure Skype is better than the phone and any other option they\\'ve had, so they\\'re willing to take that risk.\" SEE ALSO: Social Media Becoming Online Battlefield in Syria  There are some technology experts among the rebels and activists — but they\\'ve also been getting help from the outside. The U.S. State Department has been actively working to keep Syrians connected despite Internet blackouts and other obstructions, including the threat of government monitors and malware. \"The U.S. State Department has been providing a considerable amount of non-lethal assistance with a pretty significant focus on technology to the Syrian opposition,\" a U.S. government official told Mashable. He added that a part of that assistance is training on the safe use of communications technology, including Skype. \"I\\'ve read in some circles people have referred to this particular crisis as the \\'Skype Revolution\\' much as the Iranian revolution was referred to as the \\'Twitter Revolution,\\'\" said the official. \"I would say that Skype is a primary means of communication for folks within the country and for folks outside the country as well.\" In addition to training, the State Department has also been providing Syrian activists with equipment to stay connected. The equipment, which is at least partially satellite-based, was put into \"great use\" during a country-wide Internet blackout last year, according to the official. \"We equipped the activists so they can communicate where there are no government networks where there\\'s no cell phone or Internet coverage,\" said the official. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland previously told Syria Deeply that the communications equipment provided to rebels keeps them \"secure from regime tampering, from regime listening, from regime interruption.\" The official said he has attempted to work with Microsoft to add additional security measures to Skype, but said that it was \"mostly a one-way conversation.\" Microsoft did not return a request for comment for this article. Skype, for all its advantages, requires an Internet connection to work — a connection the rebels have been working hard to establish and preserve with outside help. The rebels, said the official, deserve credit for leveraging communications technologies \"often in a novel way.\" When asked about those methods, the official declined to comment for security reasons, but did say that \"most of them have to do with augmenting these networks in a certain ways that are not necessarily intended.\" \"It\\'s extremely impressive that all available technologies are being deployed by the Syrian opposition,\" said the official.

       " ' The first report of a bacterium whose genome contains man-made DNA building blocks opens the door for tailor-made organisms that could be used to produce new drugs and other products. All living creatures have a DNA \"alphabet\" of just four letters, which encode instructions for the proteins that perform most of the key jobs inside cells. But expanding that alphabet to include artificial letters could give organisms the ability to produce new proteins never seen before in nature. The man-made DNA could be used for everything from the manufacture of new drugs and vaccines to forensics,\\xa0researchers say. \"What we have done is successfully store increased information in the DNA of a living cell,\" study leader Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, told Live Science. Yet many steps remain before Romesberg and his colleagues can get cells to produce artificial proteins.  SEE ALSO: Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature  DNA alphabet The field of synthetic biology involves tinkering with DNA to create organisms capable of novel functions in medicine, energy and other areas. The DNA alphabet consists of four letters, or bases: adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine (A, T, G and C). Adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. RNA is a genetic material similar to DNA, except it has a different chemical backbone and replaces the base thymine with uracil (U). Living things translate DNA into proteins through a series of steps. First, enzymes \"transcribe\" the DNA into RNA. Then, structures called ribosomes translate the DNA into proteins, which are made up of strands of molecules called amino acids. Ultimately, the researchers aim to create organisms that can produce artificial proteins. But first, they need to show that the DNA containing the man-made letters can be transcribed into RNA, and that this RNA can be translated into proteins. In the study, Romesberg and his team created an new pair of DNA letters not found in nature and inserted the pair into cells of Escherichia coli bacteria. Getting the DNA into the cells is not easy, but the researchers were able to do it by way of a transporter, a protein that moves materials across cell membranes. Inside the cells, the man-made DNA got spliced into a plasmid, a circular piece of DNA found in bacteria. The plasmids replicated, without rejecting the foreign DNA or affecting the cells\\' growth, the researchers reported. Now that the scientists have demonstrated an organism can incorporate artificial DNA letters into its genome, the next step will be showing it can convert the DNA into new proteins, which could be used to produce better drugs. Custom-made drugs Proteins have become an important new type of drug, because cells can do the work of making them and because molecular biology techniques can be used to help proteins \"evolve\" to have desired properties, Romesberg said. But proteins are limited to only 20 building blocks, known as amino acids. \"Compare this to a medicinal chemist, who explores a much greater diversity of structures in the small-molecule drugs they synthesize,\" Romesberg said. \"We hope to be able to combine the best of both small-molecule and protein drugs.\" The research paves the way for \"designer\" organisms with custom-made genomes that are capable of performing useful tasks, like making drugs. Already, researchers have created the first \"synthetic organisms\" — artificial bacteria and yeast — which have man-made DNA sequences in their genomes. The researchers are now working on expanding the DNA alphabet of yeast cells, and eventually hope to do the same for mammalian cells, which have properties that make them better at producing protein drugs. Expanding the genetic alphabet of an entire multicellular organism such as a human wouldn\\'t be possible with the current technique, however, because the artificial letters must be directly inserted into each cell, Romesberg said.

       " ' \"We are passionate in our opinion that the world has long since exceeded its quota in the mediocrity department. We believe our professional calling is to deliver quality... For Hulu, nothing less than brain-spray awesome quality will do, down to the finest detail.\" And so begins Hulu’s genesis document, “What Defines Hulu,” a corporate manifesto of sorts from original CEO, Jason Kilar. To read it now is to look into the dreaminess of a startup adventure so earnest it breaks your heart and such a clear picture of the kind of dog-years toll a digital media company experiences in just six years. See also: How Spotify Engineered the New Music Economy Mike Hopkins, formerly of 21st Century FOX, will take over as Hulu’s CEO from interim Andy Forssell. One can only hope Hopkins has the superpower tenacity that\\'s needed to save the online streaming company we once knew and loved.   Though it poised itself as a scrappy “cord-cutting” underdog fighting the behemoth of cable, Hulu was, of course, born of the joint venture of NewsCorp and NBC to stay just slightly ahead of the curve as bit-torrenting television became increasingly user-friendly. The free Hulu service that launched in 2007 was not simply a stopgap to pad the nuisance of digital viewership; it was an elegant, intuitive, savvy alternative to watch primetime offerings.   A service this pleasurable to use and this viable an alternative was not what the parent corps had ever bargained for, but for the first several years, Hulu gained a loyal and outspoken fan base vociferous enough to launch Hulu into a new tier of service. In 2009, Hulu launched Hulu Plus, its premium subscription at $7.99 per month to offer a wider breadth of content and service on compatible mobile platforms.   \"We believe customers will respond to this neurotic focus on quality,\" says Kilar in the aforementioned document. \"We are comfortable knowing that many reasonable people will consider our standards to be too high.\" Sadly, these naysayers were slightly closer to home than Hulu’s own staff may have realized. In delivering a growing quality product, it was easy to forget that on its board were two old-school media models concerned far less about a blissful future of digital entertainment than of digital streaming never amounting to a significant threat. As relations between Hulu’s board strained, Hulu itself, the very mission statement itself—“to help people find and enjoy the world’s premium video content when, where and how they want it”—began to buckle.  Content once available to all Hulu users drifted over to the Plus service. Ad-tailor, Hulu’s unique and theoretically brilliant system for allowing users a degree of customization in their ad experience, failed to make any significant customer-facing developments in two years, resulting in bitter, entitled users who felt that coming across an ad that was not to their liking meant that Hulu was consciously ignoring their input. (This may be the time to mention that Hulu’s Ad SVP from the beginning, JP Colaco, announced his plan to leave Hulu just weeks ago.)   Hulu’s recent compatibility on the Nintendo DS platform may have drawn more attention to its delivery being literally two years late than simply letting an app on the already quaint GameBoy-style platform fizzle out quietly. Hulu\\'s former acting CEO Andy Forssell in April 2013. Image: Brad Barket/Getty Images for Hulu While Hulu actually beat Netflix to the punch in original content with charming political comedy Battleground, once the big red swung back with stunningly executed House of Cards, Hulu’s strategy took a bizarre turn: It canceled its highest-rated Hulu Original and diluted its originals with laughably low-quality offerings.   Why Timothy Levitch was resurrected from 16mm 1990s obscurity with a Hulu Original travel show that looks to have been designed by an excitable yearbook committee would ever be pitted as a remote contender against, for example, Jenji Kohen’s breathtakingly subversive Orange Is The New Black on Netflix is baffling.   Stranger still is the way in which Hulu jumped Netflix’s bandwagon of raising old shows back from the dead. In 2013, Netflix brought to life a new season of Arrested Development, a show for which fans still practically hold candlelight vigils following its sudden cancellation in 2006. Despite a tepid reception, fans went to far as to actually watch the show legally rather than pirate it.  From viewing stats during Arrested Development’s release in May of 2013 come unfathomable statements as, “Arrested Development represented 10% of all Netflix traffic on one university network in the U.S.”   The same year, Hulu took an entirely unorthodox strategy in targeting the seemingly least likely candidate for online streaming: soap opera viewers. Despite all doubts to the contrary, soap fans got it together and made the return of One Life To Live and All My Children the top-viewed content on its exclusive platforms, Hulu and iTunes.   What might have been a brilliant sneak-attack strategy to squeeze the last of soap’s dying genre ended up being perceived by many viewers as a bait-and-switch as the production company, Prospect Park, responsible for both soaps reneged on its weekday delivery schedule and reduced it instead to twice per week, leaving Hulu red-faced and with some serious explaining to soap fans, many of whom were making their maiden voyage into digital streaming and were put off from it entirely by the experience.  Hulu’s original obsession with teamwork, communication and “making it as easy as possible for builders to build and innovators to innovate” began crumbling as early as 2011 when the company decided to move its consumer advocate department, the department Kilar himself once declared the most vital, away from the company core.   It was shortly after his departure that Hulu moved headquarters altogether, declining to rejoin with its consumer advocate team. While interdepartmental camaraderie was boasted in the interior design of Hulu’s new space, Hulu’s customer-facing staff remained in a non-descript building with little to no face-to-face communication with departments able to actually enact change.   Within less than one year, Hulu’s “open, casual, interactive work environment” descended into loyalties among cable providers, networks and ad strategies designed clearly for network and advertiser’s benefit, often leaving customers with no more than a mumbled ‘sorry’ for failed promises and nonsensical content availability.  Hulu’s purchase of ad-space on non-participating networks is no accident. That understanding Hulu’s relatively new cable authentication plan requires doing basic algebra to determine availability dates is no accident. This, one can assume, is not what was meant by “delighting customers.” It’s certainly possible the sharp, drastic veering from Hulu’s original mission owes much to Providence Media Partners, a private-equity firm generally loyal to Kilar, deciding to sell its 10% stake in Hulu last year, leaving Hulu’s dreamier goals without any of Providence’s muscle to protect them. Although it was assumed in 2010 and 2011 that Hulu would go public, it never did, leaving it vulnerable to the whims of NewsCorp and Disney joint owners and the dreamers on Hulu’s board more vulnerable to large corporate bullying. Hopkins was on this very board and was around for what he admits was a tumultuous year for Hulu. No one has yet spoken to what side of the fence Hopkins has been on historically or if FOX content’s shift to the dark side of cable authentication is any indicator of things to come.   Hopefully Hopkins will be able to stand up against the board myopia that has, for a significant time now, hobbled Hulu’s success potential and return Hulu to its old reputation for “relentless pursuit of better ways.” Image: Imeh Akpanudosen/WireImage Stacey GarrattStacey Garratt is longtime veteran of new media and a former Hulu employee.

       " ' IMDb was one of those online pioneers that made the early Internet approachable. When it was founded in 1990, years before Google or Yahoo or even Bill Gates\\' \"Internet Tidal Wave” memo at Microsoft, founder Col Needham understood that people would want handy access to information about movies. Now those users are mobile — and IMDb still gets it. See also: It\\'s Season Finale Time; Here\\'s What to Binge-Watch Next IMDb\\'s movies and TV apps for iOS and Android have now been downloaded more than 100 million times, the company tells Mashable exclusively, which puts it in rarified air that includes Facebook, Instagram, Angry Birds and others still counted in the dozens. “We launched our first app in December of 2009, and here we are,” Needham, a former programmer and now IMDb\\'s ebullient CEO, told Mashable. “It’s all part of our vision to engage of our customers wherever they happen to be.” On Tuesday, those apps are getting a significant upgrade, Mashable can also reveal, with some cool new features. “The one I am personally most excited about, which I expect to use obsessively, is our new iOS \\'times\\' feature which makes it trivially easy to plan a movie outing and conveniently buy tickets based on the criteria that matter most to movie lovers,” Needham said. The \"times\" feature is based on various factors, including the time customers want to leave for the theater, when they want the movie to start or end, and the movie’s genre, MPAA rating or IMDb user rating.\\xa0Other new features include “watch” icons that help customers find which movies and TV shows can be watched immediately, and where; and \"favorite theaters,\" enabling customers to see showtimes at their preferred haunts highlighted throughout the app. These are in addition to IMDb mobile features growing in popularity like \"X-Ray,\" a throwback to IMDb\\'s original “who IS that actor?” mission. As Needham explains: “If you’re watching on a device, and somebody walks into the scene and you wonder who they are, you simply tap the screen, and up pops the head shots of everyone in view.” Tap a headshot, and voilà — you\\'re taken to that performer’s profile. Ticketing is available through a partnership with Fandango, as it has been for more than a year. IMDb\\'s 100 million downloads milestone is a testament to its evolution. It\\'s almost unheard of that over 24 years — a span that has seen the rise and fall of hundreds of sexier online brands — that this one site could defend its place as the go-to for an actor\\'s resume, a film\\'s distributor, a TV show\\'s cast or any combination of entertainment and celebrity news and information. But there\\'s a reason for that. Like parent company Amazon, IMDb likes to \"stay a couple of steps ahead\" of customers, Needham said. ',\n",
       " ' RANCHOS PALOS VERDES, Calif. — One day after Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said Netflix wants to push a huge amount of Internet traffic through the cable company\\'s pipes, but doesn\\'t want to pay for it, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings hit back — saying Comcast wants to be a monopoly that\\'s charging for access to its subscribers and \"pulling profits out of the system.\" The online video content company that accounts for roughly one-third of all Internet traffic, and one of the largest cable and Internet companies in the country are locked in a bizarre partnership battle. Netflix recently agreed to start paying Comcast for direct and better access to Comcast subscribers at, according to Roberts, a better rate than they got from other transit providers, and Netflix promptly turned around and criticized the deal it had just made. See also: The National Domination of Comcast and Time Warner in 1 Map \"We have no power,\" said Hastings. \"We had to take the deal.\" The Netflix CEO voiced his displeasure during an interview at Recode’s Code Conference.  Hastings explained that performance on Comcast was declining sharply — and that he \"reluctantly signed\" the deal with Comcast to ensure that subscribers get better access to Netflix. Since then, Netflix has signed a similar peering agreement with Verizon. When asked why they did it if the deal with Comcast was so distasteful, Hastings said, \"We do these deals and they [Verizon] say, Hey, if you’re going to pay them, then I want money, too.\" Roberts, in a separate interview with Recode editors, defended the deal. \"With [Netflix\\'s] massive volume, we want their customers to have the best experience possible.” As for Hasting\\'s complaints, \"I think it’s just business, he’s trying to get the price for free,\" said Roberts. Since both Netflix and Comcast agree that the video streaming service accounts for roughly 30% of Internet traffic, the questions really boils down to who pays for that traffic and if anyone should. \"[Comcast] says, ‘pay 30% of the costs’ and we say ‘we should get 30% of your revenue’,\" said Hastings. He added that Comcast replied, naturally, “No way.” Net neutrality  Left to right: Kara Swisher, Walt Mossberg and Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian RobertsHastings warned of a slippery slope ahead — and said that this struggle is not so much about Netflix as it is the whole Internet. Even though the Federal Communication Commission does not currently consider such transit deals a Net Neutrality issue, Hastings insists it is, but favors self-regulation, similar to how the movie industry created its own rating system, over government intervention. Comcast’s Roberts agrees, after a fashion. He told Recode\\'s Walt Mossberg that he doesn\\'t want to see the industry go back to \"100 year old regulation,\" referring to the FCC\\'s suggestion that it recategorize Internet Services as communication services — which would give the FCC more power to apply Net Neutrality regulation. “I don’t think phone regulation ever yielded great phone systems,” said Roberts. With or without regulation, Hastings worries about Comcast’s efforts to gobble up Time Warner. \"The bigger Comcast gets, the more they charge everyone else,\" said Hastings. Roberts though insisted that Comcast and Time Warner do not overlap and there would be \"no competition reduction.\" ',\n",

       " ' When India and Pakistan divided and became independent from the United Kingdom in 1947, the northern state of Kashmir immediately became a hotly contested source of conflict for the two fledgling nations.  Fast forward 67 years, and Kashmir is still a sore spot between the two countries — even when it comes to cricket.  See also: Your New Favorite Player Just Made the NBA More than 65 students, many of them Muslim, were expelled from their university, according to the Associated Press, and even briefly charged with sedition this week for rooting against India in a big match against Pakistan, The New York TImes reported Friday. The Kashmiri students attend — or used to attend — university in a different Indian state, Uttar Pradesh.  Cricket is massively popular in India. Yet in Kashmir, which is now divided between the two countries, it\\'s apparently not uncommon for Kashmiris to root against the Indian national team because of bitterness over decades of conflict.

The action against the Kashmiri students, many of whom were reported to be Muslim, comes amid what many feel is a a rising tide of Hindu nationalism in the secular, but deeply fragmented, India.  In just one example, Penguin India recently banned and destroyed existing copies of a book on Hindu history following a long legal battle. The book by a University of Chicago professor was criticized by litigators for hurting \"the religious feelings of millions of Hindus by declaring that [religious poem] Ramayana is a fiction.\" According to the Times, the Kashmiri cricket-fan students were punished so harshly after pressure from leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a conservative Hindu nationalist group many observers think will dominate India\\'s national elections that begin April 7.

       " ' You might say you\\'re looking for a potential mate that looks like George Clooney or Scarlett Johansson, but chances are you do have a \"type\" and it looks a lot like your ex. Building on this concept, popular dating site Match.com has partnered with Los Angeles-based matchmaking service Three Day Rule that uses facial-recognition technology to find dates for users. In the weeks ahead, Match.com members will be able to upgrade to Three Day Rule\\'s premium service, which asks users to send pictures of exes to determine the type of look they\\'re attracted to.  See also: How Online Dating Sites Use Data to Find \\'The One\\' \"People have a type and it\\'s not necessarily about height or race or hair color, but a lot of it is about face shape,\" Talia Goldstein, the founder of Three Day Rule, told Mashable. But the option comes with a price: Three Day Rule\\'s premium service costs $5,000 for a six-month package. This user base is typically a small demographic of high-end clients who don\\'t have time to find dates. Premium members are assigned professional matchmakers, who coach the client, meet with them, get to know their preferences and even go on pre-dates with potential mates as to not waste the member\\'s time. (The matches come directly from both Match and Three Day Rule\\'s database or the matchmaker\\'s personal network.) Now, the matchmakers will ask for pictures of premium member\\'s ex-girlfriends or boyfriends to gauge the face shape its clients like most from those databases and networks. \"I\\'ve noticed over my years in matchmaking that people have types,\" Goldstein said. \"I always ask my clients to send me photos of their exes. They say that they don\\'t have a type, but when I see the photos, to me they look very similar. The ex\\'s may be different ethnicities, or have different hair color, but their facial structures are the same.\" Facial structure will be factored in to what matchmakers are looking for to pair up their clients, in addition to personality and interests.

       " ' As of Tuesday Twitter became a wannabe Facebook. Not just in the sense that its new image-filled feed looks a lot like the social network\\'s timeline. No, it\\'s that Twitter is becoming a restless innovator, piling on change after change, moving fast and breaking things.  The difference between the social services is that Facebook restlessly innovates because that\\'s the way it is: a company of hackers. It is profitable, has more than a billion users, and has nothing to prove. Twitter, however, is betraying more than a hint of desperation. Its user growth is behind schedule. It still isn\\'t profitable, and it has an $11 billion IPO coming up.  See also: Twitter Now Fills Your Feed With Photos Evidently a decision has been made at the highest levels that Twitter needs to be more accessible to a wider audience — and apparently that means stuffing itself with videos (that Vine acquisition needed to pay more dividends), what will effectively become in-line display ads, and all kinds of other visual noise.  It\\'s as if a vineyard was trying to be more accessible by filling wine bottles with beer.   In the past 20 mins, I\\'ve had a bare ass, a penis and shirtless Burt Reynolds on a bearskin rug show up on my TL. Web client is now useless — Kim (@kkjordan) October 29, 2013  Twitter at least gave its app users the option to turn off the new in-line images. Anyone who goes to Twitter.com won\\'t have the same option. Which is particularly irksome, because the web client is where some of Twitter\\'s most loyal users go. Our numbers are legion: For all the talk of mobile first, Twitter.com still has 190 million unique visitors a month.  We\\'re the ones who don\\'t want the hassle of a separate desktop client. We don\\'t like the busyness of Tweetdeck, with its self-updating feeds. We simply want a tab open in our browsers, dense with information-rich tweets. If we wanted in-line pictures, all we had to do was click on them.  We were also perfectly happy with reverse-chronological tweets. If we missed out on the first part of a conversation, again, all we needed to do was click on a tweet to see it all in order. We didn\\'t need those blue lines to hold our hands.  In short, Twitter just solved two problems that weren\\'t actually problems. A massive repair effort is underway on something that, for hundreds of millions of people, wasn\\'t broken.   The amount of visible ads in my twitter timeline is directly inverse to the amount of times I want to look at said timeline. — Sean BONES (@seanbonner) October 29, 2013  We\\'ve seen this movie before. I remember a conversation with a senior executive at Friendster, right after that social network decided to ban users who didn\\'t use headshots or proper names in their profiles. I pointed out that annoying loyal customers who were trying to be a bit whimsical was no way to grow a company. He argued that the reward of more mainstream users was worth losing the hardcore audience for.  Friendster had the early adopter advantage. It could have been Facebook. In the end it was sold, and is now a social gaming platform in Malaysia. Another company that tried to redesign itself to be more Facebook-like: Digg. It lost 26% of its traffic at a stroke, as users migrated en masse to Reddit.  A Tale of Two Twitters Rather than thrust a redesign down users\\' throats, it might be better — and less risky — if Twitter were to offer two options for website users.  One could be the visually-rich, blue line-covered and video-filled version we\\'re looking at today. You could host it at visual.twitter.com. Meanwhile, those of us who prefer an old-fashioned news feed (the majority of us, at least according to snap poll at the bottom of this story) could go over to text.twitter.com.  In the software engineering world, this kind of split, where the same code goes in two radically different directions, is called \"forking.\" And so I mean it in the nicest possible way when I say: Twitter, please fork yourself.

See also: 11 Shocking Google Earth Before-and-After Photos Officials in Saxony, a state in Eastern Germany, have tested 752 wild boars since 2012 and found 297 contained unsafe levels of radioactivity. The legal radiation limit for human consumption is 600 becquerels per kilogram, and some boars registered radiation of more than 9,800 becquerels per kilogram, Quartz reported. That's more than 15 times the legal limit.  The radioactivity is thought to originate from the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, located nearly 700 miles away. In 1986, a nuclear explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine released radioactive particles into the atmosphere, contaminating air and soil across Europe.  Wild boar are hunted and consumed as a delicacy in Germany. Experts say the animal is particularly prone to radiation exposure due to its diet of mushrooms and other underground fungi, which are deeply impacted by soil contamination. The radioactive boar problem comes at a major expense for Germany, as the government compensates hunters for the cost of disposing animals that are unfit to eat. The policy cost the country $555,000 in 2009 alone, according to Quartz. According to The Telegraph's report, at current contamination levels the problem could persist for another 50 years at least.  \",\n",

       " ' Uber has hit another speed bump. Portland, Oregon, has filed a lawsuit against the car service company, citing public safety concerns. Uber had just launched its service in the city on Friday. See also: Despite controversy, Uber goes big with hip promos The company had been in discussions with officials about operating in the city for several months, but Uber launched apparently without reaching an agreement. Portland\\'s transportation director Leah Treat issued a cease and desist order Monday, directing all drivers to stop taking rides until the company is in compliance with city regulations. \"Our main concern is public health and safety, because the state invested in the cities the responsibility to do that,\" Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said in a statement. \"Beyond that, though, is the issue of fairness. Taxi cab companies follow rules on public health and safety. So do hotels and restaurants and construction companies and scores of other service providers. Because everyone agrees: good regulations make for a safer community. Uber disagrees, so we\\'re seeking a court injunction.\" “If Uber thinks there should be no maximum price on what they charge Portlanders, they should make their case to the Portland City Council,” City commissioner Steve Novick said.  “If Uber thinks taxi companies shouldn’t have to serve people with disabilities, they should make their case. If Uber thinks taxis should not have to have proper insurance in case of a crash, they should tell us why we should allow that.” Uber also issued a statement, but did not address whether or not it would cease operations. The company said that it had received a \"warm welcome\" from both riders and drivers since launching Dec. 5. The lawsuit lists several regulations with which the city contends Uber is not in compliance. If drivers are found to be taking rides, the city is threatening fines of $1,500 for Uber and $2,250 for the driver for the first offense. Additional violations can be fined up to $5,000. Last month, Uber suspended operations in Nevada after a court filed an injunction against the company. The Nevada attorney general had filed a lawsuit in October. A petition launched by Uber garnered more than 9,000 signatures in support of operating in Portland. Those signatures are not necessarily city residents, however.

       " \"  Scientists have discovered vast water reserves near Earth’s mantle, a finding that could reshape our understanding of where Earth’s water came from. According to a new study by a group of U.S. geophysicists, a reservoir of water three times the volume of all of Earth’s oceans has been discovered inside a layer of blue rock 440 miles deep.  See also: Google Maps Dives Into World Oceans for Underwater Street Views Geophysicist Steve Jacobsen of Northwestern University, who coauthored the study, says it’s evidence the planet’s water bubbled up from somewhere underground. The water is thought to be trapped in a layer of ringwoodite, a rock with a crystalline structure that acts like a sponge, to attract and trap the hydrogen and oxygen atoms that comprise water.  While the presence of this layer of ringwoodite hasn't be confirmed, there is mounting evidence that it exists. A chunk of diamond carried to Earth’s surface in a volcano earlier this year had a piece of ringwoodite inside. Scientists used 2,000 seismometers to track the vibrations generated by earthquakes across the planet. The waves appeared to be propagating through saturated rock, rather than dry material, which gave scientists an idea of the size of the reservoir. The scientists are trying to find out whether this reservoir layer extends around the whole planet. In the meantime, the results of the study thus far have been published in the journal Science. \",\n",

See also: 7 U.S. Cities Where Minority-Owned Businesses Are Thriving A college dropout, Ellison founded the company that would become Oracle in 1977 and had served as CEO since then. The company now has a market capitalization of $182 billion.   The final Larry Ellison scorecard: Oracle stock is up 89,640% since he took the company public in March 1986. — Dennis K. Berman (@dkberman) September 18, 2014  Ellison is not leaving Oracle entirely, instead staying on as the company\\'s chief technical officer. In that role he will oversee the core of Oracle\\'s business, including \"all software and hardware engineering functions,\" according to a press release announcing the move. He downplayed the change during Thursday\\'s earnings call. \"I\\'m going to continue doing what I\\'ve been doing over the last several years. They\\'re going to continue what they\\'ve been doing over the last several years,\" Ellison said about the change in titles. Oracle shares dropped in after-hours trading following the news, trading 2.3% lower. Ellison, who turned 70 in August, is the fifth richest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of around $48 billion. He has gained notoriety for spending his wealth in lavish ways including exotic cars, racing yachts and a Hawaiian Island that reportedly cost between $500 million and $600 million. The news generated no shortage of reactions from those in the tech community that had come to know Ellison.  Congratulations to my longtime hero & sparring partner Larry Ellison on phenomenal nearly-40-year run at Oracle—one of best founders ever. — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 18, 2014  Mark Hurd, who had been president, and Safra Catz, who served as chief financial officer, will share the role of CEO.  \"Safra and Mark will now report to the Oracle Board rather than to me,\" Ellison said in the press release. \"All the other reporting relationships will remain unchanged. The three of us have been working well together for the last several years, and we plan to continue working together for the foreseeable future. Keeping this management team in place has always been a top priority of mine.\" Hurd is a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard who had been noted for aggressively cutting costs. He resigned from the company after an internal investigation discovered that he had violated company policy by spending his expenses on a woman who later made a sexual harassment claim against him. Catz has worked at Oracle since 1999 and sits on its board of directors. She had reportedly been the highest-paid CFO of 2013 with a total compensation package of $43.6 million.

       " ' Remember the Comcast customer service phone call that went viral this summer, where a representative of the cable giant aggressively stonewalled a canceling customer? So does Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. \"I was embarrassed and disappointed when I heard it,\" Roberts told Mashable during a Q&A with reporters in San Francisco Wednesday. \"But then my wife said, \\'We\\'re going to be a better company for it.\\' It was a teachable moment for employees.\" Roberts, who took over Comcast from his father in 2002, still insists that the call represented a minority of customer experiences — \"When you have 250 million phone calls a year,\" he said, \"you\\'re going to have mistakes.\" But at the same time, he deputized executive Charlie Herrin as the new \"head of customer experience.\"  See also: Calling Comcast Customer Service? You Should Probably Record It. What that means isn\\'t clear yet. But Herrin previously headed up the team that designed the X1 cable box platform Roberts was in town to demonstrate to press and analysts, and Roberts promised that the change would be along those lines. \"We can revolutionize our customer experience,\" he said, the way that the cable box was revolutionized. The X1 cable box remote includes a voice recognition microphone that allows you to instantly see all available episodes of a single show, for example. You can also recieve recommendations on what you should watch now simply by asking your request out loud. It also lets family and friends send you messages or share what they\\'re watching on your screen, and means that customer support can control your box remotely on a service call. Roberts called the technology an \"aha game-changing moment\" for customers.  Roberts also spoke at length about the competitive landscape. He insisted Comcast had no doubts or second thoughts on its proposed buyout of Time Warner, and insisted such a merger would be good for innovation since it would allow Comcast to roll out changes across the U.S. at the same time.  \"If we want to partner with Google, for example,\" he said, \"it would be nice to have more of a national footprint.\"  As for the net neutrality controversy, which President Barack Obama waded into on Monday by demanding that the Federal Communications Commission more closely regulate Internet providers, Roberts claimed Comcast had been misunderstood. \"It\\'s so easy to say \\'You\\'re going to give someone a fast lane,\\'\" he said. \"That\\'s not what we\\'re going to do.\" All Internet traffic was treated equally on Comcast servers, he insisted.

       " ' Imagine if instead of swinging a white cane, a visually impaired person could wear clothing that senses things in the environment and relays that information through touch. That\\'s the dream of a team of scientists and engineers at a company called Tactile Navigation Tools, which is developing a vest embedded with sensors that can detect objects or people nearby and convert the signals into vibrations felt by the body. SEE ALSO: Bionic humans: top 10 technologies The device, known as Eyeronman, was on display Nov. 6-8 at the New York Festival of Light, an event that featured lighting art installations in Brooklyn\\'s Dumbo neighborhood.  \"I want to build a tool that can actually get [visually impaired] people to walk around crowded environments\" without assistance, said Dr. J.R. Rizzo, a rehabilitation doctor at NYU Langone Medical Center and the founder and chief medical adviser of Tactile Navigation Tools. Eyeronman demo At the event, I got to try on a prototype of the vibrating vest, which was sprouting wires and electronics and looked a bit like something out of a mad science lab. They also had a T-shirt equipped with sensors that would light up LEDs on the front of the vest (as a stand-in for the vibrating devices) when a person or object moved in front of them. Ultimately, the sensors and the vibrating devices will be combined in a single piece of clothing, the team said.  Detail of the prototype unveiled in New York in early November. Image:  Tactile Navigation ToolsI also got to try on a pair of vibrating glasses, called iGlasses, made by the Canadian company AmbuTech. The eyewear contains an ultrasound sensor that causes the frames to vibrate when objects are detected in the wearer\\'s path. The Eyeronman vest is built on the same concept as the iGlasses, but will provide much more detailed information because it has many more sensors and vibrators, Rizzo told Live Science. Rizzo himself is legally blind due to a condition known as choroideremia, a rare retinal degenerative disease that causes progressive vision loss. The device could be used not only by the blind, but also by law enforcement, rescue workers and others who work in visually obscured environments. 3D sensing The vest will have different types of sensors, including lidar, a laser-based system used in driverless cars; ultrasound, a type of high-pitched sound used by bats and other animals forecholocation; and infrared, a type of electromagnetic radiation used by some animals to detect body heat from their prey. When the sensors detect an object, their signals will be converted into vibrations in a corresponding part of the vest. For example, when the vest senses a dog in the wearer\\'s lower left field of view, vibrators on the lower left part of the vest (as viewed by the wearer) will activate. The device will represent a third dimension (depth) using the frequency of vibration. In the same example, if the dog were running toward the person in the vest, the garment would buzz faster and faster. The device is designed to be intuitive, but the brain still needs to be trained to interpret the vibrations, Rizzo said. However, he said he suspects that \"as someone gets used to the vibrations and what they mean, it\\'s going to become hardwired [in the brain], until the person doesn\\'t have to consciously think about it.\" Tactile Navigation Tools is developing two different versions of the vest. One version could be worn over a thin shirt in summer; the other splits into two parts, with the sensors worn on the outside of a jacket and the vibrators worn on the inside. The company aims to have a commercially available product by the end of 2015 or the beginning of 2016, Rizzo said.

       " ' [Update: The pen is now officially on Kickstarter] Humans are accustomed to drawing in the air. We gesture with our hands when talking and will try to illustrate charade secrets by \"drawing\" objects in space. 3D-printing pens takes those gestures, makes them tangible and, in the hands of an artists, beautiful. Recent 3D-printing pens have been cool, but clunky affairs. LIX Pen, however, is something different. It\\'s light, small and apparently needs no more power than you can draw from your run-of-the-mill laptop. Now it\\'s coming to Kickstarter. Believe it or not, someone at LIX drew this figure with a 3D-printing pen.Image:  LIX  Measuring 6.45 inches long, 0.55 inch in diameter and weighing just 1.23 ounces, the aluminum 3D-printing pen (which also comes in black) really is pen sized.  You hold it just like a pen, and plug a 3.5mm-like jack into the base and the other end of your cable into your computer. The juice allows LIX to heat to over 300-degrees Fahrenheit, though the plant-based PLA filament (it can also use the stronger ABS plastic) only needs to heat to 180-degrees to work. That filament is fed in through a hole in the base and emerges as a super-heated liquid on the tip so you can start doodling in the air. Not sure these 3D-pen-printed designs are usable, but they are pretty to look at.Image:  LIX  Unlike 3D printers, there is no program guiding the printing tip. Instead, to create 3D objects, you simply start drawing in the air with the LIX Pen, moving slowly as the melted filament draws out. It cools quickly so that your structure remains rigid. Each filament rod is about 10 centimeters long and should, according to the company, last for about two minutes of air-drawing. See also: Inside Shapeways\\' New 3D Printing Facility [PHOTOS] 3D pen printing works for everything from abstract sculpture to fine art and jewelry to T-shirt design. The only limit, it appears, is your skill level and ability to hold and move the pen very, very steadily.  LIX co-founder Anton Suvorov, told Mashable the company\\'s 3D-printing pen \"has no concurrence on the market,\" and it should arrive in Kickstarter sometime around April 14, where the company will be taking pre-orders. The starting price, at least for the campaign, will be $139.95. LIX also sells, for $59.95, a ballpoint pen replica of LIX that is nothing more than a regular pen, but why would anyone want that?

Preliminary data puts it as a 4.4 magnitude earthquake on the Richter Scale, which would be enough to cause mild to moderate shaking, with an epicenter of six miles northwest of Westwood and Beverly Hills, Calif., at 6:26 a.m. PT. The quake had been rated as a 4.7 magnitude earthquake on the Richter Scale but then downgraded upon further analysis. (It is possible that this strength estimate will be revised again as scientists examine the data.)

       " ' Everybody\\'s favorite photo-sharing (and photo-disappearing) app just got a slick makeover in the App Store. Snapchat rolled out version 5.0, dubbed \"Banquo,\" on Wednesday for iPhones. It boasts a slew of speed and design enhancements, including swipe navigation, double-tap to reply, an improved friend finder and in-app profiles. SEE ALSO: Want Those Snapchats Back? That\\'ll Be $300   The revamped design has shed its blue coat (seen above) and now dons a more transparent look that features a full-screen view. To get from your list of snaps to camera mode to the beefed-up search page, simply swipe to the side. From your inbox, double-tapping speeds up the transition from self-destructing to snapping, and the new in-app profiles include score counts and best friends (without links to Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr). For the time being, Android users will have to sit tight, as the improvements are not yet available in Google Play. But for iPhone users, Banquo is ready for action. Of course, not everyone is pleased with the update. The ghost mascot, as one customer review has sadly noted, is now faceless. And another user has qualms with the \"best friends\" list. What do you think about Snapchat\\'s updates? Let us know in the comments below. Mashable composite, image via iStockphoto, jenyk; logo courtesy of Snapchat ',\n",

       " ' Super Bowl ads are like a miniature version of the film industry. There\\'s (relatively) huge money at stake and the creators are torn between creating something new and noteworthy or falling back on established formulas. Ads in the Super Bowl don\\'t usually have sequels, but they do have imitators.  If Doritos lit up USAToday\\'s AdTrack the year before with a flatulent animal, then you can bet that the finest minds at Anheuser-Busch are burning calories late into the night figuring out how to get a laugh doing the same. If an ad agency scored by exhuming a decades-old entertainment property to resonate with aging Gen Xers, then one of their rivals probably quickly combed through IMDB seeking something similar.  See also: A Sneak Peek at Sunday\\'s Super Bowl Ads For viewers at home, here\\'s a guide to the seven tried-and-true formulas that you will more than likely see in this year\\'s game.  1. The Second Run This ad behaves as if it is a continuation of a movie or a TV show. The gold standard is Honda\\'s 2012 \"Ferris Bueller\" ad, which showed Ferris (Matthew Broderick) coping with middle age. Others include a 1999 Apple ad that imagined 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s evil computer HAL envying Macs for their Y2K-compliance.   In 2010, Coca-Cola also imagined a new episode of The Simpsons in which Mr. Burns has lost his fortune and a sympathetic Apu gives him a Coke. The use of the Second Run is so common that when word spread that there was a Seinfeld reunion in the works, many falsely assumed it was for a Super Bowl ad.  This year\\'s examples: Oikos\\' Full House ad and Kia\\'s Matrix ad.  2. The Cameo, Ironic and Otherwise Like Hollywood, Super Bowl advertisers often rely on star power to get their point across. While some do straight-up endorsements, like this year\\'s rejected SodaStream ad with Scarlett Johansson, often the stars show up out of context. Some famous examples include Snickers\\' 2010 Super Bowl ad, which featured Betty White and Abe Vigoda playing a rough-and-tumble game of tackle football, and schmaltz jazz star Kenny G in a 2011 Audi ad.  This year\\'s examples: Arnold Schwartzenegger for Bud Light, Sarah McLaughlin for Audi, Ben Kingsley for Jaguar, Sean Astin for CarMax, Tim Tebow for T-Mobile. 3. The Timeline Here the advertiser takes on a trip back in time to emphasize the brand\\'s venerability. In 2012, for instance, Budweiser harkened back to the exultant moment in 1933, when the U.S. repealed Prohibition:  Pepsi\\'s 2002 ad with Britney Spears also took this approach, as did the NFL itself in 2012. Britney Spears Superbowl Pepsi [2002] by House-of-Britney This year\\'s examples: Pepsi\\'s \"There Since the First.\"  4. The Really Smart Pet (or Child) A mainstay of Doritos ads, \"the Really Smart Pet outwits his owner\" usually to gets to the heart of the product being advertised. In 2012, for example, a rescue dog in a Bud Light ad showed a flair for fetching the beer from the fridge:  Babies are frequently subbed for pets. In fact, the talking baby has become a mainstay of many Super Bowls. The most famous example is E*Trade\\'s talkative toddler. This Doritos ad (see below) from the same year shows a clever baby joining forces with Grandma to grab Doritos from a bratty brother:  This year\\'s examples: In another potential Dorito\\'s ad this year (the brand hasn\\'t announced a finalist in its Crash the Super Bowl contest yet), a little girl rides a dog like a horse and lassoes up some Doritos. 5. This Product is So Good it Makes People Crazy Another Doritos favorite, the idea here is that the average person is so obsessed with this awesome product that he (again, it\\'s usually a guy) is driven insane. Other brands that have used this approach include Taco Bell, whose 2013 Super Bowl ad featured elderly people acting like teenagers when they eat the chain\\'s food:  In last year\\'s Crash the Super Bowl winner, a man also incurs the wrath of his pet goat, all for the love of Doritos:  This year\\'s examples: In another Doritos spot, a man brazenly and unconvincingly lies to his boss about stealing the office\\'s Doritos.  6. \"Sex Sells\" It wouldn\\'t be the Super Bowl if there wasn\\'t a spot that caused at least half the room to sit there in slack-jawed amazement. GoDaddy, of course, used to be a big adherent of this type of ad, but has now switched gears. In recent years, Fiat has used beautiful women as a metaphor for its vehicles as well:   This year\\'s example: H&M\\'s David Beckham ad.  7. The Serious Moment While everyone\\'s trying to get a laugh in at the Super Bowl, an effective strategy can be to zig when others zag and offer a Serious Moment that will shut everyone in the room up. Chrysler excelled with this approach in recent years with its Clint Eastwood-narrated \"It\\'s Halftime\" ad:  Dodge also won a lot of praise for its Ram Trucks \"Farmers\" ad from last year:  This year\\'s example: Budweiser\\'s spot, which features a veteran\\'s homecoming.  8. Aww. It\\'s a Puppy When all else fails, bring out the cute animals. Budweiser has excelled at this. Last year, the brand\\'s ad featuring a baby Clydesdale was one of the game\\'s most popular: This year\\'s example: Lesson learned. Bud is back this year with another very popular ad featuring a puppy and the Clydesales who love him.

Budweiser: 9/11 Tribute (2002)  Only airing once, so as not to benefit the company financially, this ad by Budweiser paid tribute to the victims of Sept. 11.

       " ' LOS ANGELES — Terminator: Genisys is having another rough Judgment Day. For all we know, the reboot of the reboot will blow minds (and SkyNet servers) when it hits theaters July 1. But in this rush-to-judgment climate, where movies are picked apart for months before anyone sees so much as a teaser trailer, the Internet more or less thinks Terminator: Genisys just plain blows. SEE ALSO: \\'Terminator: Genisys\\' Is the New Movie Title You\\'ll Have to Look Up Every Time Entertainment Weekly released the first official images from the film on Wednesday, and the onslaught began.

They look like post-nuke Wreck-It-Ralph & Vanellope. — Bob Chipman (@the_moviebob) October 29, 2014  OK, so the photos didn\\'t play well. But EW had a bunch of plot details in its exclusive — maybe that would save the day? For instance, Sarah Connor (Clarke) has had a story makeover, which EW describes thusly: [Sarah Connor] was orphaned by a Terminator at age 9. Since then, she’s been raised by (brace yourself) Schwarzenegger’s Terminator—an older T-800 she calls “Pops”—who is programmed to guard rather than to kill. As a result, Sarah is a highly trained antisocial recluse who’s great with a sniper rifle but not so skilled at the nuances of human emotion.  Story details from TERMINATOR: GENISYS sound like fan fiction. Not excited about that flick at all. — Ethan Anderton (@Ethan_Anderton) October 29, 2014   I wrote up some thoughts on TERMINATOR: GENISYS, which looks and sounds like a SNL sketch. http://t.co/DKeRtgsaDb — Peter S.

I can\\'t even muster the energy to read about it. #deadhorse — Adrian Askarieh (@AdrianAskarieh) October 29, 2014   It\\'s actually depressing how low my enthusiasm is for this new TERMINATOR pic. I WANT to love GENISYS (ugh) but today\\'s PR doesn\\'t excite me — Jeff Sneider (@TheInSneider) October 29, 2014   SARAH CONNOR DOES NOT CALL THE TERMINATOR \"POPS\" — Meredith Woerner (@MdellW) October 29, 2014  Ohhhhkay then.  The good news is, the folks behind Terminator: Genisys should be used to the abuse by now: Back in August, Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is reprising his role as \"pops\" — err, the T-800) announced via Instagram that the title would be changed from Terminator: Genesis to that weird, corporatized spelling we have now. The crowd didn\\'t exactly go wild for that one, either. The film has had other PR hiccups along the way, with casting in particular: Though Clarke is on Game of Thrones and Smith is probably the most popular Doctor Who going, they\\'re simply not movie stars. Jason Clarke is a fantastic actor who carried the first third of Zero Dark Thirty, but he\\'s done nothing so far to suggest he can carry a film as a leading man. Schwarzenegger has become a punchline.  And Jai Courtney? The guy riding on the back of Clarke\\'s motorcycle and squinting more like he\\'s sitting on a commode? The first-response commenters on the EW story were ... not kind.  A screenshot from EW.com.Terminator: Genisys has had a long, hard road just to get this far. The rights to the Terminator franchise have bounced around quite a bit after the company that got Terminator: Salvation made went belly up. Paramount Pictures is distributing this version of the film, which Game of Thrones and Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor is tackling. And here\\'s the thing: Shooting just wrapped in August. No trailers have been cut. No one who\\'s snarking has read the full script. For all we know, Terminator: Genisys will be a huge, pleasant surprise. Maybe movie careers will be forged. Maybe Hollywood It-producer Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and Tinseltown tastemaker who\\'s backing Genisys as an executive producer, can work her magic yet again. Maybe this will be the movie that shows us, once and for all, that sniping at first-looks and teasers and sizzles is a fool\\'s errand. Or maybe it\\'s just this ...  I wonder if anybody at TERMINATOR: GENISYS HQ is reading the internet and rocking back and forth slowly, head in hands. — Devil Faraci (@devincf) October 29, 2014        window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

That comes on Saturday, when the tournament\\'s two Final Four games tip off, and on Monday night, when we get the 2014 national championship game.  But who should you watch? How should you watch? Who has the best chance to win? Read on to get up to speed on broadcast information and fun-filled team previews quicker than a Shabazz Napier crossover dribble.  See also: March Madness Coaches Feel All of the Things Some Final Four basics Top overall seed Florida and seven-seed Connecticut get things started on Saturday at 6:09 p.m. ET. Then two-seed Wisconsin takes on eight-seed Kentucky on the same floor inside northern Texas\\' massive AT&T Stadium. That game is scheduled to tip at 8:49 p.m. ET, but could be pushed back if the first one runs long. Since the games are on cable, you can\\'t watch online unless you login with cable subscriber info (here\\'s how to watch online). March Madness broadcast partners CBS and Turner also have something new and special planned for this year\\'s Final Four: team-specific broadcasts. This means you can tune into TNT or truTV during each game to get an alternate feed featuring intentionally slanted announcers calling the action.  During the first game, TNT will carry Florida\\'s \"teamcast,\" while truTV carries the UConn version. During the second game, TNT will carry the Kentucky slant, while truTV carries the Wisconsin version. Sports Illustrated\\'s Richard Deitsch has more information here.

Connecticut  Connecticut coach Kevin Ollie shouts instructions during the first half of a March Madness game against Iowa State on March 28, 2014.Image: Frank Franklin II/Associated PressRoad to the Final Four: The Huskies finished the regular season with an overall record of 24-8, earning them a seven-seed in the tournament. Then they got hot and went on a major upset streak, taking out 10-seed St. Joseph\\'s, then two-seed Villanova, then three-seed Iowa State and finally four-seed Michigan State to reach the Final Four. (One gambler rode some of that hot streak to $390,000 in winnings.) Why to root for UConn: Come on, man — they\\'re the underdogs! Technically, Kentucky may have had a slightly worse seeding heading into March Madness, but Kentucky also has the most highly touted freshman class of all time, so the Huskies are the real — no pun intended — underdog squad here.  If that\\'s not enough, UConn\\'s 41-year-old coach Kevin Ollie (above) played under legendary UConn coach Jim Calhoun in the early \\'90s and has emerged from his mentor\\'s shadow this season, just his second at the helm of the Huskies program.  If that\\'s not enough, guard Shabazz Napier is well on his way to lifetime hero status in the entire Northeast. The small, speedy guard is averaging better than 23 points per game in the tournament and fought through a bloodied nose to lead last weekend\\'s shocking win over Michigan State.  Why this might end in tears: Napier might reach the end of his bag of tricks. Ollie might get outsmarted by a more veteran coach on the biggest stage. This collection of players was never supposed to get this far. There are any number of reasons the wheels could all fall off for UConn this weekend — which, in a way, is all the more reason to hope they don\\'t. The player you have to watch: Napier is the only possible choice here. He\\'s a warrior and supremely entertaining. He deflects comparisons to Kemba Walker, who led a magical UConn title run in 2011, but those comparisons are becoming pretty impossible to avoid. Here are some Napier highlights.   Florida  Florida guard Scottie Wilbekin (5) celebrates a basket against Dayton in their NCAA tournament game on March 29, 2014.Image: John Bazemore/Associated PressRoad to the Final Four: Florida was the tournament\\'s top overall seed, so was kind of expected to reach this point. In doing so, they knocked off 16-seed Albany, nine-seed Pittsburgh, four-seed UCLA and 11-seed Dayton.  Why to root for Florida: Let\\'s see, a truly cohesive team that blends freshman talent with veteran leaders and players who have overcome personal hardships, led by a veteran coach who\\'s been at the same school for nearly 20 years — what\\'s not to love? One could argue that this is exactly how bigtime college basketball is supposed to look.  Why this might end in tears: The Gators are Final Four favorites, and the pressure might get to them. They\\'re also overdue for a loss; they haven\\'t been defeated since a gutty guard made a buzzer-beating shot to take them down back on Dec. 2. Wait a minute. That guard\\'s name was Shabazz Napier and that team was Connecticut. Uh-oh — could we see a repeat of something like this?   The player you have to watch: Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin is Florida\\'s best player, the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year the Gators\\' clear-cut leader. But he nearly didn\\'t even suit up for the team this year. In June, Donovan suspended him from the team indefinitely and encouraged him to transfer. Wilbekin was only able to stick around after he \"begged Donovan to allow him to stay and to work his way back to the team,\"  the New York Times reports. One Final Four run later, and that seems to be a good call by both parties.  Kentucky  Kentucky\\'s Julius Randle goes up for a shot against Georgia on March 15, 2014.Image: John Bazemore/Associated PressRoad to the Final Four: The Wildcats have had quite a journey. Their six-man freshman class was touted as the best of all time before the season. But when they struggled early, they were written off as overhyped and emblematic of everything wrong with modern college hoops. Now, they\\'re peaking at just the the right time. They boast March Madness wins over nine-seed Kansas State, one-seed Wichita State, four-seed Louisville and two-seed Michigan to earn their Final Four berth.  Why to root for Kentucky: There\\'s something perfect about the storyline we mentioned — six teenagers judged and torn apart by adults for an entire season, who come together at just the right moment to prove all the doubters wrong. Plus, Kentucky has some of college hoops\\' wildest fans. They can get ugly when the Wildcats lose, but here\\'s someone\\'s unsolicited contribution to coach John Calipari\\'s front year earlier this week:   Some guy just stopped at Cal\\'s house, got out and put this in his yard.#crazy pic.twitter.com/nxHmbHuRl3 — Fred Foltz (@ukturkeyhunter) April 1, 2014  Why this might end in tears: Those freshman are young, after all, and thats\\' something that could still catch up to them — especially if they run into an experienced Florida squad in the national title game.  The player you have to watch: Freshman power forward Julius Randle is 6\\'9\" and 250 pounds of pure beast. His skill, strength and passion under the hoop are a pleasure to watch. This year\\'s Final Four location means he\\'s returning home to the Dallas area for what will almost certainly be his final collegiate games before leaving school early to enter the NBA Draft.  Wisconsin  Wisconsin forward Sam Dekker (15) celebrates during the second half of a third-round game against the Oregon in the NCAA college basketball tournament Saturday, March 22, 2014, in Milwaukee.Image: Morry Gash/Associated PressRoad to the Final Four: The two-seed Badgers took down 15-seed American, seven-seed Oregon, six-seed Baylor and top seed Arizona to get to this point.  Why to root for Wisconsin: Teamwork. Help defense. The two-handed chest pass. The triple-threat stance. Picture-perfect jump-shots. Floor burns. Make no mistake — these Badgers have real talent. But if your dear old granddad just hates the way young whippersnappers play the game today, Wisconsin is the Final Four team with the best shot of convincing him that good basketball still exists.  Why this might end in tears: If the Kentucky athletes get in a rhythm, or if Florida starts clicking on all-cylinders, or if Shabazz Napier goes on full Kemba Walker mode, then the Badgers just might not have the players to stick around. They\\'re certainly the least sexy pick here, but then again, they\\'re probably the most likely team to formulate a baller game plan then execute it to perfection.  The player you have to watch: Sam Dekker is Wisconsin\\'s high flyer, but 6\\'11\" center Frank Kaminsky is our player to watch. He has a great shot out to three-point territory, and is tough and crafty under the basket, helping him make up for less-than-ideal athleticism.  He went for 28 points and 11 rebounds to help beat Arizona for a final berth last weekend, and may have even him earned himself a look from NBA teams. Here are highlights of Kaminsky going off for 43 points in a game earlier this year.   3 reasonable (but probably wrong) predictions  Kentucky\\'s Aaron Harrison and his teammates, along with coach John Calipari, hold up their trophy after reaching the Final Four on March 30, 2014. Image: David J. Phillip/Associated Press1. UConn\\'s charming run ends at the hands of a more balanced and experienced Florida squad. The Gators win 72-64 and advance to the championship game.  2. Kentucky\\'s talent proves too much for Wisconsin. The Badgers make it tough, but Kentucky\\'s superstar freshman don\\'t crack, and pull out the 69-65 win to advance.  3. It\\'s experience versus raw talent in the national final, and raw talent wins out. The Kentucky freshman — once billed as messiahs in sneakers, then dismissed as sulky underachievers — bring their story full circle. Final score: Kentucky 78, Florida 71.

Scott Moody put the most groundbreaking work his company has done on display this October at North Carolina State University, where he showed off Apple's Touch ID to engineering students. Purchased last year by Apple for $356 million, AuthenTec is behind the iPhone 5S fingerprint sensor, a tiny device located underneath the phone's home button. The sensor uses a finger's grooves and pores to identify its owner, and it gets to know you better every time you use it.

Touch ID was initially called FingerLoc, and the technology sometimes worked in fits and starts. Moody once got IBM's chief technology officer to test out the sensor, only to have it misidentify him. But AuthenTec eventually revamped its sensor into a tiny device that only costs $0.80, and\\xa0Motorola, Fujitsu and Apple in particular expressed interest in the company. Now, after the sale and the introduction of the sensor into the iPhone 5S, the work Moody helped spearhead is a part of millions of lives. Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \",\n",

       " ' BlackBerry has previously admitted that sales of its new BlackBerry 10 smartphones were worse than expected; now we know just how bad sales were. BlackBerry revealed in an SEC filing Tuesday night that it sold 5.9 million smartphones to customers in the second quarter, about 4.2 million of which were running on BlackBerry\\'s old operating system, BlackBerry 7. That means the company\\'s BlackBerry 10 smartphones — the models that were meant to revitalize the company — sold fewer than 2 million units.  See also: Is BlackBerry Done? No matter how you slice it, those numbers are disappointing for BlackBerry. Smartphone sales were significantly less than the same quarter a year ago — 9.5 million — and came in well below those of other competitors in the market. Apple, for example, recently announced selling 9 million iPhone 5s and 5c devices just in its first weekend.  Last week, BlackBerry revealed that it posted a $965 million loss for the second quarter thanks largely to a massive $934 million charge related to unsold Z10 phones. In the days leading up to the report, BlackBerry also announced that it had received an acquisition offer from Fairfax Financial Holdings, and later cited that offer as a reason not to hold its traditional call with analysts after releasing its earnings report. Tuesday\\'s SEC filing effectively serves as a substitute for the earnings call. In the filing, BlackBerry offers a few explanations for the rapid decline in its performance ranging from greater competition in developing markets to the rise of the bring-your-own-device trend in offices. \"The intense competition impacting the company’s financial and operational results that previously affected demand in the United States market is now being experienced globally, including in international markets where the company has historically experienced rapid growth,\" BlackBerry said, referring in particular to Android devices.  BlackBerry also cited \"uncertainty\" around its possible acquisition as a factor, and even suggested that its apps — or lack of them — may be part of the problem: \"The decline can also be attributed to consumer preferences for devices with access to the broadest number of applications, such as those available in the iOS and Android environments.\" BlackBerry stock declined by 5% in morning trading following the filing.

       " ' Walmart last week announced the availability of iPhone 5 on a Straight Talk no-contract plan with unlimited voice, text and data, but like most so-called unlimited plans, this one too has a limit. For $45 a month, you can use up to 2GB of data, which these days isn\\'t a whole lot. Stream a movie on your shiny new iPhone? Not likely. However, Walmart has made it easier to buy an iPhone 5 off-contract by offering $25-a-month financing on the purchase of a phone as long as you use a Walmart credit card. Only a few prepaid providers offer the newest iPhone (Cricket ; C Spire, a regional provider in the South), and you\\'ll pay $649 up front for the phone. At Walmart, you have the option to buy the phone outright or put it on your card with no interest fee. It\\'s no secret that carriers use the term \"unlimited\" to describe plans that indeed include what the industry calls a soft data cap. That means when you use your data allotment, the service slows data speeds to a crawl. Technically, data is unlimited, but it\\'s so slow that it\\'s unusable. For the majority of smartphone users, 2GB of data is often enough as long as a reliable Wi-Fi connection is available. Streaming video can quickly eat up data, but if you watch a movie over Wi-Fi, it won\\'t count against your data allotment.  SEE ALSO: Why You Probably Don\\'t Need an Unlimited Data Plan But choosing a prepaid plan instead of a two-year contract for your smartphone saves consumers around $1,000 or more over a 24-month period. For instance, an AT&T customer will pay $70 for voice, $20 for messaging and $30 for 3GB of data a month — that\\'s $120 a month compared with $45 via Walmart\\'s Straight Talk. The iPhone 5 16GB in black and white is available at most Walmart locations. For an additional $15 a month, Straight Talk subscribers can add international calling to Mexico, Canada and India.

       " '   3 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW1. A man, identified as 18-year-old Antonio Martin, was shot by a police officer in Berkeley, Missouri.2. Authorities say the officer was responding to a reported theft when the man aimed a gun at him.3. Crowds gathered at the scene and clashed with police. Fireworks and bricks were thrown.  A police officer fatally shot an 18-year-old man late Tuesday night at a gas station in Berkeley, Missouri, near Ferguson, after the man pointed a handgun at the officer, authorities said. A crowd then arrived at the scene and an intense clash broke out between protesters and police. Police identified him as Antonio Martin on Wednesday morning. Martin was black; police said the officer who shot him was a 34-year-old white male, a six-year veteran of the Berkeley Police Department. Authorities quickly laid out their version of events in a press conference Wednesday morning. They said the officer had arrived at the gas station to check on a reported theft and had started talking to Martin and another person. Police released this surveillance video from the gas station, which ends when they say Martin raises a gun at the officer in the upper-left corner:  Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police said his department had paused the public version of the video at that point, not showing the ensuing shooting, out of respect for Martin\\'s family. He said more video would be forthcoming. The officer had been issued a body cam but had not clipped it on; his squad car\\'s dash cam did not activate because the emergency lights had not been turned on.  In this image from the surveillance footage, police say the suspect is pointing a handgun at the officer.The officer fired three shots, Belmar said. One struck and fatally wounded Martin, another hit the squad car\\'s tire, and a third was unaccounted for. Martin did not fire his weapon, Belmar said. The second person fled, and police recovered a handgun at the scene. Some of Belmar\\'s press conference Wednesday morning can be seen below:  \"Bad choices were made,\" Belmar said. \"This individual could have complied with the officer, he could have ran away, he could have dropped the gun.\" Belmar did not initially identify the man who was shot as Martin, but he said he was \"known to law enforcement\" and had been arrested for three assaults, armed robbery, unlawful use of a weapon and other stealing charges since he was 17. After the shooting, about 200 to 300 people arrived at the gas station, some of whom clashed with police. Belmar said police didn\\'t use tear gas or flash bangs, but he said people in the crowd used three \"explosive devices,\" likely fireworks. Two were thrown at the gas station, near the gas pumps, and one across the street at a convenience store, starting a small fire. In addition, one person brought \"a bag of rocks,\" and several bricks were thrown at officers, according to Belmar. \"That\\'s pretty disturbing,\" he said.  Police try to control a crowd Wednesday, Dec. 24, 2014, on the lot of a gas station following a shooting Tuesday in Berkeley, Mo. Image: St. Louis Post-Dispatch/David Carson/Associated PressFour people were arrested for assaulting police officers during the fracas, Belmar said. One police officer was injured while trying to get away from one of the blasts, while another was hit in the face with a rock or brick. Berkeley is about two miles from Ferguson, where a police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. Belmar said the office of St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch would determine how to proceed in the Berkeley case. McCulloch\\'s office took the Ferguson case to a grand jury, which chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown. See the latest live updates below.

       " ' We knew Candy Crush Saga was big, just not this big. King Digital Entertainment, the company behind Candy Crush and a number of other games, filed paperwork on Tuesday for an IPO. In the filing, King revealed some stats about its most popular game that can only be described as jaw-dropping: Candy Crush had an average of 93 million daily active users in December, more than 1 billion games played per day and it accounted for 78% of the company\\'s overall revenue in the fourth quarter. See also: \\'Candy Crush Saga\\' Update Will Suck Even More of Your Time To put it another way, Candy Crush, which launched less than two years ago, generated more than $450 million in revenue for King in the December quarter, nearly double the revenue that 8-year-old Twitter generated in the same period. It\\'s also likely that Candy Crush has a comparable number of users to Twitter, assuming that even a slim majority of King\\'s 408 million monthly users were from Candy Crush. \"We believe Candy Crush Saga, our top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time,\" the company noted in its filing. That fact may prove to be both a blessing and a curse for King as it prepares to go public.  King has more than 180 other games in addition to Candy Crush, but as the company admits three different times in its filing, \"a small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue.\" In fact, the company\\'s next most popular game is called Pet Rescue, which has 15 million daily users — a sixth of what Candy Crush has.  King\\'s revenue has ballooned thanks to the success of Candy Crush Saga, but that won\\'t last forever.\"They\\'ve only really had one big success. That\\'s Candy Crush,\" says Brian Blau, an analyst with Gartner. \"Clearly that\\'s a lot bigger than their other games. But as we know, as games go, hits go.\"  Eventually, the incredible success of Candy Crush will fade. As it is, King\\'s revenue dipped slightly in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, which the company attributed to \"a decrease in Candy Crush Saga gross bookings.\" King had a modestly successful business before Candy Crush, with $63 million in revenues in 2011, but then it was supercharged by effectively creating a Twitter-sized business, which is now shrinking. In the Risk Factors section of its F-1 filing, King noted that this downward trend in Candy Crush revenue could continue: In future periods, we expect Candy Crush Saga to represent a smaller percentage of our total mobile channel gross bookings as we diversify our mobile game portfolio. If the gross bookings of our top games, including Candy Crush Saga are lower than anticipated and we are unable to broaden our portfolio of games or increase gross bookings from those games, we will not be able to maintain or grow our revenue and our financial results could be adversely affected. That doesn\\'t necessarily mean that King is doomed to suffer the same fate as Zynga, which went public at $10 a share in late 2011 and dipped to as low as $2 a share on concerns about its ability to transition from desktop to mobile gaming and produce more hits. In fact, some analysts argue that King may be able to benefit from Zynga\\'s rocky experience on the public market much in the same way that Twitter benefitted from Facebook. \"The advantage investors have is they have experience with Zynga,\" says Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee. \"They can ask more probing questions. They can be more careful on the price they are going to pay. And the company and the bankers are also more fully aware of the risk investors are going to take.\"  But why take that risk at all? The filing states that King made $568 million in profit last year. Why does it need to raise another $500 million in an IPO? The short answer: Because it can. \"If their IPO is successful they will raise quite a lot of money and that will sustain their development for a long time,\" Blau says. Those additional funds can be put towards marketing efforts (the company spent $376 million on sales and marketing last year), possible acquisitions and developing games.  None of that guarantees King will ever find another success on par with Candy Crush, but it gives them more ammunition to try.  ',\n",

Toyota's managing officer Hiroyoshi Yoshiki said at Bloomberg's Next Big Thing conference in Sausalito, California on Tuesday that the company may build a hover car in the future. See also: Top 28 Google Street View Sightings The reasoning behind the concept is that a hover car would combat road friction and enhance efficiency, Yoshiki said.

Although no solid plans have been made to build a prototype, the concept has been bandied about among Toyota's research and development teams, he added.

       " ' Vegetarians, I\\'m truly sorry about this, but I love a good burger. One that\\'s medium rare, with just enough juice in it to form a slightly soggy layer within the bun. Add a crisp layer of lettuce, slice of tomato and half an avocado, and I\\'m in heaven. Cheese, fries and a soda? I can quit those kinds of calories, or replace them with salad and water. But try as I might, I can\\'t replace that beef patty.    Meat eaters like me are part of the problem. Livestock feed, livestock-related forest clearing and methane-filed livestock waste are responsible for 18% to 51% of greenhouse gas emissions, depending on which study you believe. The planet is getting hotter, the weather is getting wilder and the seas are rising, in large part because we just can\\'t quit our steaks and burgers.  See also: Google Scientists Want Google to Stop Funding Climate Change Denial That\\'s not even considering the ethical problems of the way cattle is treated or the public health nightmare of all the antibiotics pumped into livestock that ends up in our water system.  We can know all this, and still have it vanish from our minds when we\\'re hungry and staring at a menu, or hanging around a friend\\'s barbecue at the weekend. It\\'s in our programming. \"People are designed to love meat,\" says Richard Wrangham, a professor of biological anthropology at Harvard.  If we don\\'t care too much about where the meat is coming from, that\\'s part of the problem. But it can also be part of the solution.  The world saw its first lab-grown burger on Monday, thanks to a $330,000 investment from Google co-founder Sergey Brin and five years of effort by Mark Post at Maastricht University in Belgium. The basis for the burger: 20,000 protein strands grown from stem cells taken from a cow\\'s shoulder.  That still means meat is the basis of the burger — no tasteless soyburgers here. But it also means you\\'d need to keep vastly fewer quantities of cows to sustain present levels of beef consumption; probably few enough that they could be free range and grass-fed. All that extra farmland could be turned over to fruits and vegetables. And we\\'d slash our output of climate-changing methane — all without having to give up beef.  We\\'re in the early days of lab-grown beef, as shown by the price tag on this experiment. Post estimates we\\'re a decade or two away from a mass market solution. We\\'re also far from getting the consistency right; early tasters (seen in the video below) point out that the $330,000 burger is lacking in the kind of delicious fats that make beef so irresistible.   But they did at least recognize it as meat. And if we want to save the planet, that\\'s what we can do too. It would be easy to dismiss Post\\'s experiment as a \"Frankenburger,\" or to worry that it wouldn\\'t be as healthy as regular meat. In fact, it\\'s just muscle tissue doing what muscle tissue does, with very little encouragement. And given that there\\'s no need for antibiotics in lab-grown meat, this stuff is arguably healthier than what we\\'re used to.  Public perception is key. It could kill this neat little idea in its crib and doom us to a dangerous explosion in livestock landscape over the next 40 years. Or, if we\\'re enthusiastic about it, if we make it clear that this is what we want, then research dollars will follow.  Short of somehow converting a dozen friends to vegetarianism (and making sure they stay that way), showing your support for the lab-grown burger is one of the most important things you can do for the planet today.

       " ' SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL — Police in Brazil are searching for at least 11 men suspected of orchestrating a daring and meticulously-planned raid on a Samsung factory located in the city of Campinas, 50 miles northwest of São Paulo. Some 40,000 electronic devices, including cellphones, tablets and notebooks, were taken in the late hours of Sunday into the early hours of Monday. Police say the total value of the products could total more than $36 million, but Samsung is disputing that number, saying it\\'s closer to $6.3 million. Security officials in São Paulo said that the assault, which lasted three to four hours, began just before midnight Sunday and involved around 20 criminals, adding that police are currently investigating the mass burglary. “Witnesses say a bus with eight employees was about to enter the company compound when seven heavily-armed men hijacked it, taking two people hostage and dumping the others on the side of a nearby highway,” São Paulo\\'s public security secretariat said in a phone interview. “The men then entered the compound, overpowering the security and taking their weapons, before opening the gates to allow access to a convoy of seven trucks, which were then used to load up the gadgets.\" The criminals reportedly forced the security guards at the Samsung factory to continue working normally and pretend as though everything was fine. Police would not confirm whether any arrests have been made yet. Local media in Brazil say around 200 personnel in the company were taken hostage for a short time while the burglary took place, although Samsung says that number was closer to 50. Samsung staff are analyzing internal close circuit TV footage that police will cross-check this with their database of known criminals. What is clear is that the criminals had intimate knowledge of the runnings of the compound\\'s operations to carry out the raid, and only targeted devices without trackers, according to the Brazilian news portal G1.  The area around Campinas, which is home to a number of key electronics companies, has been dubbed locally as the \"Bermuda Triangle\"; theft of product shipments increased 55% year-over-year in 2013. Postal convoys have even been given armed escorts in the area, according to the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. Police say the stolen products are likely headed for the black market rather than for a particular recipient. There is huge demand for cell phones and other electronics through the black market in Brazil; crippling taxes on manufactured products means that some items can be twice the price you would pay in the U.S. A Samsung Galaxy S5 with 16GB cost nearly $1,200 when it launched in Brazil, but was available for $599 when it launched in the U.S. in April. The South Korean electronics giant has two bases in Brazil: one in Campinas, and another in the capital of Manaus. FoxConn, which produces products for Samsung\\'s main competitor, Apple, has a major operation just a few miles away, in the São Paulo satellite city of Jundiaí, which produces iPhones and iPads — the only location outside Asia to do so when it opened in 2012.

       " ' LOS ANGELES — Heroes creator Tim Kring would have spilled details on the upcoming reboot, Heroes Reborn, but truth is, he says, they don\\'t exist yet.  \"I don\\'t have a lot to say about it,\" he said after presenting a panel during the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles for his upcoming USA Network series DIG. \"It\\'s an ever-changing thing in my brain as to what it should be. And there\\'s not a tremendous amount to say about it at this point.\"  See also: 10 New Summer Series to Keep Your TV Addiction Alive Production on DIG, about an FBI agent stationed in Jerusalem, has taken up much of his time, he said, but he hopes to focus on Reborn, which like the original will be a sci-fi drama about people with superhuman abilities.  \"DIG is very much my focus right now and when it\\'s in a position where I can step away, that\\'s when I\\'ll really start to focus on the reboot,\" he said. Thus far, Jack Coleman is the only original cast member set to return for the miniseries. There are not yet solid plans for more returns from old cast members, Kring said, adding in one interview that the new show would revolve largely around new characters: \"I always felt that there was a giant interest in that brand and that that brand could move on in other ways.\"   One person we probably won\\'t see? Zachary Quinto, who said that while he\\'s been in touch with Kring, his eye is not currently on revisiting his character, super-powered serial killer Sylar.  \"I\\'m so grateful for the experience that show was. It changed my life and set me on a path that I very likely would not have been on otherwise, and I\\'m thrilled to know they\\'re making it again ... but A) I don\\'t know if I\\'d be available, frankly. I don\\'t know exactly when they\\'re planning to shoot and I\\'m pretty booked up for the foreseeable future. And B) I\\'m interested in moving forward and diversifying,\" he told Mashable while promoting his upcoming Starz reality show, The Chair.  \"The idea of going back to a character that\\'s so archetypal and iconic is something I have a little bit of a hard time wrapping my mind around,\" Quinto said. \"I want to do as many different things as I can. So I don\\'t know that going back to re-portray the character that a lot of people still associate with me is necessarily going to serve that. Regardless of anything. I wish them 100 percent the best and even if I can\\'t be a part of it, I can\\'t wait to watch it.\" Announced back in February and based on the 2006 series, Heroes Reborn will consist of 13 episodes and air in 2015. NBC says a supplemental digital series that will launch before the TV premiere will help introduce the plot and characters.  Fans have been waiting to see whether NBC or Kring will bring back more of the original cast, which included Hayden Panettiere, Ali Larter, Milo Ventimiglia, Masi Oka, Greg Grunberg and Adrian Pasdar.

Pictures in 2011, Flixster allows users to watch films online using a multi-platform digital rights management and storage system called UltraViolet.  \"The vast majority of Veronica Mars backers who attempted to redeem their [Flixster] code had a successful experience,\" a Warner Bros. Pictures spokesperson told Mashable. \"A communication was sent to all backers yesterday from Rob Thomas telling them to get in touch with Veronica Mars technical support if they were experiencing problems.\"  The message from Thomas went up Friday on Kickstarter, giving any disgruntled fans reassurance that the project\\'s producers were indeed listening to their concerns in real-time. However, that did little to quell the frustration from backers who hadn\\'t checked the original Kickstarter update page.   \"We are, of course, working diligently to ensure that all the Veronica Mars backers have a great experience,\" says Warner Bros. Pictures\\' spokesperson.     For the backers who experienced difficulties with Flixster/UltraViolet and opted to purchase the film on another platform, the studio sent out a message on Saturday offering a full refund of the price charged on another service, or a $10 refund of their Kickstarter pledge used for the digital download. There may be a lesson here for other studios involved in such projects in the future. That lesson? Listen to your fans. Unlike most studios facing the wrath of unhappy fans, Warner Bros. Pictures issued a fairly rapid and detailed response to unhappy Kickstarter supporters. That quick response was almost certainly linked to the fact that the fans made the project possible in the first place.  Fans of the show ultimately gave the project $5.7 million on Kickstarter, well above the original $2 million sought by Thomas and his project partners. Box Office Mojo, which lists the film\\'s budget at $6 million, reported that the film had already earned $1 million in just its first day in 291 theaters.  By adding crowdfunding to the equation, it now appears that fans may have earned a new and much stronger voice in Hollywood.       window._msla=window.loadScriptAsync||function(src,id){if(document.getElementById(id))return;var js=document.createElement(\\'script\\');js.id=id;js.src=src;document.getElementsByTagName(\\'script\\')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}; _msla(\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"twitter_jssdk\"); ',\n",

See also: Ebola Author Says Outbreak Is \\'Part of a Pattern\\' of Emerging, Deadly Diseases Six truckloads of material were collected from Duncan\\'s apartment and incinerated at a facility in Port Arthur, Texas on Friday. The material, which included linen, bedding and carpet, was supposed to be shipped to a landfill in Carlyss, Louisiana for disposal. However, Attorney General James D. \"Buddy\" Caldwell said he will ask for a temporary restraining order to prevent that from happening.  “We certainly share sadness and compassion for those who have lost their lives and loved ones to this terrible virus, but the health and safety of our Louisiana citizens is our top priority,\" Caldwell said in a statement provided to Mashable. \"There are too many unknowns at this point, and it is absurd to transport potentially hazardous Ebola waste across state lines. This situation is certainly unprecedented and we want to approach it with the utmost caution. We just can’t afford to take any risks when it comes to this deadly virus.”  Louisiana Attorney Gen. Buddy Caldwell speaks about a lawsuit his office filed against State Farm on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2014, in Baton Rouge, La.Image: Melinda Deslatte/Associated PressThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention, however, has said that incineration is effective in \"eliminating viral infectivity and provides waste minimization.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation said the incinerated material is free from its Hazardous Materials Regulations in regards to infectious substances.

Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of Texas\\'s health department, said, \"The ash would pose absolutely no risk.\" Caldwell\\'s office said it is in contact with Louisiana health and environmental agencies involved in the matter, and is in the process of finalizing the restraining order application.

       " ' TORONTO – Chris Evans isn’t half-bad as a director, it turns out. His feature debut, Before We Go, is about exactly that. There is a growing discontent among Hollywood’s A-list actors to just be A-list actors, for reasons that don’t compute for us mortals: They travel the world pretending to be our heroes, make enough money to work only occasionally and, as certified Beautiful People, have a license to date and mate among themselves. Shouldn\\'t that be enough? SEE ALSO: \\'The Imitation Game\\': The Only Enigma Is All the Praise for This Cumberbatch Clunker Maybe the Alpha wiring that got them there in the first place inevitably leads to the need to be in charge, because it sure seems a good many of today’s top-billed — Angelina Jolie, George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Affleck and James Franco just to name-drop a few — are dogging second careers as writers, producers and directors. Evans is just the latest mid-career matinee idol to seek the “multi-hyphenate” mantle after locking up a lifetime of global blockbuster fame and fortune. When Marvel signed him as Johnny Storm and later Captain America, no one would blame him for spending his free time, if not the remaining 60 years of his life, kicking it in the Caribbean.  Chris Evans directing a scene of \"Before We Go.\"Why Evans is instead slumming it in Canada, premiering a microbudget indie on an party\\'s-almost-over Friday night that arrived at the Toronto Film Festival without U.S. distribution, only he can explain. (Evans declined to be interviewed after Mashable saw an early screening and, at the request of its public relations pros, gave some candid feedback). Before We Go, in which Evans also co-stars opposite Alice Eve, has a lot of things going for it — chiefly Evans, who is always so at ease onscreen, so full of charm and shucks-y wit that you utterly forget how famous and good looking and, well, superhero-ey he is. That’s a good thing, because Evans is offering himself here as a struggling musician with a sentimental streak, who we first see playing his trumpet and busking for change in Grand Central Station late one lonely night. Behind the camera, it\\'s immediately clear that Evans has an eye for this: the actors’ lines flow naturally, the shots are varied and thoughtfully composed, and he tries a few tricks (cutting away to the actors doing things other than talking while their dialogue flows as if in voice-over, for instance) that feel not gimmicky, but elemental to the film’s bleary, out-all-night tone. Evans builds and delivers a few moments, minor action sequences are smooth and there is a consistency that suggests vision. The trouble with Before We Go — and there is plenty of that — is the story itself, a damsel-in-distress caper. Well, until it quickly morphs into a race-against-the-clock mystery, then careens into a vague, opposites-attract rom-com going through a long-shot redemption phase before finally settling on being just a really drawn-out meet-cute that may or may not actually develop, no spoilers here. In other words, yeah. It’s a bit of a mess. We start with Nick (Evans) solemnly playing his trumpet when a well-heeled blonde (Eve), racing to make a train, drops her cell phone at his feet. He scoops up the broken fragments and chases her down, finding her desperate and shattered-looking, and for good reason: Her purse has been stolen, her phone is now in pieces and she just missed the last train to Boston, where she really, really needs to be. Though she has no idea what to do next, she forcefully declines Nick\\'s offer for help and wanders out into the night, not getting too far before rolling up on a trio of stumbling young men who are leering, pointing and drunkenly giggling at the wayward WASP. You half expect them to get clobbered by a red, white and blue shield – and you’re half right, because Nick shows up, puts his arm around Brooke and briskly walks her past the danger. “You didn’t think I’d pass up the opportunity to be a hero, now did you?” Evans later says, an effective tension-breaker for the Marvel fans in attendance, probably something Evans improv’ed or later baked into the script (by a four-headed hydra of screenwriters, who include the executive producer and two co-producers, in case you were wondering why Before We Go is a bit of a tangled knot). Nick talks Brooke into at least letting him try to recover her purse, and thus begins the “caper” portion of the program — it’s well past 1 a.m., neither of them has anything better to do and anyway, he’s being Charming Chris Evans, so why not?  Chris Evans and Alice Eve in \"Before We Go.\"But the Case of the Missing Purse is merely the first of their many hole-in-the-bucket chain of problems: They need money, she is hiding some kind of secret as to why she’s in New York in the first place (and needs to get home before sunrise to save her marriage), and did he mention that he’s in town to try to rekindle a long-dead flame at a wedding reception that’s — well look at the time — still going on? Instead of adding up to something, each of these micro-conflicts (and more) is conveniently settled, leaving us at one point with two people who vaguely know each other, aimlessly wandering around New York City (and it’s astounding how much they’ve been able to pack into what’s presumably been all of two to three hours — shouldn\\'t the sun be up by now?).  Credit is due that these are two sharply written individuals who have chemistry they can\\'t deny, but nothing like the life circumstances to match, a thing that happens more in life than the movies. If their conversation were of a certain youthful, intellectual exuberance, or were we not already made to care (and then not care) about the missing purse or the passage to Boston or the Old Flame, this could be a sort of modern, more grown-up Before Sunrise.  But alas, that train has long left the station. The good news is, there was a warm, unoccupied hotel room at their disposal all along via the wedding party, and though they eventually go there, whether or not they’re going to, you know, go there is the last remaining suspense in Before We Go.  But by now, it’s too late — all we ever wanted these two to do was get a room, and with the sun squeezing through the blackout curtains and both Nick and Brooke wistfully taking stock of their very different lives, we’re too exhausted to much care whether they fish or capsize the boat. RadiusTWC, an offshoot of The Weinstein Co., bought Before We Go at Toronto before its Friday night premiere (and before any reviews were allowed to post) for what was reportedly a robust seven-figure deal. With Evans and Eve in the description, it should have some luck as a VOD title — with some limited theatrical play, most likely — for a company that knows that business model well. And good for Evans. It’s a mixed start for him as a director, but the upshot is that he didn’t screw it up; in fact, he may have rescued a flawed concept with some touches that make Before We Go ultimately watchable, at least. Here’s  hoping he can temper his admittedly strong sentimental streak when choosing his next project to helm. Or he could just stick to acting. He’s really quite good at that. ',\n",
       " ' Getting a new job offer or making a new business deal is exciting — but negotiating? Not so much. The process of negotiation\\xa0can be nerve-wracking, and it\\'s easy to make mistakes, especially if you haven\\'t had much experience negotiating. Before your next negotiation attempt, make sure you watch out for these seven common negotiating mistakes. Lacking confidence \"Many people think they need to show a certain kind of confidence, like being loud, bold or brazen, to successfully negotiate a deal. Others think that a lot of experience is required to be a good negotiator. Most of the time, it merely takes tenacity and good old preparation to ensure you are aptly equipped to assert mutually desirable terms, anticipate objections, and discern what … motivators or \\'hot buttons\\' will resonate with your opponent,\" said Eldonna Lewis-Fernandez, CEO of consulting and training firm Dynamic Vision International and author of \"Think Like a Negotiator\" (Amazon Digital Services, 2014). Lewis-Fernandez added that projecting confidence also means having a heart, which can make the opposition less defensive and more likely to agree with your stipulations. However, it\\'s also important to back up your confidence with solid, well-researched information. Thinking something is non-negotiable You may not think the terms in front of you are negotiable, but anything is possible with the right attitude. \"When you think like a negotiator, everything is negotiable! It\\'s a mindset you have to operate from in order to become not just a good negotiator, but a great one,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. She added that, while negotiators must adhere to several rules, even those are negotiable so long as you can propose an ethical, viable and mutually beneficial alternative. SEE ALSO: A Surprising Negotiation Tactic That Works Not building relationships first Relationship building is key to a successful negotiation, but it goes beyond networking\\xa0events where professionals hand out business cards, Lewis-Fernandez said. Her advice? Slow down and make real, personal connections with people, and learn as much as you can about them. By doing so, you can make negotiating more meaningful for everyone involved. \"Find out something about them, personally, and not just their business. You might be surprised how well you can leverage what you learn through a genuine conversation with someone,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. Not asking for what you want If you don\\'t ask for what you want, you\\'ll never have the opportunity to get it. While facing rejection is tough, letting it hold you back during a negotiation is a big mistake. \"In business, rejection is never personal. It\\'s merely a reflection that you did not present a viable argument substantiating why you should get what you want. It\\'s the offer that\\'s being rejected, not you, so keep emotions in check and recalibrate your approach,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. The only way to master the art of dealing with rejection, Lewis-Fernandez said, is to get rejected and keep asking. Most of the time you, will either receive what you want or an acceptable alternative. Talking too much When negotiating, you have to have to explain your side and give your pitch, but talking too much could actually be a deal-breaker. \"There\\'s an old adage that says, \\'He or she who speaks next loses.\\' When discussing a deal, if you simply stop talking and get comfortable with the awkwardness of silence, your ability to win your argument, sell the product or get a concession in the negotiation increases significantly,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. Not documenting it A successful negotiation is about much more than just getting the other side to agree to your terms. You need to properly document everything that happens during a negotiation to avoid future issues. \"A myriad of problems can occur when the terms of a deal are not put in writing, because what you think the other party said and what they think you said can be two different things,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. Signing without reading \"Modern life is fast-paced, and people are usually engaged in multiple things at once, making it difficult to focus and causing some to sign legal documents without reading them first.\\xa0The result can be nothing short of disastrous. Make sure you read any agreement or contract in full, to ensure you are not confirming terms you will regret and cannot undo, which can cause copious problems for your future,\" Lewis-Fernandez said. To avoid future problems, Lewis-Fernandez suggested consulting with a contracts attorney to review contractual documents or anything that requires a signature.  Want to Inspire Employees?

       " '     P\\'Trique, of Sh*t Fashion Girls Say fame, is back again, this time in a promotional video for Net-a-Porter\\'s discount site, The Outnet. See also: 6 Bloggers Who Tumbled Their Way Into New York Fashion Week In the video, P\\'Trique — who\\'s racked up a little too much on her credit card, thanks to The Outnet — lands a job at the company. On one assignment, she takes a conference call from London and Shanghai to discuss local sourcing in China — though she spends a lot more time discussing her own outfits with co-workers. Soon, she\\'s up for a promotion. But she can only get promoted, the video indicates, if people share the video with the hashtag #InsideTheOutnet. A spokesperson for The Outnet says a similar video was developed for the company\\'s annual meeting, and proved so popular that The Outnet decided to develop a public version for consumers. The spokesperson added that the video isn\\'t designed for recruitment purposes, per se, but meant to boost general brand awareness. The Outnet isn\\'t the first brand to adopt P\\'Trique as the star of its online video: Maybelline used the character to announce a spokesmodel in April 2012. The Outnet\\'s video is, in my opinion, more amusing, but its call to action is confusing. I imagine it would have been more fun (and shareable) if viewers could get more involved in P\\'Trique\\'s promotion — perhaps by making public endorsements on Twitter and/or LinkedIn.

       " ' Architect Gert Wingårdh and illustrator Kustaa Saksi have designed an installation at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair for \"The Hello! Show,\" which offers debates around the workplace, design and communication. The event space has been constructed using 700,000 sheets in total. It is reminiscent of a church interior, with rows of high tables in front of an \"altar\" for the panel. The tabletops are made of a mirror laminate and balance on stacks of A4 paper sheets.  Stacks also hang from the roof in a Venetian blind-like construction, with the lowest sheet in each stack carrying part of an enormous illustration that forms the dome-shaped ceiling. \"I’m fascinated by architecture and antique ceiling paintings in temples all over the world, and the way they’ve attracted people to share their thoughts and ideas,\" Saksi said. \"I’ve wanted to create a similar esthetics, mixed with orientalism, art, mathematics, science and psychedelia, by depicting communication as Darwinistic evolution.

       " '     Let\\'s get one thing straight: Brandon Knight did the right thing. He made the right play, the hard-working play, the courageous play, and there are plenty of other image-conscious NBA players who never would have stepped in there the way he did.  But, that being said — daaaaaaaaaaaaamn.  If you didn\\'t catch the highlight last night and need to get up to speed, here\\'s what happened: Knight\\'s Detroit Pistons were taking on the Los Angeles Clippers Sunday evening. The Clippers — known to sports fans as \"Lob City\" for their propensity for high-flying alley-oops — ran a lob play for center DeAndre Jordan, who came steaming down the lane with all of his 6-feet-11 inches and 265 pounds hurtling toward the rim. The lob went up. Jordan went up. Knight — who stands 6-foot-3 and weights 189 pounds - went up. The two collided in mid air and Knight went down. Hard. Then the ball bounced off his head.   Words cannot really do a play of such epic viciousness and wanton disregard for human life proper justice, however, so you should just watch the YouTube video embedded above several times. (Pro tip: Pay special attention to the gleeful reaction of the four kids seated courtside.)  The dunk, unsurprisingly, blew up the basketball Twitters, with both Jordan and Knight\\'s names trending worldwide (Knight\\'s name was trending again Monday morning). But it didn\\'t stop there. Someone edited Knight\\'s Wikipedia page to read that he in fact died in the game. Cause of death? DeAndre Jordan.  And — much like when an unconscious Manny Pacquiao received a derisive meme treatment after being knocked out in a December fight — Internet jokesters were quick to delight in Knight\\'s plight. To whit:     Jordan\\'s excellent post-dunk face got plenty of well-deserved love too:   Knight, for his part, took the posterization in stride, posting this terrific response to Twitter late Sunday night:  It wasn\\'t in the scouting reports that the clippers threw lobs lol — Brandon E Knight (@BrandonKnight07) March 11, 2013  Roasting Knight was all good and fun. That incredible play will live on for time immemorial, much to Knight\\'s eternal chagrin. But let\\'s not get too carried way here, sports fans; Brandon Knight is still living a life the rest of us can only dream about. Internet columnist and former Cal basketball player Rod Benson perhaps summed the big-picture situation up best with this tweet:  He\\'s gonna drive in a car we all wish we could to a home we all wish we lived in and probably sex a girl we all wish we had. #nextgame — Rod Benson (@boomtho) March 11, 2013  What were the funniest Brandon Knight reactions you saw online? Share them with us in the comments.  BONUS: Posterized! YouTube\\'s 12 Most Epic NBA Dunks    Dunks        1. Blake Griffin on Kendrick Perkins This dunk set the Internet aflame in January. The official NBA YouTube video already has more than 5 million views. The dunk prompted Perkins to call out LeBron James in the press for tweeting the epic slam.          2. LeBron James on John Lucas The night before Griffin\\'s monumental throw-down, James turned in a classic of his own. He cleared Bulls guard John Lucas to catch this backdoor alley-oop.          3. Dwyane Wade on Anderson Verejao  A couple years ago, before he and James joined forces on the Heat, Dwyane Wade completely overwhelmed James\\' then-teammate, Varejao. In the immortal words of commentator Reggie Miller, \"Welcome to your Kodak moment, Anderson Verejao!\"          4. Baron Davis on Andrei Kirilenko  This dunk will live forever in the hearts of Golden State Warriors fans. It came during the middle of the team\\'s improbable \"We Believe\" playoff run in 2007. Davis\\' weird, belly-baring celebration, which earned him a technical foul, brings it up another notch.          5. Shaquille O\\'Neal on basketball hoop designers This dunk isn\\'t technically \"on\" anyone, but young Shaq pulling down an entire basketball support is epic enough to make any list. As the esteemed Bill Walton would say, \"Throw it down, big man!\"           6. Tom Chambers on Mark Jackson Current Warriors coach Mark Jackson had a stellar playing career with several NBA teams, but he was on the receiving end of probably the greatest NBA dunk ever by a white guy.          7. Scottie Pippen on Patrick Ewing Scottie Pippen obliterated Knicks center Patrick Ewing in this 1994 dunk, and this two-minute video tells the entire story.          8. Michael Jordan on Patrick Ewing Pippen\\'s Bulls teammate — some guy named Michael Jordan — also had a ruthless dunk over Ewing. He actually had a couple, but this one is the most savage of all.          9. John Starks on the Chicago Bulls However, Knicks guard John Starks gave the high flying Bulls a taste of their own medicine in 1993 with this lefty flush. Lore has it that Starks caught Jordan on this one, but that\\'s debatable, at best. Check the tape and decide for yourself.          10. Allen Iverson on Marcus Camby Back in the \\'90s, when both still played for the teams that drafted them, tiny Allen Iverson was all like, \"Marcus, this elevator goes to 10 and I\\'m dropping you off at 7.\"          11. Kevin Johnson on Hakeem Olajuwon  Johnson is currently the mayor of Sacramento, Calif., but back in 1994 the short point guard did this to Hakeem Olajuwon. How many politicians can include \"dunked over a Hall of Fame center\" on their resumes?          12. Vince Carter on Frederic Weis  We know Vince Carter\\'s all-time classic isn\\'t technically an NBA dunk, but it\\'s so good we\\'ll make an exception. Playing in the off-season for the U.S. at the 2000 Olympics, Carter cleared the 7-foot-2-inch Weis to throw it down.

       " ' Before Jeffrey Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield even launched Harry\\'s, an online service for men\\'s grooming products, they had their eyes set on a first acquisition. The pair wanted to buy an old German razor factory for $100 million. That isn\\'t how most new startups operate, but then again this wasn\\'t Raider\\'s first time around. Raider was one of the cofounders behind Warby Parker, the popular e-commerce service for eyeglasses founded in 2010 and currently said to be valued at around $500 million.  In 2011, Raider received a call from Katz-Mayfield, a friend, who complained about his experience buying razors and shaving cream at a store. \"Could you do it better?\" Katz-Mayfield asked. That conversation sparked the idea for a company that would sell high-quality shaving products for a reasonable price to compete with more established businesses like Gillette and The Art of Shaving and upstarts like Dollar Shave Club. But it turned out to be harder than they thought to find high-quality razors. See also: Warby Parker Co-Founder Launches Men\\'s Grooming Brand The founders searched for a manufacturer with the know-how and willingness to would work with them on producing the razors. \"For awhile we thought we couldn\\'t even build [it] because we couldn\\'t find a manufacturer whose blades we\\'d be proud to sell,\" Raider tells Mashable. That changed in late 2011 when they came across Feintechnik, a German razor manufacturer founded in 1920.  \"In late 2011, I pitched our investors that we should buy the factory,\" he says. \"They asked how much it would cost. We said $100 million. They said, \\'Okay, why don\\'t you go build your brand first?\\'\" For the next year, Raider and Katz-Mayfield focused on building up the company, raised a seed round of \"a few million dollars\" and officially launched Harry\\'s in early 2013. In its first nine months, Harry\\'s sold \"well over\" 100,000 shaving kits — a razor, shaving cream and set of blades — and opened up a barbershop location in New York. Now, a little more than a year after that first conversation with investors, the founders finally got their wish. Harry\\'s announced Wednesday that it has raised $122.5 million from investors in equity and debt, and used $100 million of that capital to purchase the German manufacturer. To put that another way, a 10-month-old startup just purchased a 93-year-old business for $100 million.  The Feintechnik factory in Germany that Harry\\'s just bought for $100 million.Raider touts the deal as a \"transformative event\" for Harry\\'s which will allow it to \"vertically integrate\" its business so that it controlled its supply chain and builds relationships with customers. With the deal, Harry\\'s now finds itself with a factory and 427 additional employees. The startup had just 35 employees prior to the acquisition. \"Over time, a bunch of people on our team have gotten to know a bunch of people on their team,\" he says, noting that Harry\\'s had a working relationship with Feintechnik long before the deal. While the vast majority of the new capital went towards buying the manufacturer, Harry\\'s will still have an additional $22.5 million to play with. The plan is to use the money to invest in new and better shaving products, as well as to possibly expand its offline presence. \"The cornershop in New York has done exceptionally well and we are thinking about how we can continue to develop strong relationships with customers through brick-and-mortar stores,\" Raider says.  Investors in the funding round included Tiger Global, Thrive Capital Partners, Highland Capital and several other firms.  ',\n",

       " \" In the wake of a brutal string of gang-rapes of female bus passengers — one in New Delhi and one in Gurdaspur — Indian officials have unveiled a new weapon they’re hoping can help combat violence against women. Kapil Sibal, minister of information technology, announced last week that the Center for Development of Advanced Computing, a unit within the Indian government’s Department of Electronics and Information Technology, plans to make a watch that can alert authorities and family members if danger is at hand. The watch would be equipped with a button that sends a text message to the nearest police station and chosen relatives. A GPS system within the device will help pinpoint the wearer’s location. The watch will also feature a built-in video camera that will be activated and record for 30 minutes once the button is pushed. SEE ALSO: 10 Trickiest Spy Gadgets Ever  According the Wall Street Journal’s India Real Time, Sibal said he expects the government to develop a prototype by mid-year and eventually allocate companies to produce the device. A government press release stated that initial talks had taken place between the government and India Telephone Industries (ITI), a state-run telecommunications equipment manufacturer. ITI’s chairman, K.L. Dhingra later confirmed those talks to India Real Time. Sibal said the watch is proposed to be sold in two versions — one for $20 and another for about $50. Though when it comes a rape prevention tool, is there really any room for a discount option? And can the watch really help close the gap between a threat and the law enforcement’s response? SEE ALSO: Apple Patents Smart Shoes  While the watch is certainly better than nothing, some women’s rights activists are skeptical… and rightly so. A 2011 study by Trust Law, an organization which calls itself a “global hub” of “news and information on good governance and women’s rights,” ranked India as the fourth most-dangerous country for women. And if you’re unfamiliar with dowry-related violence in India, here’s a refresher, compliments of the UN. “I don’t think this will make any difference in controlling rape cases,” Sehba Farooqui, a woman’s rights activist in Delhi, told India Real Time. Still, this is a step in the right direction. Let’s just hope those steps turn into strides.

       " ' Return on investment is a pretty fundamental goal of any business endeavor. Yet the term didn\\'t really gain much currency until the mid-1960s. As this Google Ngram chart shows, since then, the term \"ROI\" has greatly increased in popularity.  Why? It\\'s clear that the idea of getting a return on one\\'s investment was always been a topic of conversation among the business-minded. But it used to be called something else: Return on Capital. In fact, this Ngram shows that ROI took off just as ROC was waning. Meanwhile, a more down-to-earth description of ROI, \"bang for your buck,\" appeared to rise in popularity with ROI. It\\'s unclear why the change in language took effect. However, it\\'s easy to see why ROI is viewed as important. After all, if you\\'re plowing money into a business and have nothing to show for it, you\\'re not going to be in business for long. Fortunately, there\\'s a simple formula for determining if that\\'s the case: Just take the gain from your investment and subtract the cost of your investment. Then divide that by the cost of your investment. For instance, if you spent $5 to make $7, then your profit is $2, which is divided by 5 to give you an ROI of $0.40 or 40%. John Longo, a clinical associate professor at Rutgers Business School in Newark and New Brunswick in New Jersey, says an ROI of 40% would be very good. He says the benchmark generally is 10%, which is the historic rate of return of the stock market. However, \"Use simple intuition. If you\\'re paying 8% interest to the bank, you have to be making more than 8%. It has to be greater than your cost of capital.\" While the process of determining ROI appears straightforward, there can be complications. It is notoriously difficult, for instance, to track the ROI of an ad campaign. A famous quote often attributed to 19th century department store mogul John Wanamaker: \"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don\\'t know which half.\" This was especially true for analog forms of advertising, like radio. \"Some [listeners] will have an interest and some won\\'t,\" Longo says, noting that he often hears political ads in New Jersey for candidates running in Connecticut for whom he can\\'t cast a vote. Digital media makes accountability somewhat easier, but it can still be tricky. As Facebook likes to argue, just because no one has clicked on a banner ad, doesn\\'t mean the ad didn\\'t have a positive influence on consumer behavior. Another complication to ROI is that it\\'s often calculated in the future. A big project, like a movie, assumes an ROI when in reality no one has any idea what it will earn. In addition, there\\'s often disagreement as to what constitutes an investment. Is it merely the money that was laid out of this particular project or should everything related to the business, including the opportunity costs involved with employees working on this rather than something else, part of the formula? Finally, muddying the waters further is the ultimate goal of your endeavor. You may, for instance, sell a product at a loss to eliminate the competition, in which case you\\'d have a negative ROI for that particular project, even though it might help your business down the road. Startups often run business at a loss for years as they try to build a large audience and then, only later, consider how to monetize that audience. (Facebook is a good example.) Despite such shortcomings, ROI is still seen as the benchmark to measure performance. Even though the numbers can be manipulated, it justifies expenses and thus fuels growth. Simply put, without bang for your buck, your business will fizzle. Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Samxmeg ',\n",
       " ' Valve completed its weeklong trilogy of announcements Friday, revealing the Steam Controller that\\'s intended to \"bridge the gap from the desk to the living room.\"  The dual-trackpad controller with a touchscreen in the center — which is capatible with older, current and upcoming games on all versions of Steam — piggybacks on the Valve\\'s two previous announcements this week. The company revealed SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system that allows Windows and Mac games to be streamed from a computer to a TV; and Steam Machines, Valve\\'s hardware for living room gaming.  See also: These 20 Game GIFs Just Ain\\'t Right \"We\\'ve fooled those older games into thinking they\\'re being played with a keyboard and mouse,\" Valve said in its announcement.  \"Whole genres of games that were previously only playable with a keyboard and mouse are now accessible from the sofa,\" Valve added. \"In addition, games like first-person shooters that are designed around precise aiming within a large visual field now benefit from the trackpads’ high resolution and absolute position control.\" The symmetrical controller has 16 buttons. Valve emphasized that its touchscreen is designed to let players keep their attention on the TV screen. When they\\'re using the touchscreen, it appears as an overlay on top of the game on the TV screen.   The controller has a \"legacy mode\" that converts it into keyboard-and-mouse mode so gamers \"can use the configuration tool to create and share bindings for their favorite games\" and then \"choose from a list of the most popular configurations.\" The controller, for now, is available in beta as part of the Steam Box beta pool, which players can sign up for by Oct. 25.

The Walking Dead   Based on the graphic novels that inspired the record-breaking television series, The Walking Dead surrounds a new group of characters in the same zombie-infested world.

       " ' This must be the scariest lost and found ever. Officials are investigating how a handful of decades-old vials of smallpox made their way to an unused portion of a storage room at an FDA laboratory in Bethesda, Maryland. See also: Bill Gates: Satellites and GPS Are Fighting Polio The vials, which the CDC says appear to date from the 1950s, were immediately secured in a containment facility in Bethesda before they were sent to the CDC’s high-containment facility in Atlanta. The vials are now being tested to determine if the virus is still “viable” — meaning if it has the ability to grow in tissue culture. The six glass vials of freeze-dried virus were intact and sealed with melted glass, and the virus may well have been dead, because it wasn\\'t kept cold over the years, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  The smallpox virus.Image: CDC/Associated Press\"We don\\'t yet know if it\\'s live and infectious. It\\'s possible it could be inactivated because of long length of storage,\" said Stephan Monroe, deputy director of the CDC center that handles highly dangerous infectious agents. A government scientist found the vials while cleaning out the storage room at the lab, which is on the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health. The CDC\\'s Atlanta facility is one of two World Health Organization-designated repositories for smallpox. The other is the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) in Novosibirsk, Russia. The virus, which killed 300 million to 500 million people during the 20th century, was declared eradicated in 1979. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, was the last person to die of the disease in 1978.  A man who contracted small pox is shown with a formation of scar-producing pustules on his body in 1941.“There is no evidence that any of the vials labeled variola has been breached, and onsite biosafety personnel have not identified any infectious exposure risk to lab workers or the public,” the CDC says in a statement. “CDC has notified WHO about the discovery, and WHO has been invited to participate in the investigation. If viable smallpox is present, WHO will be invited to witness the destruction of these smallpox materials, as has been the precedent for other cases where smallpox samples have been found outside of the two official repositories,” it said. Officials said this is the first time that unaccounted-for smallpox has been discovered. It was the second recent incident in which a government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous germ. Last month, a laboratory safety lapse at the CDC in Atlanta led the agency to give scores of employees antibiotics as a precaution against anthrax. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

       " ' The smartwatch space is starting to get pretty crowded. From Sony to Samsung to Qualcomm, wearables are hot. But you can\\'t talk about smartwatches without mentioning the Pebble. After raising more than $10 million on Kickstarter, Pebble has now sold more than 250,000 units. See also: Pebble Smart Watch Delivers on Kickstarter Promise and More Out of the box, you can get plenty done with your Pebble. You can answer phone calls, receive phone notifications and even control your music on your wrist. With the addition of watch faces and third party apps, however, Pebble becomes even more robust. We\\'ve compiled some tips, tricks and apps that will help you make the most out of the Pebble smartwatch. Upgrade to the Latest Firmware  The latest Pebble update includes long-awaited full notification support for iOS 7. That means every notification you get on your iPhone (or Android device) will also push its way onto the Pebble. In iOS 7, you\\'ll need to make sure that the notifications for a given app are in \"banner mode.\" The net result is a huge jump in functionality for iOS users because all of your notifications \"just work.\" Bluetooth LE mode is now activated in Pebble for iOS as well, which means should mean less battery drain. Consider Upgrading Early to Pebble 2.0 Although the latest update is a big deal, the real fun is coming with Pebble 2.0. The promise of Pebble 2.0, especially for apps, is immense because the new SDK lets developers take advantage of more components on the device (such as the accelerometer), as well as access to stuff like persistent storage and dynamic memory. For end users, the biggest change is that Pebble 2.0 will let apps and watchfaces pull in data from sources across the web without necessarily needing a separate companion app running on the phone. This will allow developers to build apps that are more phone-agnostic, which means you won\\'t have to check to see if you can only use a certain app or watchface on iOS or Android. The Pebble 2.0 firmware is currently in beta and is expected to ship to everyone by the end of the year. If you can\\'t wait for Pebble 2.0 and want to try out some of the enhanced apps and watchfaces, you can download the firmware to your watch early. Just follow the instructions on the getting started page to download the latest version of the Pebble app for iOS or Android, as well as the beta firmware for Pebble 2.0. Most of the watchfaces and apps we mention will work with Pebble 1.0. Increasingly, however, Pebble developers are upgrading their setups to support Pebble 2.0 and some apps only support Pebble 2.0. Update: Downloading the Pebble 2.0 iOS app now requires manual approval from the Pebble team, so this might just be for Android users for now. A word of warning: Pebble 2.0 is still in beta. In my tests, I\\'ve found it to be fairly stable, but you should expect some bugs and occasional crashes. If you\\'re leery about installing a firmware update early, wait for the official release. Grab Some Watchfaces and Apps In the world of Pebble, there are a number of different apps. They include:  Stand-alone watchface apps Apps or watchfaces that require a third-party app on iOS or Android to run Third-party apps that also have Pebble functionality  Basic watchfaces are the most common type of Pebble app. In the early days of Pebble development, many of these faces were primarily about design and style, rather than adding additional functionality. Over time, developers figured out methods of creating a companion app for iOS or Android, that could act as a way to pull in additional data. Starting with Pebble 2.0, many of those watchfaces will no longer require a third-party companion app, because the standard Pebble application will be able support JavaScript calls. The second type of apps run on your iOS or Android phone, but let you toggle and control information via the Pebble watchface. We\\'ll talk more about those below. Right now this is where some of the most exciting developments within the Pebble ecosystem are taking place. The third type of app are typical iOS or Android apps, such as RunKeeper, that also have built-in hooks to support Pebble. Right now, the number of apps with built-in Pebble support is limited, but Pebble will be rolling out big-name apps, including GoPro, Yelp and Foursquare later this year. Finding Apps and Watchfaces You can find watchfaces at a few sites, including MyPebbleFaces.com and PebbleBarn.com. You can also find watchfaces in the Pebble forums. One of the only challenges with finding watchfaces and apps is that the apps need to be installed from your phone, and depending on the source of the app, it may not be that easy to browse on a small screen. Pebble says it has plans for a better way of finding and installing apps, but until we see an official app store, there are a number of third-party apps that serve as mobile front-ends for the Pebble community. On iOS, the MyPebbleFaces app that makes installing and browsing watchfaces from the iPhone, much, much easier. You can sign-in with your MyPebbleFaces account to access favorited apps, which means you can browse on the desktop and then install on your phone. Likewise, on Android you can use Pebble Apps as a way to browse Pebble-compatible apps in Google Play and in third-party stores. Want to create your own watchface? Be sure to check out the Watchface Generator for Pebble, now also available for Pebble 2.0. This website makes it easy for regular users to create their own watchfaces, directly from the web browser. Great Watchface Apps for Pebble  \\xa0 Here are a few of our favorite watchfaces for Pebble 1.0: Note: For watchfaces that integrate local weather, you\\'ll need to have an app that supports the httpebble protocol such as Pebbler for Android or httpebble for iOS installed. Some enhancement apps such as Smartwatch+ for Pebble and Smartwatch Pro for Pebble also include httpebble support.  Futura Weather 2 — My personal favorite watchface. With httpebble, you get the weather too! Simplicity Plus — A slight modification to the standard Simplicity watchface. 91 Weather — A digital watchface similar to Futura Weather Mac System 3 — Classic Mac OS on your wrist. Mario Time — It\\'s always time for Mario to be on your wrist. Heisenberg — Walter White. Need we say more?  Pebble 2.0 is in beta and we already have a few favorite new watchfaces:  Pebble Mars [direct Pebble app link] — Pulls in photos from the Mars Rover Noms — This is an animated watchface that \"noms\" each minute. Stopwatch, Countdown, Yacht Race Start Timer and Watch — This is a great stopwatch/timer/countdown watchface that also tells time. Simple Day, Date, and Time — As it says on the tin. Plex Remote — You can use your watch to control your Plex HTPC client.  Get an Enhancement App for Connected Watchfaces In addition to watchfaces that exist primarily to tell time, there is another class of Pebble apps that offers users more control over their phone and can also push out more information. Some of these apps are for a specific purpose — say travel, transit or dealing with a to-do list. Others are more general-purpose and can offer up a wealth of utility and functionality. Android Enhancement Apps Glance For Pebble  Glance for Pebble is one of the best Pebble enhancement apps we\\'ve seen. Not only does it show the time, date and weather, it can also show off how many unread email messages you have, your unread SMS count, missed calls and calendar entries. It can even be configured to show off a stock ticker. It also integrates with Android automation-app Tasker, has calendar integration and more. My favorite part of the app is that you can even do quick replies to an SMS message directly from the Pebble. You select the recipient and you can choose a predefined message to reply with. So if you frequently text \"lol\" or need to have a quick way to say \"running late\" — without pulling out your phone, just configure the quick-reply message in the Glance for Pebble Android app and then select that reply as an option on your phone. There are even third-party Glance watchfaces that make Glance look even better. A Pebble 2.0-compatible Glance watchface [direct Pebble link] is also available. Music Boss for Pebble  MusicBoss takes Pebble\\'s control of your music player to the next level. You can adjust the volume on your phone while listening to music, launch your current music app directly from the watch and even change what music app you\\'re using from Pebble. Music Boss also integrates with Glance and Tasker. Music Boss also has a Pebble 2.0-compatible watchface [direct Pebble link] Pebble Rocker Pebble Rocker lets you control your phone\\'s camera, browse Facebook, check-in to Foursquare, calculate tips and browse your Twitter timeline. You can also use Pebble Rocker to find your phone (provided it\\'s within range of Bluetooth) if it goes missing. Notification Center for Pebble Notification Center for Pebble is an Android app that replaces the standard notification system with a new, more robust system. The app allows you to display notifications from all apps, dismiss notifications directly from Pebble (Android 4.3 and higher), view your notifications and even switch between multiple notification screens. You can do really nerdy stuff with your notifications with this apps as well. If you have become frustrated with some of the limitations of the built-in notification system, give Notification Center for Pebble a try. Pebble Adventure Pebble Adventure is still in beta but it brings turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps to your Pebble. Watch Trigger for Pebble  \\xa0 Watch Trigger for Pebble requires Pebble 2.0 but lets you use your Pebble to take photos and also create timed shots. Canvas for Pebble Canvas for Pebble lets you create Pebble watchfaces on your Android device. The developer is currently updating the app to work with Pebble 2.0, but you can create Pebble 1.0-compatible watchfaces directly from the app. iOS Enhancement Apps Pebble-compatible apps on iOS have really started to come into their own. Thanks to iOS 7\\'s ability for apps to run in the background, developers can create apps that do more than ever on Pebble, and this includes enhancement and companion apps. Smartwatch+ for Pebble \\xa0 \\xa0 If Glance is the gold standard on Android, then Smartwatch+ is the current front-runner on iOS. It\\'s $2.99 and it works on iOS and Android. The app lets you access a bunch of different parts of your phone — including the weather, your calendar and your camera — all from within its interface. You can pull in stock info, Bitcoin prices, your reminders, even launch your camera. It also lets you pull in GPS coordinates. In addition to viewing these items on Pebble, Smartwatch+ for Pebble comes with a watchface of sorts, dubbed SmartStatus, that lets you view the time, weather, your upcoming calendar appointments and the status of your battery. As a bonus, it includes httpebble, which means you can use it with httpebble-compatible watchfaces without having to install another app on your iPhone. Both Smartwatch+ [direct Pebble link] and SmartStatus [direct Pebble link] are compatible with Pebble 2.0. Smartwatch Pro for Pebble At $3.99, Smartwatch Pro for Pebble isn\\'t as feature-rich as Smartwatch+ for Pebble, but it has a few features that make it unique — namely support for Twitter. You can also control what calendar you want to see (or not see) on your Pebble, as well as your location. The developer says he\\'s updating the app to better work with iOS 7. A Pebble 2.0 version of its watchface [direct Pebble link] is also available. PebbleNav For $3.99, PebbleNav offers a way to have full walking or cycling directions on your Pebble. You can create you route in the app and it will show you each step on the watchface. It will even buzz when you need to take a turn. PebbGPS  At $0.99, PebbGPS is another navigation app that offers turn-by-turn walking or driving directions. You can also view maps from a terrain, satellite, hybrid or streetmap view. PebbleCam  At $2.99, PebbleCam is more than just a glorified camera launcher, it also acts as a remote viewfinder for your iPhone\\'s camera. The quality of the image obviously isn\\'t great — and there is latency — but it\\'s great for knowing if you\\'ve got a general shot correct or not. What makes this better than some of the other camera remotes is that it lets you choose the rear or front camera on the iPhone and toggle flash on or off. The Pebble 2.0 version of the app includes support for taking a photo just by shaking your wrist. PebCiti This is a particularly cool app for NYC users. It\\'s an iOS app and watchface that will show you the closest available Citi bike to your location. Make it Pretty  No one wants a watch that looks exactly the same. Make your Pebble stand out with some inexpensive accessories. The strap the Pebble comes with is fine, but if you want something wider — in another color — or maybe out of leather, that can change the look of your watch. The Pebble uses a standard 22mm watch band, which means you can buy one to better fit your needs. Want to give your Pebble a splash of color? GadgetWraps makes high-quality stickers for Pebble that fit the watch perfectly and look really, really great. I got a GadgetWrap in white after refusing to wait for my original white Pebble to ship. The end result was nearly indistinguishable from a legit white version. You can also mix and match colors by getting stickers for the Pebble buttons. Because these are stickers, you don\\'t have to worry about messing up your Pebble if you decide to go for another look down the line. This is Just the Beginning When I first reviewed the Pebble, I wrote about the potential of the Pebble and the wearables category as a whole. We\\'re already starting to see the fruits of some of that potential with the Pebble 2.0 SDK and the myriad of apps and watchfaces that developers are building for the platform.

       " ' UNITED NATIONS — Were those Ukrainians killed by snipers in Kiev last month victims of then-President Viktor Yanukovych? Hopes of finding an answer to this question were complicated today when leaked audio of a 10-minute conversation between the European Union\\'s High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton and Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet was put on YouTube. In the conversation, Paet recounts that while in Kiev he was told by prospective new Health Minister Olga Bogomolets that \"all evidence shows the people [were] killed by snipers, among police and people from the streets, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides.\" (Bogomolets, described as the \"Mother Theresa of the Maidan,\" also appeared on BBC.) In the audio, the EU\\'s Ashton claimed, \"We do want to investigate.\"  See also: 9 Essential Questions About Ukraine, Answered So what do the UN\\'s Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson, UN envoy Robert Serry who was forced out of Crimea today after threats, and UN human rights official Ivan Simonovic, all have to say about this? Will Simonovic, dispatched to Ukraine by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, actually investigate who was calling the snipers\\' shots? Ban Ki-moon\\'s outgoing spokesperson Martin Nesirky said the details of Mr. Simonovic’s planned mission were still being worked out. \"But,\" he added, \"the remit is to look into a broad range of allegations and to simply take stock, to try to understand across the entire spectrum, from the west of the country to the east of the country and to the southeast. So, this is going to be a broad-ranging mission. I would not say it is an investigation. It’s a fact-finding mission.\" Simonovic is the New York representative of outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, and is widely viewed as campaigning to take over Pillay\\'s post. Could this fact finding mission to Ukraine be Simonovic\\'s try out, to see if he can deliver the report the majority of UN Security Council members want? Might absolving Yanukovych of the snipers hurt Simonovic\\'s chances of promotion? When Mashable on Wednesday asked Nesirky if Simonovic will investigate these claims, Nesirky insisted that the UN does not comment on leaked audio. \"There is no reference to the United Nations in what you have mentioned, and so that’s the reason I am not going to comment on it. But, where there are allegations made within Kiev, when Mr. Simonovic arrives there, I am sure that this is something that would be part of what he is looking at,\" he said. But the UN did comment on a previously leaked conversation, also about Ukraine, in which US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland bragged how former U.S. now UN official Jeffrey Feltman \"got\" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to send envoy Robert Serry to Ukraine. If only to deny that Ban\\'s UN is dominated by the U.S., the UN commented and claimed it was unclear if the \"Jeff\" referred to by Nuland was in fact Jeff Feltman, or US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoff Pyatt, or even some other Jeff. The strange case of the two — or three — Jeffs was left unresolved. But isn\\'t who killed whom a key human rights question of the type the UN should investigate, if it investigates anything at all? Estonia, for its part, is investigating how the conversation was intercepted and put on YouTube — a technology and cyber-security question. While US Secretary of State John Kerry accuses Russia of reviving or retreating into the Cold War in Ukraine, and State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki has called the leaks \"a new low in Russian tradecraft,\" the speed and venue of leaks has been decidedly 21st century. A key question going forward is whether this near real-time audio leaks will spread beyond Ukraine to other conflicts, from Syria or the Middle East Peace Process to Congo, Mali and the Central African Republic. The rhetoric may be old — but the technology and tactics are new. ',\n",

       " ' Amazon is reportedly in the early phases of testing a new delivery service that would reduce the company\\'s reliance on UPS and FedEx. The company has been testing the service, supposedly called \"Last Mile,\" in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco since late last year, The Wall Street Journal report says. See also: What the World’s Biggest Websites Looked Like at Launch The exact logistics of the delivery service, or when it might roll out in other cities, aren\\'t yet clear but it focuses on the so-called \"last mile\" of deliveries, the part that ends up at your doorstep and is typically handled by large carriers like UPS or the USPS. Packages shipped through the network are reportedly marked \"AMZL\" and \"AMZN_US,\" Amazon\\'s internal codes for packages slated to be delivered through the service. The WSJ report pointed to recent job listings, posted on Amazon\\'s website, that suggest the company is attempting to directly compete with FedEx and UPS. Amazon is growing at a faster speed than UPS and FedEx, who are responsible for shipping the majority of our packages. At this rate Amazon cannot continue to rely solely on the solutions provided through traditional logistics providers. To do so will limit our growth, increase costs and impede innovation in delivery capabilities. Last Mile is the solution to this. It is a program which is going to revolutionize how shipments are delivered to millions of customers. Thursday\\'s report is the latest in Amazon\\'s plans to make its delivery services faster and more competitive. The company has already rolled out a similar delivery service in the UK, which Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted in a letter to shareholders earlier this year.  \"We’ve created our own fast, last-mile delivery networks in the UK where commercial carriers couldn’t support our peak volumes,\" he wrote.  In December, Bezos unveiled plans for Amazon Prime Air, expected to debut in 2015, a service that will use flying robotic drones to deliver packages within minutes of orders being placed.  ',\n",

Jolie and Pitt were engaged in April 2012 and began dating in 2005, after meeting on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith.   The relationship began as a Hollywood scandal, after \"Brangelina\" began their relationship while Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston. Aniston and Pitt divorced in October 2005, ending a five-year marriage.  The couple have six children together; three adopted children: Maddox, Pax and Zahara; and three biological children: Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne.

       " '  What makes Connor Levy, a baby born on May 18, special is that his genome was sequenced for abnormalities before he was born — meaning the doctors examined him as an embryo to ensure he would have healthy cells.  The process of gene sequencing is usually expensive and available at many IVF (in vitro fertilization) clinics. In Connor’s case, it was accomplished through next-generation sequencing (NGS), which may become a low-cost alternative.  SEE ALSO: 8 Babies Named After the Internet and Tech  DNA is a relatively large molecule that consists of a chain of bases called nucleotides and DNA sequencing is the process through which we understand the precise sequence of these bases in some DNA. Early versions of commercial DNA sequencing methods looked at the entire strand of DNA from one base to the next, step by step. NGS is comprised of a new set of methods that don\\'t go from top to bottom. Instead, researchers split up the strand into many parts, and then process all of them in parallel. Once that\\'s done, the results are put back together. NGS could help doctors at IVF clinics choose which embryos are the healthiest and have the highest chance for successful pregnancy with the mother. In Connor\\'s case, as part of a clinical trial, doctors looked at cells from 5 day-old embryos and examined their chromosomes to determine which had the best chance of growing into a healthy baby.  This technology could provide useful insights for families choosing to have children later via IVF. The chances of producing an embryo with the wrong number of chromosomes rises with age, the University of Oxford\\'s Dagan Wells told New Scientist. Women in their 20s might have one in 10 embryos with the wrong number of chromosomes, whereas women in their 30s or 40s may produce 25% or 75% abnormal embryos, respectively.  The idea is to increase the chance of pregnancy and reduce the number of miscarriages by selecting the healthiest embryos. Researchers do admit that this process could also open the door for some non-medical uses, however, such as so-called \"designer babies,\" creating a need for regulatory processes.

A key part of the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as \"Obamacare,\" is that people would be able to shop for insurance through easy-to-use websites. Most states make use of a centralized national online marketplace, Healthcare.gov, while 16 states and the District of Columbia use location-specific sites. The only problem is that Healthcare.gov isn\\'t working properly. See also: Obamacare Explained: How to Use the Internet for Health Care In attempt to ease the frustration of those who haven\\'t been able to sign up, and to quiet critics of the healthcare law, the president gave something of a tech support session from the White House lawn Monday.  Since the website isn\\'t working optimally, Obama told people they could sign up for insurance plans the old-fashioned way — over the phone or in person. He twice read the phone number people can call for support (it\\'s 1-800-318-2596), and reported that wait times were less than one minute on average. \"Nobody is madder than me that the website isn\\'t working the way it should, which means it\\'s going to get fixed,\" Obama said.  The first week Healthcare.gov was live, just 36,000 people managed to use it to enroll for a plan out of the 3.7 million who attempted to register, according to a blog post by web traffic analysis company Compete.  \"There\\'s no sugarcoating it,\" Obama said. \"The website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process.\" The Affordable Healthcare online marketplaces have experienced performance problems since their Oct. 1 launch. Healthcare.gov has had nearly 20 million visitors during the past three weeks, according to Obama, who said high demand is a large part of what\\'s causing the problems: \"People are rushing to see what\\'s available.\" He said the government has \"experts from some of America\\'s top private sector tech companies\" helping solve the problems. Though it\\'s by far the biggest issue, usability isn\\'t the only controversy regarding Healthcare.gov.

       " ' When Chinese hackers breached Google servers in 2010, they were not targeting the Gmail accounts of human rights activists, as the company claimed at the time.  What the hackers were actually after was a database containing years of sensitive information related to U.S. surveillance. Now we have learned that the attack was successful, and the data compromised.  In 2010, as part of what has been dubbed as Operation Aurora, Chinese hackers gained access to a database of data relating to thousands of surveillance orders, all judicial responses to agency requests for email monitoring.  Those orders were issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allows the feds to spy on foreign communications (and American targets who communicate with foreign suspects). This startling revelation was first reported by the online security website CIO on April 22, but confirmed by anonymous sources to the Washington Post Monday. It\\'s unclear exactly what information the database contained. We also don\\'t know how much data the hackers got their hands on. But the U.S. officials interviewed by the Post said it was \"valuable intelligence.\"  That the attacks were part of a larger counter-intelligence operation had been an unconfirmed rumor for years. Google refused to confirm it  for the Post article.  But senior U.S. officials did confirm it, explaining how important this information could have been for the Chinese government, and how sensitive it was for its American counterpart. \"Knowing that you were subjects of an investigation allows them to take steps to destroy information, get people out of the country,\" one former anonymous official told the Post. He speculated that the the Chinese might have wanted to deceive U.S. spies by feeding them false information.  David Aucsmith, senior director of Microsoft’s Institute for Advanced Technology in Governments, revealed in April that Microsoft had been a target during Operation Aurora as well. They found the hackers \"were actually looking for the accounts that we had lawful wiretap orders on,\" he said. After Hiatus, Chinese Hackers Take Aim at U.S. Targets For security experts, this is a disturbing revelation with far-reaching implications. \"I think the fact that the public has been kept in the dark about the extent of the attack is really problematic,\" says Chris Soghoian, a technologist and advocate at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It\\'s troubling that it took three years for the public to learn this.\" \"This is why wiretapping systems are a bad idea,\" tweeted Matthew Green, a cryptography researcher and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \"Not because they can\\'t be built securely; because they won\\'t be.\"  This is why many security experts are concerned about an FBI plan to mandate backdoors into online communications. The plan would allow them to wiretap online chats. It\\'s part of a rumored overhaul of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law that mandates similar wiretap requirements for phone calls.  \"Google has hundreds of engineers doing nothing but security,\" Soghoian told Mashable. \"If Google can not protect its databases against the Chinese government, if they cannot protect their wiretapping system, what makes us think that a smaller company with less resources is going to be able to defend itself?\" Image via Keith Bedford/Bloomberg via Getty Images ',\n",

       " ' In what may be a critical breakthrough for creating artificial organs, Harvard researchers say they have created tissue interlaced with blood vessels. Using a custom-built four-head 3D printer and a \"disappearing\" ink, materials scientist Jennifer Lewis and her team created a patch of tissue containing skin cells and biological structural material interwoven with blood-vessel-like structures. Reported by the team in Advanced Materials, the tissue is the first made through 3D printing to include potentially functional blood vessels embedded among multiple, patterned cell types. In recent years, researchers have made impressive progress in building tissues and organ-like structures in the lab. Thin artificial tissues, such as a trachea grown from a patient\\'s own cells, are already being used to treat patients (see \"Manufacturing Organs\"). In other more preliminary examples, scientists have shown that specific culture conditions can push stem cells to grow into self-organized structures resembling a developing brain, a bit of a liver, or part of an eye (see \"Researchers Grow 3D Human Brain Tissues,\" \"A Rudimentary Liver Is Grown from Stem Cells,\" and \"Growing Eyeballs\"). But no matter the method of construction, all regenerative projects have run up against the same wall when trying to build thicker and more complex tissues: a lack of blood vessels. Lewis\\'s group solved the problem by creating hollow, tube-like structures within a mesh of printed cells using an \"ink\" that liquefies as it cools. The tissue is built by the 3D printer in layers. A gelatin-based ink acts as extracellular matrix — the structural mix of proteins and other biological molecules that surrounds cells in the body. Two other inks contained the gelatin material and either mouse or human skin cells. All these inks are viscous enough to maintain their structure after being laid down by the printer. A third ink with counterintuitive behavior helped the team create the hollow tubes. This ink has a Jell-O-like consistency at room temperature, but when cooled it liquefies. The team printed tracks of this ink amongst the others. After chilling the patch of printed tissue, the researchers applied a light vacuum to remove the special ink, leaving behind empty channels within the structure. Then cells that normally line blood vessels in the body can be infused into the channels. Building actual replacement tissues or organs for patients is a distant goal, but one the team is already weighing. \"We think it\\'s a very foundational step, and we think it\\'s going to be essential toward organ printing or regeneration,\" says Lewis, who is member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. The smallest channels printed were about 75 micrometers in diameter, which is much larger than the tiny capillaries that exchange nutrients and waste throughout the body. The hope is that the 3D printing method will set the overall architecture of blood vessels within artificial tissue and then smaller blood vessels will develop along with the rest of the tissue. \"We view this as a method to print the larger vessels; then we want to harness biology to do the rest of the work,\" says Lewis.

       " ' When fur protests reached their heyday in the 1980s and \\'90s, both celebrities and citizens shirked the unpopular trend. However, there\\'s no denying that the luxurious material has experienced a renaissance in the new millennium. Fur sales skyrocketed 70% in the early 2000s, hitting a worldwide record of $15 billion in sales in 2007. Enter #MakeFurHistory, an innovative, new campaign battling the international fur industry. Launched in October, the initiative includes a \"fake\" website, FurDiscounts.com. This ecommerce site lures would-be fur buyers, and then disrupts the buying process, as visitors are redirected to MakeFurHistory.com, the official website for this anti-fur campaign. The site details the wrongdoings of the fur industry, focused on the maltreatment of animals; more than 100 animals are killed each year, the majority of which are killed in fur farms. LUSH COSMETICS — a UK-based cosmetics line that famously avoids animal testing and opts to test products on human volunteers — was drawn to the campaign for its unique, inventive nature. In addition to participating with #MakeFurHistory, LUSH will also update its store windows to showcase the overall message and will let customers ditch old furs in exchange for one of LUSH’s vegan goodies. The cosmetics line is joined in support of this campaign by the Montreal SCPA and the Association for the Protection of Fur Bearing Animals. Image: LUSH Cosmetics  This campaign is innovative in the way it targets fur consumers: By catching them red-handed, directly in the act of fur shopping. LUSH believes most shoppers purchase fur as a fashion statement, without understanding the reality of the industry. And unfortunately, there is little to no legislation in either the United States or Canada that protects the animals. The hope is that by informing people at the right time, consumers will pledge never to buy or wear fur again. The #MakeFurHistory hashtag is hoping to start a global social media movement, and there’s already been a groundswell of support for the campaign. Hordes of organizations, companies and individuals are actively sharing the campaign message, and LUSH shoppers across the globe (we’ll embed a Tweet here) are showing up in support of the cause. Viewers are also commenting on the unique approach – because who doesn’t love a good hoax? The LUSH team has also created a video revealing the campaign and its accompanying stunt. Watch the video and share it out with #MakeFurHistory on your social channels, and be sure to visit the site at FurDiscounts.com to see this innovative campaign at work.  ',\n",

The professional daredevil completed a quarter-mile crossing of an offshoot of the Grand Canyon on Sunday, with one small catch: he was on a tightrope 1,500 feet above the canyon floor. NBD, right?  SEE ALSO: Daredevil Survives Mount Everest BASE Jump  Wallenda\\'s feat took 22 minutes and 54 seconds to complete, according to Reuters, and not surprisingly set the social web abuzz.

The stunt was broadcast live by the Discovery Channel, while cameras attached to his body gave the rest of us a Wallenda\\'s-eye-view of the madness.

       " ' In the second part of its cryptic announcement series, Valve Software announced it is creating its own hardware for living room gaming — called Steam Machines — and is asking 300 Steam users to beta test the products it currently has in development. Valve did not reveal anything about the Steam Machines, only that several different models exist, all designed for gamers to enjoy PC gaming through their television. See also: The 10 Most Popular PC Games in China \"Entertainment is not a one-size-fits-all world. We want you to be able to choose the hardware that makes sense for you, so we are working with multiple partners to bring a variety of Steam gaming machines to market during 2014, all of them running SteamOS,\" the announcement page said. On Monday, Valve announced SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system designed to allow players to stream games on televisions. It will work on Steam Machines and also be available for third parties to build hardware around. There are around 3,000 games on Steam right now, and Valve said hundreds of them are already compatible with its new operating system, but the list hasn\\'t been revealed. Steam users can sign up to be in the Steam Box beta pool by completing five steps by Oct. 25. On that day, the pool will be closed and users will be notified if they\\'ve been selected. The five steps are:  Join the Steam Universe community group Agree to the Steam Hardware Beta Terms and Conditions Make 10 Steam friends (if you haven\\'t already) Create a public Steam Community profile (if you haven\\'t already) Play a game using a gamepad in Big Picture mode  Beta users will receive their Steam Machines by the end of the year, according to Valve, and retail versions will be out in 2014. There has been speculation for years that secretive Valve Software was planning on entering the hardware business. The company still has one more announcement related to SteamOS and the Steam Machine; its cryptic website said it will come at Friday at 1 p.m. ET. Image: Valve Software ',\n",

       " '     Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son has made no secret of his desire to create the biggest company in the world, and in a new interview with Charlie Rose, the Japanese tech mogul hints that T-Mobile may be next on his acquisition list. With the acquisition of Sprint in his rear view mirror, Son, now chairman of Sprint, believes he needs more scale in the United States to compete with the likes of AT&T and Verizon.  See also: T-Mobile 2013: The Comeback Carrier When pressed directly by Rose as to whether or not he has already made an agreement to acquire T-Mobile, Son was coy, saying, \"I don\\'t know. We have to give it a shot … We would like to make a deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out.\"  Rumors of a Sprint merger with T-Mobile have floated for months, with some reports hinting that a formal offer might be on the table in the first half of 2014.  A merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would put the combined wireless carrier on equal footing with the other two heavyweights in the U.S., which is exactly what Son wants. \"We need a certain scale,\" Son said. \"But once we have enough scale to have a level fight, a three-heavyweight fight, I would like to have a real fight, not a pseudo fight. If I could have a real fight, I would go for a massive price war — a technology war. I would go for price competition very aggressively, and network competition to create the world\\'s best network.\" Son outlined some of the details of his vision to conquer the U.S. mobile market in a presentation on Tuesday, titled \"The Promise of Mobile Internet in Driving American Innovation, the Economy and Education.\"  But what about company culture? If the merger does come to pass, will T-Mobile\\'s recent high-profile swipes at its competitors sit well with Son, an entrepreneur raised in the conservative confines of Japan Inc.?  The truth is that while T-Mobile\\'s current colorful CEO, John Legere, might seem like a potentially odd fit to lead a Son-controlled T-Mobile/Sprint venture, Son himself is actually considered something of a wildcard maverick back in Japan. A quick study of Softbank\\'s domestic price wars and early fight to become the first carrier to bring the iPhone to Japan reveals that Son and Legere might turn out to be a perfect match.  During the interview, Son would not reveal what stage the talks with T-Mobile have reached, if any, but industry watchers are expecting an offer to be presented sometime soon.  If the bootstrapped telecom mogul who successfully took on Japan\\'s biggest wireless players years ago can pull the U.S. merger off, it would put him one step toward his stated goal of becoming the \"world\\'s biggest company — by all measures, whether by sales, profit, or market cap.\" Doubling down on those sentiments, Son told Rose, \"I want to be No. 1.\" The full interview with Rose has not yet been released online, but you check out two brief snippets in the videos above.  UPDATE, March 11, 7:30 p.m. ET:The full interview is now available on the Charlie Rose show website.  ',\n",

       " ' KEENE, N.H. — Violent disturbances near Keene State College during an annual pumpkin festival lasted until early Sunday, and involved dozens of arrests and injuries, as well as police in riot gear using tear gas to disperse crowds. Keene State student Ellery Murray told The Boston Globe that she was at a party Saturday that had drawn a large crowd when people started throwing things. “There were about 4,000 kids in this backyard, and it almost felt like a war zone,” Murray said. “People were just throwing everything they could find — rocks, skateboards, buckets, pumpkins. It was actually kind of scary.” See also: 21 Pumpkins That Were Carved Into Failure The parties around the school coincided with the annual Keene Pumpkin Festival, where the community tries to set a world record of the largest number of carved and lighted jack-o-lanterns in one place. WMUR-TV in Manchester showed video of a crowd overturning a car, people running from tear gas clouds, street signs being torn down and fires burning in the streets. Police, who dressed in riot gear and ordered crowds to disperse, also investigated reports of people throwing glass bottles and fireworks, jumping off a roof and banging on cars. One group of young people threatened to beat up an elderly man, and another resident heard someone \"threatening to kill officers,\" according to the Keene Police Department log, which shows 235 calls between 2:30 a.m. Friday and 3:30 a.m. Sunday and at least 49 arrests. Not all were part of the disturbances, but at least 14 on Saturday and early Sunday appeared related to the unruly behavior. Most involved disorderly conduct or alcohol-related offenses. At least 30 people were injured near the school before evening Saturday, and 20 of them were taken to hospitals, Keene Fire Chief Mark Howard told New England Cable News. Gov. Maggie Hassan said state and local safety officials worked to defuse what she called \"the situation.\" Hassan also told WMUR why police were wearing riot gear: \"When you have a situation of a large crowd with both bonfires and projectiles being thrown, it\\'s important that law enforcement be in protective gears so that we can minimize injuries to them so that they can minimize injuries in the crowd — and that certainly was the approach they took. I am grateful that there weren\\'t more injuries, but there certainly are injuries this morning and possibly a couple pretty serious ones.\" College officials provided few specifics on the melee, but said Keene State students and out-of-town visitors were involved.  College President Anne Huot said in an emailed statement that the festival has been promoted by others \"as a destination for destructive and raucous behavior,\" and the college had tried working with the city and campus to prevent unruly conduct. \"We deplore the actions of those whose only purpose was to cause mayhem,\" she said, adding that the students involved will be held accountable.

       " ' Nest is about to turn all the data its thousands of Nest Protect owners have been delivering into some tangible new features. Since launching the $99 smart home smoke and carbon monoxide detector late last year, a follow-up to its popular Learning Thermostat, Nest, which is owned by Google, has been collecting anonymized data from hundreds of thousands of installed units in the U.S., Canada and the UK. Now the company has a handful of updates, all bundled into a Nest Protect 2.0 software update that was built in direct response to that data-driven learning. See also: Picking Sides: Will You Live in an Apple or Google Smart Home? It\\'s a bit of good news after the company decided to first temporarily stop selling Nest Protect in the spring when it found that its key convenience feature, the ability to wave away a false alarm, could be triggered accidentally. The product, which was never actually recalled, eventually went back on sale, but the wave feature is gone and there are no signs it\\'s coming back. One exec did tell Mashable that Nest is \"still working on finding the best way to silence nuisance alarms.\" Like the now-departed wave feature, Nest Protect\\'s new ones primarily leverage existing hardware and sensors. The updates The new Steam Check addresses a problem that, at least according to Nest, affects 15% of all homes: smoke alarms sounding off because of steam, like the hefty amount that comes wafting out of your lengthy showers. The Nest Protect update solves this by turning on the built-in humidity sensor and combining measurements from it with those coming from the device\\'s smoke chamber, which measures smoke by whether or not it can detect the light from an LED at the other end of the chamber (more smoke or steam, less light). This should cut down on 50% of all nuisance steam alarms. Nest won\\'t go further than 50%, though, because, as a safety device, it cannot afford to be wrong. Nest Protect also reads carbon monoxide levels. While the current software will notify you when the levels of this odorless and invisible gas reach dangerous levels, the updated software will now let you know what\\'s happening with CO levels over time. In other words, you can see if you\\'ve been exposed to lower levels for days or weeks, which may be less dangerous in the short term, but potentially harmful over time.

       " ' In recent weeks, Israel has shelled Gaza with missiles and sent ground troops into the strip to root out the militant group Hamas.  So far, more than 800 Palestinians have been killed, many of them civilians, and at least 36 Israelis have been killed, most of them soldiers — sparking a debate about the civilian toll, and the price paid especially by children. See also: \\'Am I Going to Die, Daddy?\\' The Child in Gaza Asked In part, this lopsided casualty rate is a function of the effectiveness of Israel\\'s aerial defense system, the Iron Dome, which has protected civilians in Israel from Hamas\\' rockets. During the weeks of fighting, Hamas has fired thousands of rockets back at Israel, according to The New York Times. But is there support for the militant group among ordinary Palestinians, and what does the group really want?  Here\\'s a quick primer.  Palestinian supporters of Hamas and Hamas members march during a rally to protest Israeli raids and detentions on June 20 in Gaza.Image:  Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency/Gety ImagesWhat is Hamas? Hamas is a fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in the West Bank and Gaza. It was formed in 1987 at the start of the Palestinian uprising, known as the first intifada. Its military wing is known as the al-Qassam Brigades. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union. The group takes its name from the Arabic initials for the Islamic Resistance Movement. For most of its existence, it has pitched itself in opposition to Fatah, a Palestinian political party affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO. In 2006, Hamas surprised many observers by beating Fatah and winning a majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament. “I don’t think they actually ran with the expectation of winning a majority,\" said Abdullah Al-Arian, a history professor at Georgetown University\\'s School of Foreign Service in Qatar. “That put them in a really awkward position because that’s not really who they are.”  Holding up the Fatah colors (front) and Hamas colors (behind), student supporters of the parties rally during the al-Najah University student council elections, in the West Bank city of Nablus in 2006. Image:  JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat does Hamas want? For years, Hamas\\' stated goal was the destruction of Israel. But over time some Hamas members reportedly abandoned that idea as they tried to garner power through the democratic process.  The group, however, remains divided on whether a Palestinian state can coexist with Israel and the group is still committed to combating Israel through armed force.  Other goals, such as getting Israel to reopen Gaza\\'s borders and allowing the free flow of goods in and out of the territory, are more widely shared among Palestinians.  Because it is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S., it is unclear whether Hamas will be able to achieve any of its goals through negotiation. \"The real question is what they can deliver in terms of substantive, practical solutions to the problems,\" Arian said. Practical gains, he added, would put Hamas \"in as strong a position as possible. Then it won\\'t really be a question of who\\'s in government.\"   Abu Obeida, spokesman of al-Qassam Brigade, the military wing of the Hamas movement, speaks during a press conference in Gaza City on July 3.Where is Hamas located? Khaled Meshaal, the organization\\'s leader since 2004, used to run Hamas\\' Kuwaiti branch and now resides in Qatar.  Hamas is most prevalent in Gaza, though the group has some supporters in the Fatah-dominated West Bank.  Whether the current conflict with Israel is actually helping Hamas is a matter of debate. Some speculate that anger at Israel\\'s killing of civilians may help boost Hamas\\' popularity.  On Friday, during a so-called \\'Day of Rage,\\' thousands of Palestinians protested in the West Bank to show solidarity with fellow Palestinians in Gaza. It was the largest West Bank protest since 2005 and at least five Palestinians were killed during  violent clashes with Israeli security forces.  What is Hamas\\' role in the current conflict? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank in mid-June. Soon after, Israeli forces arrested several Hamas leaders. Hamas denied any involvement in the kidnapping and retaliated by firing rockets into Israel.  The militants have used a sophisticated system of tunnels to travel from Gaza into Israel and ambush Israeli soldiers. In response, the Israeli military has bombarded supposed Hamas strongholds, killing hundreds of civilians in the process.  Some Palestinians are angry with Hamas because they feel the group\\'s tactics draw fire to populated areas and that civilians get caught in the crossfire. But that doesn\\'t appear to be a majority opinion, according to a new poll by the organization Arab World for Research and Development. It shows that 64% of Palestinians believe their views align more with Hamas than Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has the full support of just 15% of the population.  Those numbers show how many Palestinians feel that Hamas is the only group willing to stand up to Israel, a country which they believe keeps Palestinians under a brutal military occupation.

       " ' Even though Israel’s U.S.-funded “Iron Dome” rocket-defense interceptors appear to be hitting Hamas rockets in recent days, they are almost certainly failing in the crucial job of detonating those rockets’ shrapnel-packed explosive warheads, expert analysts say. As a result, rockets fired from Gaza are probably plunging to the ground with intact explosives. The fact that they aren’t causing injuries or deaths in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities is mainly a matter of luck, the analysts add. On July 10, the Israel Defense Forces said missiles from the system had intercepted 56 rockets fired out of Gaza, preventing strikes in several cities. Yet Richard Lloyd, a weapons expert and consultant who is a past Engineering Fellow at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, says that because these interceptions had almost certainly not detonated the rockets’ warheads, “it’s pretty much a total failure.” The Iron Dome system — meant to hit rockets traveling tens of miles from launch to landing — is a smaller cousin to the Patriot system, which attempts to hit much longer-range, faster incoming missiles. Iron Dome fires interceptors six inches wide and 10 feet long and uses sensors and real-time guidance systems to try to zero in on the rockets. When an Iron Dome interceptor gets close to an incoming rocket, a proximity fuse triggers the interceptor to detonate, spraying out metal rods that are intended to strike and detonate the warheads on the incoming rockets, neutralizing their ability to maim people and destroy things on the ground. Ted Postol, the MIT physicist and missile-defense expert who aided Lloyd’s analysis and who in 1991 debunked claims by the U.S. Army that its Patriot missiles were successfully shooting down Iraqi Scud missiles during the first Gulf War (see “Postol vs. the Pentagon” and “Preventing Fratricide”), agrees that they were failing in this crucial warhead-detonation job. Postol had been an admirer of Iron Dome after initial reports of its performance during previous rocket assaults in 2012 (see “Why Israel’s Iron Dome Missile Defense System Actually Works”). But later analyses of interceptor contrails showed that its guidance system was behaving erratically. Instead of smoothly rising to meet their targets, the interceptors were making sharp turns and engaging from the side or behind, he says. Those problems appear to be continuing, he says. “We expected that after more than a year and a half of time, whatever problems there were in the system related to guidance and control would be mitigated, or somewhat mitigated,” he says. “As it turns out, this is not the case. As far as we can tell, it is behaving in the same erratic way as it did in November 2012.” The Iron Dome interceptors need to hit an incoming rocket head-on to have much hope of detonating a warhead, Lloyd says. And initial visual analysis of the engagements in recent days shows that the interceptions that are occurring are from the side or behind, which provide “essentially a zero chance of destroying the warhead,” based on the basic physics of such engagements, he added. Hamas rockets in late 2012 were going as far as 75 kilometers (47 miles), but some are now able to go twice as far.

       " ' Facebook announced on Thursday that the site\\'s two-step app permission process has been fully integrated with users worldwide. The feature, which was first announced in April, allows users to have more control over the content they share to Facebook through third-party applications.  When users sign in to an app like Lyft or Words With Friends using their Facebook login credentials, they can now specify exactly what they would like to share with Facebook in a two-step process. The first step asks for \"read permissions,\" which dictate the information from the app accessible to Facebook. The second step presents \"write permissions,\" which if accepted, allow the user to post directly back to his news feed through the app.  See also: How to Change Your Facebook Relationship Status Without Alerting Friends Previously, the two permissions were a package deal, meaning you couldn\\'t agree to one without also green-lighting the other. The update in April granted users more control and enabled them to accept just one or the other if they weren\\'t comfortable accepting both, according to Chris Daniels, director of business development at Facebook. The update is now fully available to all users, and a recent study of certain \"high quality\" apps by the social network found that 80% of users accepted the permissions  when prompted.  Facebook benefits from users logging in to third-party apps using their Facebook profile. Those who log in with Facebook count as \"active\" users for the platform — more logins mean more content shared back to the site. Facebook has more than 850 million login events per month, and 81 of the 100 top-grossing iOS apps support Facebook login features, according to the company\\'s blog post. On Android, 62 of the 100 top-grossing apps support Facebook logins.  The new permission option was based on feedback from users and developers who felt they needed more control, Daniels said. Often, users timid about sharing back to Facebook saw the permissions page and simply elected to bypass logging in altogether.  \"We understand people’s concerns about apps posting on their Timeline or to their friends,\" Facebook posted on its blog. \"The recent changes to Login are just the beginning of more improvements you\\'ll see as we continue working to provide useful services for developers that are easy for users to understand.\"\\xa0  Have you ever skipped logging into an app because of Facebook permissions?

Disney executives announced on Tuesday in Los Angeles a new gaming platform that does just that  — and even features real-life game pieces that make it come alive.  Disney Infinity, which is currently in development with Avalanche Software and will debut in June, will feature 17 plastic characters — and 40 interactive pieces — from both Disney and Pixar movies to power the game. The toys will focus on upcoming film Monsters University, as well as The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean. It will also come with a base, so when figures are placed on top, they can play certain experiences. Meanwhile, each film has its own Playset (or gaming universe) that can combine up to three characters from other films.    However, the company stressed its more of an interactive gaming platform than just a typical game. Disney Infinity will come to gaming consoles such as Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii U and Wii systems, and will also come to mobile and online platforms, as well.   Disney is facing some tough competition in the interactive toy market. Activision's Skylanders franchise, released in 2011, also combines collectable toys with a video game for a unique interactive experience.

       " \" Widening our view of the world can mean taking a much closer look at the familiar. And technology from MRI to Scanning Electron Microscopes, which use focused beams to interact with a sample's surface to produce nano-sized resolution, is allowing scientists and medical researchers to delve into our strange and beautiful world (sometimes aided with a little Photoshop). Three academics with winning entries in this year's Wellcome Image Awards tell us how they got their image. Kidney stone Kevin Mackenzie, Microscopy Manager, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen  Image:  Kevin Mackenzie,  University of AberdeenI'm always on the lookout for new and interesting specimens to image and when I had kidney stones a few years ago I managed to collect one. I decided to image in the light microscope, Micro CT and also under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The resulting image was taken using a Zeiss MA10 SEM and false colored using Adobe Photoshop. The size of the stone is 2mm across (which is quite small for a kidney stone). Kidney stones form when salts, minerals and chemicals in the urine (for example calcium oxalate and uric acid) clump together and solidify. Small kidney stones are often passed naturally, but larger stones sometimes get stuck in the kidney or in the tubes that carry urine out of the body. Louse egg on hair Kevin Mackenzie, Microscopy Manager, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen  Image:  Kevin Mackenzie,  University of AberdeenI was very happy to have another two images selected for the awards, one was a Scanning Electron Micrograph of a single head louse egg attached to a human hair, and the other was a Micro CT scan of a medieval (so over 1000 years old) jawbone. Brain nerve fibers Zeynep Saygin, Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT  Image:  Zeynep M. Saygin,  McGovern Institute,  MITMy image depicts the nerve fibers, or wiring, of the healthy human brain. Brain cells communicate with each other through these fibers and we can visualize them in every individual using a specialized MRI scan. The colors represent the direction of the fibers: blue for those that travel up and down; green for front to back; and red for left to right. I am continually astounded by the number and complexity of these nerve fibers; what information do these connections carry and how do they orchestrate complex mental processes? My research combines these images of connectivity with neural response patterns in order to understand the complex circuitry of the brain, and how it ultimately shapes who we are. Human heart tissue Sergio Bertazzo, Junior Research Fellow, Imperial College London  Image:  Sergio Bertazzo,  Imperial College LondonThis is a density-dependent color scanning electron micrograph of the surface of human heart (aortic valve) tissue. The spherical particles show calcification. The orange color identifies denser material (calcified material composed of calcium phosphate), while structures that appear in green are less dense (corresponding to the organic component of the tissue). The discovery of calcified particles shows that calcification in the cardiovascular system is more complex than being just a regular process of bone formation.

To capture this image, the zebrafish was physically attached to a stub (specimen holder) by its tail and tilted to 65 degrees. As zebrafish embryos are approximately 1cm in length, making the whole embryo too big to be captured in a single image, three separate images had to be taken along its length and then stitched together digitally. Color was then added to the black-and-white image. Brown long-eared bat Chris Thorn, Medical Artist  Image:  Chris ThornX-ray projection of a brown long-eared bat hunted and killed by a domestic cat.

       " \"     Season two of Netflix's Emmy-nominated supernatural thriller Hemlock Grove, about a former Pennsylvania steel town and its modern-day mysterious murders, will debut July 11. Netflix members will be able to watch all 10 one-hour episodes starting on that Friday, a binge-friendly release strategy Netflix has implemented with its other original shows such as political thriller House of Cards and prison comedy-drama Orange Is the New Black. See also: 'Mean Girls' and 'Titanic' Are Finally on Netflix The bloody season one of Hemlock Grove — starring Famke Janssen , Bill Skarsgard, Landon Liboiron and Dougray Scott — earned two Emmy nominations in 2013 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects and Outstanding Main Title Theme Music. Netflix describes season two as such: Season two continues with the town coming to grips with the shocking massacre incurred by one of its deadliest creatures. Roman and Peter are now faced with new responsibilities and the realities that come with adulthood. Roman’s relationship with his mother is all but dead as he struggles with his unwanted Upir birthright and the disappearance of his sister, Shelley. Peter moves in with Destiny) and is forced to get a job after his mother is sent away. Meanwhile, in search of a new life, newcomer Miranda Cates, embarks on Hemlock Grove with an unknowingly profound effect on Peter and Roman. And Norman, still reeling from the loss of his family, must face the harsh truths that are uncovered about those he still loves.  BONUS: 9 Netflix Original Series to Stream in 2014   Netflix Original Series 2014        1. House of Cards (Season 2)  The leader of the pack when it comes to Netflix-created series, this political drama starring Kevin Spacey wasn't only a smash hit, but Season 1 was nominated for nine Emmy awards. Part West Wing without the Sorkinese, Scandal with more schmooze, and a whole lot of Kevin Spacey being awesome, this is drama is frankly better and juicier than pretty much anything on ABC, CBS, or NBC. If you haven’t watched Season 1, you have about a month to catch up, as Season 2 will debut on Valentine’s Day.            2. Orange Is the New Black (Season 2)  Piper, Alex and the gang are coming back in 2014! Season 2 promises to be filled with even more of the drama of Season 1, with more of a focus on the group as a whole and less on one individual (ahem, Piper). Not that it wasn’t interesting and moving to see how Piper went from the scared, preppy blond to the angry she-Hulk that beat Pennsatucky to a pulp in the Season 1 finale. Still, now that Piper has truly shed all pretense that she is better or different than the women she’s incarcerated with, it makes sense to focus on group dynamics. Plus, who wouldn’t want more screen time for Red, Taystee and Crazy Eyes?   Image: Netflix         3. Turbo F.A.S.T. (Fast Action Stunt Team)  A few episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T. premiered on Dec. 24, 2013, but the bulk of the series is streaming in 2014. Yes, Turbo is mostly fare for the small fry, but as one of the first collaborations between Netflix and DreamWorks Animation, it promises to be a fun ride. Plus, with episodes clocking in at approximately 11 minutes, it’s an easy way to relax and have a laugh on your morning commute. Just don’t be surprised if you suddenly notice a five-year-old watching over your shoulder on the train.   Image: Netflix         4. Sense8   This highly anticipated series comes from none other than the Wachowskis (The Matrix) and Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski. A contemporary sci-fi thriller series aimed for adults, the show seems to be a cross between Misfits and Babel, in which eight people worldwide gain the ability to communicate with each other via telepathy. With both the Wachowskis and Straczynski set to write and direct episodes, the show looks to be a sci-fi lover’s dream. All 10 episodes will be available to stream at the same time when the series debuts in late 2014.   Image: Jemal Countess/Getty Images         5. Hemlock Grove (Season 2)  Developed by Eli Roth, Season 1 of Hemlock Grove featured all the gore, suspense and monsters that any horror fan could ever want. In that respect, expect Season 2 to top Season 1. As Roth himself promised in a statement: “The worldwide fan response to Hemlock Grove was phenomenal. Netflix members loved the potent combination of sexy monsters, mystery and the dark family soap opera that ended with a huge twist, leaving audiences worldwide totally shocked. Season 1 was just a warmup for what we have in store for Season 2. Get ready to be scared in ways you never expected.”   So, if you didn’t think Hostel was scary enough, then tune in for Hemlock’s Season 2, because you will get more than your fill of thrill with a 10-episode overload of blood, screams and creepy crawlies (oh yeah, and more blood).    Image: Wikimedia Commons, Netflix         6. Narcos   A collaboration between Gaumont International Television and Netflix, the drama Narcos is set to revolve around the life and death of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Although details about the series are scarce, and not much has been officially confirmed, execs have reportedly tapped Jose Padilha (RoboCop) -- pictured above -- to direct episodes as well as, more or less, run the series. Although it’s difficult to tell the true direction of the series, given the lack of information, it will be interesting to see if Netflix can score itself a critically acclaimed hit around the underbelly of the criminal drug world like The Wire.   Image: Axel Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images         7. Marco Polo   You guessed it -- this drama is about explorer Marco Polo, with Hollywood powerbrokers Harvey and Bob Weinstein as producers. Starz had originally picked up Marco Polo in 2012; reports show that Netflix may run with it this year. The show chronicles a young Polo as he adventures into China, filled with political intrigue, adventure and encounters with Kublai Khan. Though it hasn’t yet been determined whether Marco Polo will be a series or a feature film (or whether the Weinsteins will choose to let it remain with Netflix), with Josh Fusco (Young Guns) and Dave Erikson (Sons of Anarchy) listed as creators, it should certainly be on your radar.   Image: Flickr, Pilar Rubio Remiro         8. BoJack Horseman   This adult-oriented animated series features the voices of Will Arnett (Arrested Development) and Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) about a whiskey-loving former TV star, who just so happens to be a horse (Arnett) with a human sidekick (Paul), and an ex-lover -- a cat named Princess Caroline (Amy Sedaris). Seriously, why wouldn’t you tune in?    Image: Netflix         9. Untitled Psychological Thriller  Yes, yes, it’s vague and doesn’t even have a title yet, but there’s a reason said untitled psychological thriller is getting a lot of buzz. Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, the minds behind the hit series Damages, are the ones bringing it to Netflix. This time, the characters play mind games in a family setting, with all sorts of secrets and skeletons popping out of the closet when a black sheep brother comes home. Sounds like a twisted Parenthood.    Image: Evan Agostini/Staff         BONUS: Daredevil  It's true that the first brainchild of Netflix's collaboration with Marvel is set for 2015, but hey, one can hope/pray/start an online petition for the date getting pushed up to...say, late 2014? Maybe a Christmas Eve premiere (like Turbo F.A.S.T.) is possible, at which millions of Netflix subscribers worldwide would know exactly what to do with their vacations between Christmas and New Year's Day: Marathon all 13 episodes, live tweet and then marathon again.

       " ' U.S. retailers, already the heaviest spenders in digital advertising by category, are forecast to increase their spending by another 14% to $9.4 billion this year. By next year, that figure will surpass $10.4 billion, reaching $13.3 billion by 2017. According to estimates from eMarketer, retailers already account for 22.3% of all digital ad spending, the most of any industry. About two-thirds of their investments are in direct response ads (i.e., those designed to lead to a sale, rather than promote a brand). Direct response formats include  search, mobile messaging and classifieds.     Other industries, including financial services, consumer packaged goods and travel, are also forecast to increase their investments in digital advertising over the next five years. Like retailers, firms in the financial services and travel industries are investing the majority of their digital ad dollars in direct-response formats. Consumer packaged good companies, however, are dedicating over half of their digital ad dollars to branding opportunities, such as banner ads and rich media. Not all industries are increasing their digital ad spend as quickly, however: The healthcare and pharmaceutical industry are only expected to increase their spending by 6.4% this year, less than half the U.S. average of 14%. Consumer electronics and telecom companies are also investing at a slower pace, at 12.5% and 11.1% growth, respectively. Images courtesy of iStockphoto, Henrik5000 and eMarketer ',\n",
       " ' If you want a project to be successful, user experience and interaction are key. An effective web design process needs to include testing, feedback and refinement. Receiving feedback can act as quality assurance, give you an alternative perspective, help you develop new ideas and ensure you\\'re meeting your users\\' requirements and expectations. See also: How to Solicit the Customer Feedback Your Startup Needs There are various types of feedback, from \"voice of the customer\" and surveys to process level and crowdsourcing. In this article, we concentrated on UI/UX testing and usability. We\\'ve put together a selection of software and online-based tools that you can use to help your website reach its maximum potential.  Are there any similar tools that you would recommend? If so, please share the link with our readers in the comments below. 1. Silverback  Image: Silverback Silverback is guerrilla usability testing software created by design consultancy Clearleft. It is built especially for designers and developers, and it allows you to capture screen activity, video the testers face and record their voice. You can set tasks and mark noteworthy events within a session, add chapter markers on the fly, control recording with the remote and export easily to Quicktime. Silverback is perfect for those on a small budget, as it requires no setup, using your Mac\\'s hardware. It can provide true insights into user behavior, which will allow you to make informed decisions on design and development. Silverback runs on Mac OS X Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion with a built-in iSight or some alternative. However, it does not run on 10.4 or lower.  2. Concept Feedback  Image: Concept Feedback Concept Feedback aims to provide expert analysis and detailed recommendations from experts qualified in their respective fields, including designers, developers, marketers and entrepreneurs. It\\'s free to join, and it asks you to review five other concepts before you can post your own.  The knowledgeable community will then give you feedback on your projects and valuable tips on how to improve it. You can use multiple experts (up to five in each feedback category) to bring different perspectives to your project, and help uncover additional issues and ideas. Feedback is delivered within two business days, but can be as quick as a few hours. You will receive both written and visual feedback based on principles and real-world experience.  3. Usabilla  Image: Usabilla Usabilla is designed to increase conversion with visual feedback on your website, either through live website feedback or surveys used at any stage of the design process. Both options allow for instant improvements in user experience and conversions, based on specific feedback with visual context. Usabilla Live can be used by adding a small snippet of code to your website so you can utilize the feedback button and technology. The button can be fully customized, and people can select and rate any item on your web page in a simple and efficient manner.  Usabilla Survey lets you focus on your users from the very beginning, built as an online tool for automated remote user testing and visual surveys. You can integrate these tests in your daily workflow and improve your design with high quality feedback.  4. Five Second Test  Image: Five Second Test Five Second Test lets you fine-tune your website by analyzing the most prominent elements of your design. First impressions are important, and by finding out what a person recalls about your design in just five seconds, you can ensure that your message is communicated effectively. To get started, upload a screenshot or mockup, set some questions to be answered and wait for feedback. Testers have five seconds to view your image and must answer the questions you have set. All the responses are collected for you, with frequent keywords extracted, and the data presented in graphs.  Five Second Test isn\\'t just concerned with first impressions, though — you can also test your brand message, to see if users recall your company slogan or understand what you do simply from your logo.  5. Verify  Image: Verify Verify lets you collect and analyze user feedback on screens or mockups in real time, so you can see where people click, what people remember about your design or how they feel about it. Using several tests, you can collect specific, actionable data and then view and sort through the results by demographics. Intuitive, helpful summaries are also available for download, with insights on your users\\' expectations and reactions to your design.  You can share tests quickly with public or private URLs, and use Verify to help your team make decisions based on accurate data that will improve user interaction on your site. A design survey is simple and fast to set up. There are eight ways to survey your designs, including preference test, click test, memory test and more.  6. Feedback Army  Image: Feedback Army Feedback Army focuses on testing the usability of your website and can be completed in just two minutes. Once you submit specific questions that you would like answered about your website, you receive 10 responses (with an option to increase this up to 50). Each feedback request is posted for eight days. However, you\\'ll typically start to see results within one to three hours. Each review generates a unique URL that is used to view your results. However, your questions and link are publicly available on Feedback Army for as long as it takes for the reviewers to review the site. After your site receives the specific number of reviews, your link and questions are pulled.  You have quality control over responses, with the ability to reject responses and request a new one. Note that this feature is only available for 48 hours, after which the response is auto-approved. The reviewers are from a pool of Mechanical Turk workers, while the majority of the Feedback Army fee pays the reviewers for a quality review.  7. User Testing  Image: User Testing User Testing allows you to choose users who match your target demographics and observe them, watching their screen activity and listening to their voices as they share their experiences of using your website. You can start with a template or create your own test describing the tasks you want the users to perform. Representative users from a selected panel will immediately record themselves using your site. Within one hour, you receive a usability test video and written answers to the questions you set. There is also an option to ask users follow-up questions.  User Testing can provide a unique opportunity to \"look over the shoulder\" of your target audience members while they use your website, so you can see and hear where users get stuck and why they leave. It\\'s not just for completed website testing either — you can test during the design or prototyping phase, enabling you to make informed design decisions throughout a project.  8. Try My UI  Image: Try My UI Try My UI allows you to watch videos of real people using your website to find out specific ways it could be improved. You can also hear users\\' opinions of what they like and dislike as they use the site. It utilizes OpenHallway\\'s API to provide a simple, one-stop usability testing service. To get started create your first test, and present a general scenario with a set of tasks for the test users to follow. You will then receive a narrated video within the hour of each user navigating your website. You can see their screen, mouse movements and keystrokes, as well as hear what they see, read, think or do. You also receive written answers to the four questions you provide at the beginning of the test.  Candidate testers are selected based on a variety of factors, meaning you receive moderated quality feedback. You can currently limit the tester pool by gender, age, annual income, country, education level, family status, social network usage and employment type. You can even add your own qualification criteria.  9. Criticue  Image: Criticue Criticue allows you to have your website or design concept peer-reviewed by an intelligent community of entrepreneurs, usability experts and web designers. It\\'s a newly launched platform that offers a free and confidential service. Criticue is based on a fair one-for-one exchange; for every site you review, you receive a review of your own website. The reviews are quick and focused on design and first-time impressions.  To submit your website, type your website URL and Criticue will automatically take a snapshot of the page, or you can upload your own. Then review another user\\'s design to provide useful feedback and tips on usability and optimization. Then you\\'ll receive feedback on your own design from your peers. You can use the suggestions and ideas to improve your website, boost traffic and refine design concepts backed up by objective, qualified opinions.  10. Userlytics  Image: Userlytics Userlytics provides in-depth customer insight using interviews in addition to usability and experience testing. It allows you to observe real people engaging with your concept, prototype or website in real time. You can find out what your users think, and how they react, as you watch and listen to participants conduct tasks, answer questions and interact with your assets. Userlytics allows you to test prototypes throughout the design process, including concept sketches and wireframes, and you can create a baseline to better understand how a new design will compare with your current website. Testing throughout this phase can provide validation of your proof of concept and help iron out flaws within the UI.  You can set up a test quickly, and define your tasks and questions. Userlytics then provides the participants or you can recruit your own. You receive the results of the test within hours in the cloud. Share with project members or clients, and download and edit the video or survey responses.  Additional Tools The tools and apps above are among the the best to gather feedback, test design concepts and measure website usability. However, there\\'s a wealth of other available tools that may interest you:  Feedbackify Webreep Kampyle Qualaroo iPerceptions Clicktale Mouseflow GhostRec Optimizely Visual Website Optimizer  With these resources, you\\'ll have a much more successful, user-friendly project on your hands.

       " ' Since Facebook acquired Instagram last year, there has been much speculation about its plans for the popular photo-sharing app. Now, new reports indicate that Instagram is working on a messaging feature. Citing an anonymous source, GigaOm reported last month that Instagram was preparing to launch a new private-messaging feature. It claimed the new feature would pop up in an updated version of Instagram before the end of this year. See also: 10 Must-Follow Instagram Accounts for Stylish Women A holiday launch, one of the busiest times on social media in terms of photo-sharing, would make perfect sense for a new Instagram messaging product. On Friday, Techcrunch revealed information obtained from an anonymous source that shows several users have been given personal Instagram.com email addresses. The source, reportedly an ecommerce marketing professional, discovered the unique email addresses during a data-gathering request from a third-party company that collects social-networking information. Currently, there are no further details about what the personal email addresses might mean, or how they would work for Instagram users. But given Facebook’s recent moves toward offering Facebook.com email addresses as part of its service, such a change would fall right in line with the company’s strategy to tighten its grip on existing users by offering features that keep them linked to Facebook wherever they go. Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Image: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images ',\n",
       " ' Not long after Microsoft defended how it accessed a blogger\\'s private Hotmail account to determine if a former employee stole trade secrets, there was an outcry over the privacy implications.  Now, Microsoft is making a change to its privacy policy that would require its legal team — not its internal investigations department — to look into cases to see if a court order is required to access private user data. The company would submit the evidence to an outside lawyer and perform the search only if a judge signs off on it. Microsoft will also publish a bi-annual transparency report that will highlight these types of searches. Earlier this week, reports circulated that former Microsoft staffer Alex Kibkalo is facing federal criminal chargers over allegations that he stole trade secrets during his tenure at the company. The indictment states Kibkalo \"uploaded proprietary software and pre-release software updates for Windows 8 RT as well as the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit (SDK)\" to his personal SkyDrive (now OneDrive) account in August 2012.  SEE ALSO: Edward Snowden: The Biggest Revelations Are Yet to Come  In 2012, a French blogger tipped off Microsoft that he received a code from the Microsoft Server SDK, which had originally come from a Hotmail user and meant Microsoft could access his account without a court order. This was legal because a statement in Microsoft\\'s terms of service allowed the action to take place if it was to protect the security of its customers. Eventually, the move led to an investigation where, according to court documents, Kibkalo was identified as the source and admitted leaking Microsoft code to outsiders.  In a statement to Mashable, Microsoft defended its action when it came to accessing the blogger\\'s data, saying it was done to \"protect our customers and the security and integrity of our products.\"  Microsoft VP and Deputy General Counsel John Frank also shed more light on the updates related to its privacy policies:  We believe that Outlook and Hotmail email are and should be private.  Today there has been coverage about a particular case.  While we took extraordinary actions in this case based on the specific circumstances and our concerns about product integrity that would impact our customers, we want to provide additional context regarding how we approach these issues generally and how we are evolving our policies. Courts do not issue orders authorizing someone to search themselves, since obviously no such order is needed.  So even when we believe we have probable cause, it’s not feasible to ask a court to order us to search ourselves. However, even we should not conduct a search of our own email and other customer services unless the circumstances would justify a court order, if one were available.  In order to build on our current practices and provide assurances for the future, we will follow the following policies going forward: To ensure we comply with the standards applicable to obtaining a court order, we will rely in the first instance on a legal team separate from the internal investigating team to assess the evidence. We will move forward only if that team concludes there is evidence of a crime that would be sufficient to justify a court order, if one were applicable. As an additional step, as we go forward, we will then submit this evidence to an outside attorney who is a former federal judge.  We will conduct such a search only if this former judge similarly concludes that there is evidence sufficient for a court order.Even when such a search takes place, it is important that it be confined to the matter under investigation and not search for other information.  We therefore will continue to ensure that the search itself is conducted in a proper manner, with supervision by counsel for this purpose. Finally, we believe it is appropriate to ensure transparency of these types of searches, just as it is for searches that are conducted in response to governmental or court orders.  We therefore will publish as part of our bi-annual transparency report the data on the number of these searches that have been conducted and the number of customer accounts that have been affected. The only exception to these steps will be for internal investigations of Microsoft employees who we find in the course of a company investigation are using their personal accounts for Microsoft business. And in these cases, the review will be confined to the subject matter of the investigation. The privacy of our customers is incredibly important to us, and while we believe our actions in this particular case were appropriate given the specific circumstances, we want to be clear about how we will handle similar situations going forward. That is why we are building on our current practices and adding to them to further strengthen our processes and increase transparency. John Frank, Vice President & Deputy General Counsel  Christina Warren contributed to this report ',\n",
       " ' LeBron James will earn $20.6 million this NBA season. Kevin Durant will earn $19 million. Kobe Bryant will lead the league with a $23.5 million salary.  Yet all three of them, who are among the NBA\\'s biggest stars, aren\\'t making as much as they should relative to the value they bring the league and their respective teams. Welcome to the parallel universe of being a professional basketball megastar, where you can earn $20 million per year, say you\\'re underpaid — and actually have a point.  See also: A YouTube Legend Battles for His Basketball Future It\\'s not a new gripe. Bryant raised the issue a few months ago. But a new number shows Bryant\\'s line of thinking may be something to consider: $24 billion — the value of NBA\\'s new nine-year broadcast deal with ESPN and Turner.  The deal starts in in 2016, and the NBA will earn about $2.6 billion per year. For reference, the league\\'s current deal with those same broadcast partners was agreed to in 2007 and pays the NBA about $930 million per season. Translation: The NBA and its billionaire owners are about to see a lot more cash coming their way.  Those same owners mollywhopped the players\\' union in 2011, when an extended work stoppage resulted in the players taking a 6% cut in their revenue split with owners, down to 51% from 57%. Now, say many players, the stars who make the league go won\\'t allow franchise owners to cry poverty — without providing any real proof of such — again when it\\'s time for a new round of collective bargaining in 2017.  “The whole thing that went on with the negotiation process was that the owners were telling us that they were losing money,” James told The New York Times the day after the new TV deal was announced. “There is no way they can sit in front of us and tell us that right now.” Kevin Durant echoed James\\' sentiments. “That’s a lot of money,” he told The Oklahoman on Tuesday. “That’s a lot of money. I don’t see how owners can say they losing money now.” Even if a given team loses some money in a particular year — and most make money — the appreciating value of NBA teams as a whole means the owner of that money-losing team is still likely sitting on a cash cow. Herb Kohl bought the Milwaukee Bucks for $18 million in 1989 and sold them this April for $550 million. Donald Sterling bought the Los Angeles Clippers for a little more than $12 million in 1981 (when they played in San Diego) and sold them for $2 billion this year.  A star-driven league More than any other professional sports league in America, the NBA is driven by its stars. Players aren\\'t hidden beneath hats or inside helmets. They\\'re allowed a creative freedom — which their athleticism amplifies to jaw-dropping effect — with the ball you don\\'t find in other sports. One player can have a bigger impact on a game\\'s result than in football, soccer, baseball or hockey. Its biggest stars are icons the world over.  Of course, many players are drastically overpaid, compensated at a value far greater than what they bring to their squad\\'s on-court results or their team owners\\' bottom lines (we\\'re looking at you Amar\\'e Stoudemire and Joe Johnson). This distorts the conversation. So does the sheer magnitude of the numbers we\\'re talking about; after all, $20 million is a lot! But the plight of the select few — players whose ability and popularity approaches that of Bryant, Durant and James — is real. Relatively speaking, of course.   The NBA will soon get a cash infusion and superstar players like Kevin Durant don\\'t plan to be left out. Image: Sue Ogrocki/Associated PressIf you want to point to one culprit, look no further than the NBA\\'s tough salary cap, which penalizes teams for paying its roster above a certain collective threshold ($63 million this season). Ostensibly a measure to ensure competitive balance, owners typically are in favor of this because it keeps their payroll costs down. Players are typically against it, because it limits what they can earn and allots only a portion of the total cap to one superstar player. The salary cap is another negotiating point the league and its franchise owners won resoundingly over players during the collective bargaining negotiations of 2011.  \"The owners started with what they usually ask for, a hard salary cap,\" writes NBA.com\\'s David Aldridge. \"They didn\\'t get that, but they got the next-best thing: incredibly punitive financial penalties on teams that continued to exceed the salary cap.\" The upshot is superstar players are faced with a strange choice when it\\'s time to renegotiate their contracts. On the one hand, they can take the maximum permitted under salary cap rules, but thereby hamper their team\\'s ability to surround them with other quality talent and be given the damning label of a player who values money over winning. On the other hand, they can settle for less than they\\'re worth under league rules — never mind if the NBA labor landscape was a free market.  Bryant spoke to this dichotomy via Twitter on Tuesday.   Players are \"encouraged\" per new CBA to take less to win or risk being called selfish+ungrateful while nbatv deal goes UP by a BILLION #biz — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) October 7, 2014  Millionaires vs. billionaires When talking about players who already make millions upon millions of dollars per year, it\\'s hard to summon much sympathy for money left on the table. But when your NBA earning potential is very finite, you could suffer devastating injury at any time and, often, you come from a poor background and are looking to set your family up for generations to come, every million counts. Add to that the fact that these millionaire players are negotiating contracts against billionaire owners and the calculus changes just a bit.  Not even counting the income injection the NBA will get when its new TV deal kicks in, what\\'s a player like LeBron actually worth right now? That\\'s a nearly impossible number to pinpoint, but most agree he\\'s worth more than the $20 million he\\'s due this year. A Forbes estimate from July pegs the real number at about $28 million; a Deadspin analysis from June put his actual value last year at $44 million.   What would a superstar like Kobe Bryant be worth in a free market? It\\'s impossible to pinpoint, but fascinating to consider. Image: Lenny Ignelzi/Associated PressNow, one could argue that without the NBA there is no LeBron James; but a more convincing argument is that without players like James, there is no NBA. Other leagues such as the NFL would stand a much better chance of surviving if, say, their top 20 stars walked away to start a new venture. A league of player-owners sharing in all of their glorious revenues and eliminating the middle-man franchise owners? It\\'s fascinating idea to consider, but extremely unlikely to happen.  What\\'s more likely is the player\\'s union pushes for no max contracts in 2017, or no salary cap at all. Owners fight back with their own stern demands; abolishing the guaranteed contract, perhaps. Then collective bargaining negotiations stall, there\\'s a work stoppage, ultimately an agreement is reached and that agreement is a better deal for players overall yet still leaves the very best of them feeling slightly shortchanged.  Still, even in that scenario, James emerges a winner of sorts. When he was a free agent this past summer, the NBA\\'s very best player signed only a two-year deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers when he could have opted for the security of a longer contract with more guaranteed money. So what was he thinking? Well, that two-year deal expires in 2017 — just in time for his next contract to cash in on the NBA\\'s new TV-money infusion and its expected amplifying effect on player salaries.  As The Wire\\'s Stringer Bell once said, there are games beyond the game. James is playing them admirably — even if, in theory, he could still be pulling down several million more dollars per year.    2014\\'s Most Unforgettable Sports Moments        1. Richard Sherman goes off After Richard Sherman\\'s Seattle Seahawks beat the 49ers in January to reach Super Bowl XLVII, he went on an epic, trash-talking rant in a post-game interview. That led to a two-week news cycle of all Sherman, all the time, but he had a message for the haters.   Image: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press         2. Super Bowl? Super blowout Super Bowl XLVII was supposed to be a classic matchup between the up-and-coming Seahawks and Peyton Manning\\'s Denver Broncos.

NBA owner\\'s racist bombshell The world reacted in shock in April when audio was leaked of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling making a string of racist comments -- even though some of us weren\\'t so surprised. Powerful player statements came next. Then months of legal wrangling, but the NBA finally got rid of Sterling, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer now owns the team.   Image: Mark J.

Germany breaks Brazil\\'s collective heart Germany absolutely obliterated host Brazil in the World Cup semifinals on July 8, shocking soccer fans across the globe with a 7-1 win.

Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: It\\'s going to be fun to watch.   Image: Tony Dejak/Associated Press         9. Tony Stewart kills Kevin Ward, Jr. on the racetrack  NASCAR superstar Tony Stewart struck and killed a young driver named Kevin Ward, Jr. in a sprint-car race in August after Ward exited his vehicle to confront Stewart following a testy exchange on the track. This prompted speculation about whether Steward intended to hit Ward, and caused the star to miss some races. He was ultimately cleared, but it remains a truly shocking story.

The NFL implodes The NFL faced perhaps its worst moment in September when a string of domestic violence cases shed an unflattering light on the way the league disciplines and handles such crimes.

       " '     Gamers have always fantasized about more engaging play experiences — being \"inside\" the game. Every early attempt at virtual reality, or immersive gameplay, has come of as cheap or hokey.  But since the multi-million dollar Kickstarter for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, those dreams of exploring immersive game worlds are closer to reality. Currently, the Oculus Rift is in the hands of a few hundred developers and enthusiasts, and they are currently working on crafting experiences to fit the hardware. Journalists and some conference attendees have been the only ones besides developers to get their eyeballs inside the slightly awkward Rift headset, and we were able to check it out last week in New York. A few games have been already optimized for the Oculus Rift, including indie mech driving sim Hawken.  Oculus VR\\'s Vice President of Product Nate Mitchell set us up on the Rift. The headset fits over your head like ski goggles, obscuring the world around you except for what\\'s in front of your eyes. The headset can be wiggled and adjusted to find the perfect focal point for your eyes. Those without perfect vision can rejoice, because the Oculus Rift is designed to work with all types of eyes. The dev unit comes with three sets of lenses, two that adjust for nearsighted users. You can also just wear your glasses below the Rift visor. Mitchell said the consumer version would come with software to adjust for any visual type through menus. \"Everyone will be able to see 20/20 in virtual reality,\" Mitchell says.  SEE ALSO: Watch a 90-Year-Old Grandma Love the Oculus Rift Once set up, you can easily move your head around, and your vision parrots your actions inside the environment. Strapping on the Rift felt like stepping inside the mech\\'s cockpit to take it for a drive. I was instantly absorbed in the small details of the game: looking up at the sky showed me the smudges of dirt on my roof window, and looking down I could see the dashboard with my health and ammo count. Because each eye is seeing a slightly different image, the headset mimics stereoscopic 3D.  The developer version of Oculus Rift only broadcasts in 720p, with a screen resolution that is 1280x720, though you\\'ll half that to 640x720 because each eye takes up half the screen. That does mean the resolution will be a little low when playing, and some people will feel like they\\'re peering through a screen door. These are all things Mitchell says they hope to improve by the time the consumer version is released.  Mitchell said that developers are trying to optimize existing games to work with the Oculus Rift, and of course create new ones. Mitchell outlined many of the restrictions to making an effective virtual reality game, and says it can\\'t be approached in the same ways as normal game development. For one, things like text and menus don\\'t translate to virtual reality well. Hawken\\'s stripped down HUD was only present on the cockpit dashboard, not as a menu in front of your eyes. Mitchell also noted that players tend to explore VR worlds much more thoroughly, and will likely demand hi-res texture and detail in every nook and cranny to preserve immersion.  Developers are already hard at work on projects for the Rift. EVE Online\\'s developers showed off a prototype dogfighting space shooter using the VR headset last week. Mitchell also said each dev kit comes with several tools to make VR game development easier, including a four-month free trial of Unity\\'s engine. According to Mitchell, OculusVR still has a few iterations before the units are ready for consumers, including making them smaller and lighter. He wasn\\'t ready to give an official price, but he says the company\\'s goal was to make them as affordable as possible to encourage adoption. For reference, Kickstarter backers were able to purchase the dev kits for $300. While it isn\\'t really possible to share the virtual reality experience with someone who isn\\'t wearing the Oculus Rift, Mitchell projected what we were seeing while wearing the headset on a separate monitor. (It looks like double vision because it represents each eye.) Check out the video above of our experiences wearing the Oculus Rift, and let us know what you think in the comments. ',\n",
       " ' Christian Poincheval is a 65-year-old French inventor who has dedicated the past eight years of his life to making farts smell better. He claims that his Lutin Malin — which translates to \"crafty imp\" — line of pills ease digestion and \"perfume\" farts into smelling like roses or violets. Poincheval claims that his newest creation, just in time for the holidays, makes farts smell like chocolate. See also: 17 DIY Bathroom Hacks to Make Your Experience Less Crappy According to Poincheval\\'s website, the idea for the pills apparently came from a dinner with friends during which nobody could stop farting.

I had to do something.\" That horrific dinner, in which a group of several adults seemingly farted uncontrollably in a public space, inspired Poincheval to fix flatulence forever. He claims the pills are made from organic ingredients like blueberries, fennel and seaweed and that he sells \"several hundred a month.\" Poincheval told The Telegraph that he has many customers, especially around the holidays. \"Christmas always see a surge in sales,\" he said. A bottle of 60 pills retails for €9.99, or $12.50, which seems shockingly low for something that makes terrible things smell like good things. ',\n",
       " ' San Francisco\\'s Google Bus protesters are bringing their message from the streets to the courtroom.  A group of activists filed a lawsuit Thursday against the City of San Francisco in an attempt to halt a tech shuttle pilot program that will allow Silicon Valley tech giants like Apple and Google to use public bus stops to pick up and drop off employees for a small fee.  See also: 10 Must-Follow Breaking News Accounts on Twitter The tech companies already utilize city bus stops as a way to transport employees around San Francisco and to company headquarters in the Valley, sometimes as far as 50 miles away. The 18-month pilot program was first approved by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority\\'s Board of Directors in January as a response to public outrage over the tech shuttles. The pilot program was later upheld by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors last month.  The program is slated to start in July, and will charge buses $1 per stop, per day to use public bus stops, a fee that has been scoffed at by activists for being too low. Public transportation in San Francisco costs $2 per rider, per trip.  Plaintiffs in the case, including the Coalition For Fair, Legal and Environmental Transit and Service Employees International Union Local Union 1021, claim that what the city is doing with the pilot program violates state laws. According to California Vehicle Code 22500, it is illegal for private vehicles to use public bus stops, a law that has been ignored by police and elected officials, according to the lawsuit.  According to state law, any new transportation project also requires an Environmental Impact Report in order to determine how transportation changes may impact the local community. The lawsuit comes exactly one month after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 8-2 in favor of moving forward with the pilot program without first completing an EIR.  The lawsuit is yet another step in what has become a long, difficult process for both the city and activists — And the issues go much deeper than the enforcement of a state vehicle code.  Someone vandalized a tech shuttle on Friday with black marker in San Francisco\\'s Lower Haight neighborhood. The tech shuttles in San Francisco are seen by opponents as a symbol of the gentrification taking place in the city. According to protesters, rents have risen dramatically in neighborhoods near these shuttle stops, forcing lower and middle income families out of their homes. The shuttles also cause delays in public transportation, according to the lawsuit, and pose a threat to pedestrian and bike safety.  Supporters of the tech shuttles argue that they keep thousands of cars off the road by providing transportation to employees who would otherwise have to drive.  Protestors have taken to the streets in recent months to voice their displeasure over the city\\'s willingness to allow tech shuttles to operate at very little cost. A few of the most recent protests have garnered attention for their aggressive approach toward tech employees and shuttle riders. One protestor in Oakland (where tech shuttles also operate), vomited on a bus windshield. Another group of protestors gathered outside the home of Google Ventures Partner Kevin Rose, handling out flyers to his neighbors that identified him as a \"parasite.\"  Richard Drury is serving as legal council for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, and also represented tech shuttle opponents last month in the appeal the San Francisco Board of Supervisors that was rejected. Drury did not immediately respond to Mashable\\'s request for comment.  A handful of tech companies were named in the lawsuit as defendants. Both Apple and Google were named, but neither company immediately responded to Mashable\\'s request for comment. Other well-known shuttle providers like Facebook and Cisco were not named.  ',\n",

Pilots won't be able to take too many long trips though — the Bebop's battery life maxes out after 12 minutes of flight time.   The Parrot Bebop has a flight time of 12 minutes and uses a fisheye camera.Image:  Mashable,  Karissa BellParrot focused much of its efforts on video quality and stability. The drone uses built-in GPS so the drone will hover in place when the pilot takes their hands off the controllers. The Bebop is equipped with an array of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer, to ensure the stability of the video. The Skycontroller can also be connected to a TV, monitor or other display to view the drone's video. More adventurous pilots can use the Skycontroller in conjunction with an Oculus Rift headset. The Oculus plugs into the controller via an HDMI connection and pilots can use the headset to control the position of the Bebop's camera.  The camera on Parrot's new drone can be controlled with an Oculus Rift headset.Image:  Mashable,  Karissa BellWe got a chance to take the Bebop for a spin with the Oculus and the experience was pretty incredible. Flying the drone with the Oculus headset provided a unique first-person view of the piloting experience. The effort Parrot put into image stabilization really comes through, though there was some lag in the unit we tried out. Both the drone and Skycontroller will be available sometime in the fourth quarter of 2014. Parrot has not yet revealed a price for either device, but CEO Henri Seydoux said that the price for the total package will be higher than the company's original A.R.Drone, which sold for $300.

       " ' Two decades ago, AOL built its business by bundling Internet access with web-browsing software, an offering now responsible for less than a third of AOL\\'s revenues. But AOL isn\\'t done with subscriptions just yet, announcing Monday a new set of packages called Gathr. Gathr bundles a number of existing subscription products and services, like Pandora One and magazines, and offers them at a discount. Bundles are targeted at various consumer groups: A \"Man Cave\" package, for example, offers subscriptions to Maxim and Car and Driver magazines, as well as a subscription to the ad-free version of Pandora, three one-day video game rentals from Redbox and a $10 gift card to Amazon. Bought separately, the products and services retail for $37; Gathr is offering them for $15 per month. Other packages are targeted at families and those concerned about Internet security. SEE ALSO: Steve Case\\'s Second Life as D.C.\\'s Favorite Businessman Beyond pre-bundled packages, customers can also create their own set of three services for $15/month. Options are rather limited — there are 19 offered in sum, with the greatest representation from magazine publishers. Customers can add a bonus to their packages, like a monthly $10 gift card to iTunes or Amazon. \"We\\'ve always believed in bundling,\" Bud Rosenthal, CEO of AOL\\'s membership and paid services group, said in a phone interview with Mashable Friday. \"It\\'s different in this case. Rather than being [bundling] that\\'s done to you, it\\'s an opportunity to empower customers\" — the empowering part being the option to customize your own bundle. Rosenthal says he is confident Gathr can attract subscription numbers in the six to seven-figure range over time. \"It\\'s not going to happen overnight,\" he acknowledges. The offerings strike me as uninspired and anachronistic: At a time when consumers are demanding the right to buy only a subscription to HBO or ESPN, rather than a full cable package, why would AOL try to bundle and sell a bunch of nonessential services? To be fair to AOL, this is only the start, and the company is likely to add more partners, and perhaps more essential services, over time. If it were to offer a broader array of subscription services — personally, I\\'d sign on for one that bundled Spotify, Netflix and the magazines I already subscribe to — it could prove seriously appealing. But therein lies the problem: The most desirable subscription services aren\\'t the most likely to offer them at a discount. Image: Justin Sullivan/Staff/Getty Images ',\n",

All that bureaucratese. No wonder we all procrastinate. But at least it\\'s not the early \\'90s. Back then, when personal computers were new, software designers and the IRS alike were experimenting with ways to use computers to replace mailed-in tax forms. The results were, as so much software was back then ... clunky. And text-based. And oddly fluorescent. Those early tax prep programs replicated analog tax documents in digital form; their main value-add, besides offering their users a whiff of The Future, was that they did your tax calculations for you.  But that didn\\'t stop them from proliferating. As early as 1991 — the same year that AOL for DOS was introduced — there were no less than 15 options for computerized tax preparation. There was J.K.

       " ' Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft and eBay are among more than 200 companies that filed a brief Wednesday calling on the Supreme Court to overturn a provision in a federal law that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The companies filed the document, known as an amicus curiae or \"friend of the court\" brief, in the case against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). They say the law\\'s definition of marriage forces national companies to discriminate against employees based on their marriage status, sexual orientation and state of residence. Differences between DOMA and state laws require discriminating against LGBT employees when it comes to health insurance and other benefits, argues the companies\\' brief. That discrimination, it continues, violates legal requirements and the companies\\' own policies.  The brief also argues DOMA reduces workplace transparency, hurts the employee-employer relationship and adds unnecessary financial burden on companies as they navigate the conflicts between DOMA and various state laws. Facebook first announced the brief in a post on its recently opened LGBTQ@Facebook page. The full brief can be accessed at Bingham.  SEE ALSO: Facebook Adds Same-Sex Marriage Icons for Couples  Many of the same companies are reportedly planning on filing a separate amicus brief in support of striking down California\\'s Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage.  The companies involved in that brief will argue Prop 8 sends \"an unmistakeable signal that same-sex couples are in some way inferior to opposite-sex couples, a proposition that is anathema to amici\\'s commitment to equality and fair treatment to all,\" according to CNN. Meg Whitman, current CEO of Hewlitt-Packard and former eBay CEO and California gubernatorial candidate, recently reversed her personal position on Prop 8 in a blog post. \"I have come to embrace same-sex marriage after a period of careful review and reflection,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"Same-sex couples and their children should have equal access to the benefits of marriage.\" The Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments on Proposition 8  on March 26 and on DOMA one day later.   9 Gay Leaders Making a Difference in Technology        1. Chris Hughes  One of the co-founders of Facebook, Hughes left the company in 2007 to become director of online organizing for Barack Obama\\'s first presidential campaign. In 2010, the entrepreneur founded Juno, a social network aimed at connecting users interested in social good and activism.  Currently, Hughes is the publisher and editor in chief of The New Republic, a progressive political commentary magazine.  Hughes married partner Sean Eldridge, president of investment fund Hudson River Ventures and LGBT equality advocate, in June 2012.   Image courtesy of Facebook, Chris Hughes           2. Peter Sisson  Sisson founded telecommunications company Toktumi in 2008. The company is known for its successful app, Line2, a VoIP service that makes voice calls over Internet protocol addresses rather than relying on telephone companies -- similar to Skype.  According to Big Think, Sisson says being a gay entrepreneur can be challenging, but in his home of San Francisco, it\\'s a \"non-issue.\" \"There\\'s never been any sort of problem with anyone finding out that I was gay and suddenly not wanting to do business with me or not wanting to fund me,\" he said. Image courtesy of Facebook, Peter Sisson           3. Peter Thiel  Best known for co-founding PayPal and working as its CEO, Thiel is also a successful venture capitalist and hedge fund manager. When eBay acquired PayPal in 2002, Thiel\\'s stake was estimated around $55 million.  He also made the first outside investment in Facebook in 2004, securing a 10.2% stake for $500,000. As an openly gay advocate of LGBT causes, Thiel has contributed to the American Foundation for Equal Rights and GOProud.  Image courtesy of Flickr, TechCrunch50-2008           4. Megan Smith  Smith is the VP of business development at Google. She has been with the company over 15 years, starting when PlanetOut partnered with Google in 1998. Smith acted as CEO at PlanetOut, an entertainment and media company targeting the LGBT community.  Smith and her wife, journalist Kara Swisher, have two young sons, Louie and Alex.  Image courtesy of Flickr, Joi           5. Dana Contreras  Contreras started working at Twitter two and a half years ago. She quickly climbed the company ladder to become a senior systems engineer. As a transgender woman, Contreras finds Twitter as welcoming and supportive a workplace as they come.  Contreras married her wife Melissa five years ago, before she gender-transitioned. Image courtesy of Twitter, Dana Contreras           6. Tom Coates  Hailed as one of the earliest webloggers on the Internet, Coates operated award-winning new media blog plastigbag.org until mid-2011, around the time he resigned from Yahoo. He also organized London\\'s Hack Day in 2007, and advises several startups, including Lanyrd. Image courtesy of Flickr, Joi           7. Joel Simkhai  In 2009, Simkhai (left) founded Grindr, arguably the most popular dating and social network for gay and bisexual men. The company boasts over 4 million users in 192 countries.  Initially, Simkhai faced self-doubt as a gay man in business. \"One of my problems was I thought I couldn\\'t be as successful,\" Simkhai told Inc. \"That\\'s partially because I didn\\'t have any gay role models who were very successful and in high-profile jobs.\" Image courtesy of Facebook, Joel Simkhai           8. Jason Goldberg  Founder and CEO of Fab.com, Goldberg initially launched the property as a social network for gay people before transitioning the company to a design inspiration and ecommerce site.  Goldberg and business partner Brian Ellner also launched a site called The Four 2012, which pioneers gay marriage equality through social media efforts.  Goldberg married husband Christian Schoenherr in August 2012 in New York City.   Image courtesy of Facebook, Jason Goldberg           9. Jon Hall  Jon \"Maddog\" Hall is the executive director of Linux International, a non-profit that promotes Linux-based open source software development.  He earned the nickname \"Maddog\" as a professor at Hartford State Technical College, where he also served as computer science department head.  According to Out magazine, Hall was inspired to come out on the 100th anniversary of mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing\\'s birth. “I explained to people who wondered why I came out online that there are a lot of young geeks who are going through the same thing,” he said. “And I wanted to let them know they were not alone, and that it gets better.” Image courtesy of Flickr, campuspartybrasil        Image via iStockphoto, lisafx ',\n",
       " \" Any blog too tiny for a photo budget no longer need fret. Getty Images, the world's largest photo provider, is letting people embed its stock images for free. The move is an abrupt change in business model for the photo service. Instead of relying on licensing fees for its stock photos, it plans to make embed codes public for the majority of collections on site. Those pictures will come without a watermark and will contain an image credit linking to the company's licensing page. But most importantly for Getty, the practice will provide a new form of revenue. See also: Getty Is 'Leaning In' When It Comes to Stock Photos By letting people embed Getty photos, the company can access previously untapped data. Via embeds, Getty can gather user information and run ads within branded, embeddable frames, similar to YouTube's options. In a way, Getty parallels challenges faced by the music industry. For instance, if anyone wants to use a Getty image for free, it's not hard to do, just like it's not difficult to illegally download music. You can find Getty photos via Google and screenshot them, sans watermark. By providing an embed code for WordPress, Twitter and more, Getty hopes to incentivize legal photo uploads, in the same way Spotify offers free music streams. This way, Getty also gets to keep control of those photos. If the company removes an image from its collection, the same image will disappear from every site that embedded it. Ultimately, Getty is acknowledging that its content is in high (often illegal) demand. Instead, it's making a strategic choice to monetize photos via more creative means. If the gamble works, the company will have tapped a revenue stream for years to come. \",\n",

       " ' Bose has filed a lawsuit against headphone-maker Beats Eletronics, alleging patent infringements centered around noise-canceling technology. The lawsuit claims that Beats has infringed on five ideas patented by Bose having to do with noise-canceling headphones, in particular the Beats \"Studio\" and \"Studio Wireless\" products. CNBC first reported the lawsuit, which can be found in its entirety at the bottom of this post. See also: With Beats, Apple Has Its Next iPod Bose released a statement to Mashable saying that it does not comment on active litigation but also stressing its investment in new sound technology. \"The filing is comprehensive and explains our position, and as a matter of practice, we don’t comment on ongoing litigation.  We can share that for over 30 years, Bose has made significant investments in the research, development, engineering and design of the proprietary technologies found in our headphones,\" Bose wrote in the statement. \"We are committed to protecting our investment, protecting our customers, and defending the patents we own.\" Bose has been a long-time player in the high-end headphone market, focusing on quality over style. Beats grew as quite the opposite — with flashy, stylized and equally expensive products with a sound that had not been particularly well-received. Despite the sound issues, Beats took less than six years to become the dominant player in the premium headphone industry with 64% of the market. Apple bought Beats in late May for $3 billion, the largest acquisition in the iPhone-maker\\'s history.  The timing of the lawsuit caused some to wonder if Bose had been biding its time until Beats had deeper pockets, like those of Apple.

       " ' Yahoo acquired app maker Lexity on Wednesday, the company\\'s 20th since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo a little more than a year ago. Twenty startups is no small number, especially when you consider that in just 13 months, the 18-year-old company has boosted its acquisition count by nearly a quarter. See also: Marissa Mayer\\'s First Year at Yahoo: Don\\'t Call It a Comeback The majority of these acquisitions have been small — five were purchased for only $16 million together — and were more often for talent than specific products. Generally speaking, Mayer has sought out companies that have built promising, if unsuccessful, consumer-facing mobile apps. In most cases, those apps have been shut down, and their engineering teams put to work on Yahoo\\'s own. For example, the founders of the first startup Mayer acquired, Stamped, were moved to head up Yahoo\\'s mobile engineering office in New York where, multiple sources tell me, they\\'re working on a major revamp of Yahoo Finance, among other products. In a few cases, the acquisitions were for more than talent. The biggest of these, Yahoo\\'s $1.1 billion cash deal for Tumblr, was all about the product: Mayer, impressed by the blogging network\\'s massive, engaged and rapidly growing user base, has decided to operate it as an independent company. Qwiki, a movie-making iPhone app, also continues to run as its own team within Yahoo, as will Lexity. Other acquisitions involved actual technology: Summly, e-mail plugin Ztelic and mobile ad startup Admovate are all being integrated into Yahoo\\'s existing products. Summly\\'s summarization technology has, in fact, already been integrated into Yahoo News. Here\\'s a look back at the 20 startups Mayer has acquired so far during her tenure at Yahoo: The List   1.

What\\'s Next Yahoo still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions — $4.8 billion as of the end of June. The company has built up a solid base of mobile engineering talent to date. We now expect to see Yahoo focus on acquiring products and talent in the ad technology space, like Mayer\\'s 19th acquisition, Admovate, a company that has developed technology for targeted mobile advertising. Such moves would signal to investors that Mayer is serious about reversing Yahoo\\'s continued decline in advertising revenue, and help it develop products to compete with other ad tech firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter. We also wouldn\\'t be surprised to see more investment in video technology companies, particularly given Mayer\\'s interest in both Qwiki (which Yahoo bought) and Hulu (which it didn\\'t). Such moves would also help Yahoo capture some of the money being poured into the rapidly growing online video ad market, which would simultaneously help offset the company\\'s declines in display and search advertising.

       " ' Imagine a place where computer nerds are revered like jocks and rockstars. That was San Francisco this past weekend. A carefully selected group of 100 college students flocked to the Bay Area to powwow with veterans of the famed tech startup scene. The students came for an all-expense paid weekend to compete in the inaugural run of the \"University Hacker Olympics.\"   One of the event\\'s organizers, Ahmed Siddiqui, called it the \"largest university hackathon ever held.\" \"Our whole goal is to get the best technical minds to the Bay Area and connect them with awesome startups and companies,\" Siddiqui told Mashable. Monica Poletti, a 19-year-old sophomore at North Carolina State, was a member of the winning team. Working with mentors from Pinterest, Poletti and five other students — from Brown, Tufts and Ohio State — designed a visually appealing and functional collaborative workspace.  The tool, called \"Project Yarn,\" is intended to help plan trips, parties and other events. Poletti summed up the project as a cross between Google Docs and a virtual bulletin board. It allows multiple users to work on the board in real time. \"I don\\'t know if we expected it to win, but we all really liked what it could do,\" Poletti told Mashable. \"I learned so much out here in just two days; it was incredible.\" Despite the known gender divide in the tech world, the six members of Poletti\\'s team were divided equally by gender. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, women comprised less than a quarter of the country\\'s STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce in 2009.  Poletti said this group had the highest ratio of females to males of any collaborative programming project she has ever worked on.  SEE ALSO: STEM Careers: The Need to Get More Women Involved From the Start  Below is a screenshot of a Project Yarn story board, on which users planned a cross-country motocycle trip.  SignalFire, an organization based in San Francisco, hosted the competition, which was sponsored by tech companies large and small, from Google to Nature Box and many more. Prior to the event, companies brainstormed ideas. When the students arrived, they divided into teams. The companies then pitched their ideas to the student teams who selected which ones they wanted to pursue. \"It\\'s like doing recruiting without resumes,\" Siddiqui said. \"There\\'s a huge problem of getting developers out here in the valley.\" The students went through a rigorous screening process to win the chance to compete. More than 500 students from about 30 colleges and universities signed up for online coding challenges during November.  Drawing from the top performers in the coding challenge, SignalFire reps selected a final pool of 100 hacker olympiads, based on their previous experience and LinkedIn profiles. After about 24 hours of programming by the students and their mentors, a panel of judges selected the top three groups, which then attended a VIP dinner, accompanied by a group of tech CEOs. There, the contest winner was announced. In addition to the networking opportunity, the top three teams also won Amazon Web Services credit packages. SEE ALSO: College Programmers Beat Tech Elite in Hacking Contest  Raj Mukherjee, vice president and general manager of products for GoDaddy, participated in the competition as a judge. He called Project Yarn a \"a cool application with an awesome front end.\"  \"I was frankly blown over by the quality of the students that participated in the hackathon,\" Mukherjee told Mashable. All parties — organizers, sponsors and students — seemed to agree that the University Hacker Olympics was a success. On behalf of SignalFire, Siddiqui said the company hopes to make this a bi-annual tradition, including even more colleges and universities in the future. Stay tuned, hackers. Next time, it could be you who brings home the gold.   Images courtesy of Flickr, Scorpions and Centaurs, and Monica Poletti/Project Yarn ',\n",

       " '  Modular Robotics, a company based \\xa0in Boulder, Co., is about to release robot-building kits that let you construct any kind of android you want, no programming required. The kits, called MOSS, come in three different sizes. The larger ones contain pieces for you to build your robot, which come in various shapes and sizes. All are made of plastic that is molded around several exposed magnets and ball bearings, letting you connect your android building blocks like Legos to construct anything from a car to a robot that fires a Nerf gun. See also: Meet the Robots Reading Your Resume The company is also planning to release an app to control these semi-autonomous creations. Once you download the app, the software would let you direct the robot from your smartphone or tablet. According to its Kickstarter campaign, you\\'ll be able to customize these actions — for example, you can tell your android car to move forward or instruct your robot\\'s head to turn left, all with one or two taps. MOSS doesn\\'t require a knowledge of computer programming, Eric Schweikardt, the CEO and design director at Modular Robotics, told\\xa0Mashable. \"It\\'s trying to give kids education and exposure to these computational components without putting up that barrier.\" Another draw is that they\\'re not limited to elementary school kids. MOSS is intended to be intuitive but also has a high ceiling, Schweikardt added. If the Kickstarter page is any indication, plenty of people are ready to build. The campaign doesn\\'t end until Dec. 10, but Modular Robotics has already nearly tripled its original goal of $100,000. Donors can receive anything from a company t-shirt ($20) to a \"simple\" starter kit ($59) to a tour of the facilities ($5,000). The campaign video promises that anyone who contributes enough cash to get a starter kit will receive it before MOSS is commercially available. \"I\\'m pretty excited to see all the movable and motion-centric robots that people are going to start building,\"\\xa0Schweikardt said. Delivery is expected for February 2014. Image: Modular Robotics ',\n",

Powered by an Intel Bay Trail-T Quad Core processor, the Miix2 can even run older apps made for Windows XP or 7.

The residue on Myers\\' hands could mean he discharged a gun or touched an object with gunshot residue on it. The same goes for the residue on his clothing.  However, St. Louis Police Officers\\' Association business manager Jeff Roorda cited other evidence against Myers during a news conference: Social media photos that Roorda said show Myers holding three guns, one of them a 9 mm Smith & Wesson. Roorda said it is likely the stolen gun Myers used to shoot at the officer. He did not provide copies of the photos. Myers\\' family contends that he was unarmed and that the officer, who was in uniform but who was off-duty and working for a security company at the time, mistook a sandwich Myers was holding for a gun. Myers\\' father, Vonderrit Myers Sr., declined to comment Tuesday. Gerryl Christmas, an attorney for the family, said they want complete investigation, not one conducted in bits and pieces. \"When somebody\\'s son is dead, don\\'t they deserve a full and thorough investigation?\" he said. The shooting set off a new round of intense protests similar to those in Ferguson after Brown\\'s death. Both Brown and Myers were black. Both officers are white. A state grand jury is deciding whether charges will be filed against the Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson. The St. Louis officer has not been named and is on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. The officer was working a moonlighting job as a security officer hired to patrol a neighborhood near the Missouri Botanical Garden in south St. Louis. Though not on duty, he was wearing his police uniform and armed with his department-issued gun, which is common practice in St. Louis. Police Chief Sam Dotson said the officer became suspicious when Myers and the men with him started to run. A chase ensued and the officer and Myers got into a physical confrontation. After Myers pulled away, Dotson said, he went up a hill and started shooting at the officer. Ballistic evidence shows Myers fired three shots before his gun jammed, Dotson said. Police said they recovered the gun, which was reported stolen on Sept. 26. Roorda said the gun in the photo was an exact match for the gun found on Myers after his death. \"This is a distinct-looking gun, not one seen on the streets very often,\" he said. Roorda called political leaders who blamed the police for Myers\\' death \"irresponsible and despicable.\" \"The allegation that the young man had nothing but a sandwich was a silly allegation proven quickly to be untrue,\" he said. The officer fired off 17 rounds. Preliminary autopsy results show Myers was struck six or seven times and died from a wound to the head, according to medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham. Online court documents show that Myers was free on bond when he was killed. He had been charged with the unlawful use of a weapon, a felony, and misdemeanor resisting arrest in June. The officer\\'s attorney, Brian Millikan, said the shooting was \"a traumatic event in his life.\" He said the officer is undergoing counseling. Additional reporting by Mashable ',\n",
       " \" Starting in June, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will spend his days at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco taking pictures with visiting tourists.  At least, that's what the wax version of Zuckerberg will be doing.  See also: Facebook's News Feed: What Changed and Why Madame Tussauds, the world famous London-based wax museum, unveiled a life-size wax figure of Zuckerberg on Wednesday as part of a promotion for the museum's grand opening in San Francisco in June. The figure was unveiled alongside two other celebrity figures: actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and recording artist Rihanna.  Zuckerberg, shown barefoot and sitting lotus with a laptop, joins a handful of tech luminaries immortalized by Madame Tussauds in years past. His predecessors include Apple cofounder Steve Jobs and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates.  The Facebook founder won't be the only tech figure at the museum, says Lauren Fahrer, marketing manager for Madame Tussauds San Francisco, but there's a good chance he'll be the most famous.   The Zuckerberg figure was unveiled alongside other celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna. Image: Kurt Wagner/MashableThe figure, which took 20 artists between 3 and 4 months to create, is a life-size replica down to the last freckle, says Fahrer. The figure's hair is real, took two weeks to complete and was inserted by hand, one strand at a time. Typically, the artists ask their subjects to do a sitting where more than 200 measurements are made to ensure accuracy. In Zuckerberg's case, the CEO was unavailable for a sitting — so artists had to construct the figure using only photos.  The figure features Zuckerberg in his signature hoody and jeans, complete with a Facebook shirt donated by the company, says Fahrer. (The shirt isn't visible in these photos due to copyright issues.)  The museum opens on June 26 and should have more celebrities, politicians, and tech luminaries included, says Fahrer. For now, three's a party — and in a tech town like San Francisco, Zuckerberg is the hottest attraction.  \",\n",

This year's games in Sochi disprove any notion that the Winter Olympics lacks the pomp of the Summer Olympics. Medal counts aside, each successive host city works to make its games bigger, its torch relays longer and its total cost greater than the games before. Well, maybe not the latter so much, but Sochi's estimated $51 billion price tag sure makes it seem that way.

       " ' UPDATE: 1:04 p.m. ET - Israeli officials said the country has accepted Egypt\\'s Gaza cease-fire proposal, clearing the way for new talks. CAIRO — Palestinian negotiators on Sunday said they had accepted an Egyptian proposal for a new 72-hour truce with Israel, clearing the way for a possible resumption of talks on a long-term cease-fire arrangement in the Gaza Strip. Israel had walked away from cease-fire talks over the weekend, after militants resumed their rocket fire on southern Israel with the expiration of an earlier three-day truce. Sunday\\'s decision was aimed at bringing the Israelis back to the negotiations. There was no immediate Israeli response. See also: Inside the \\'Terror Tunnels\\' in Gaza \"We are here to look for an agreement. We cannot have an agreement without talks, so we accepted an Egyptian proposal to have a cease-fire for 72 hours in order to resume the talks,\" said a Palestinian negotiator. He, along with other Palestinian negotiators who confirmed the decision, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Later on Sunday, Egypt called on Israel and Palestinian factions later to observe a 72-hour cease-fire beginning within hours, and to resume talks on a more comprehensive Gaza agreement. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the announcement would not have been made if the cease-fire agreement was not secured, indicating that Israel had also accepted the proposal. The statement said the cease-fire would begin at midnight, Cairo time, and would create the atmosphere to resume humanitarian aid as well as indirect talks, through Egypt, to reach a more lasting and comprehensive cease-fire. The Egyptian-mediated talks are aimed at brokering a long-term truce arrangement between Israel and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, following the heaviest fighting between the bitter enemies since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. In nearly a month of fighting, more than 1,900 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians, nearly 10,000 were wounded and thousands of homes destroyed. Sixty-seven people were killed on the Israeli side, including three civilians. The fighting ended in a temporary 72-hour cease-fire last Tuesday, during which Egypt had hoped to mediate a longer-term agreement. But when the three-day window expired, militants resumed their rocket fire, sparking new Israeli reprisals. The violence has continued throughout the weekend, albeit not as strong as at the height of the fighting. Earlier Sunday, Palestinians threatened to quit the negotiations if Israel did not return, while Israeli leaders said there would be no talks while the rocket fire continues. \"Israel will not negotiate under fire,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday, warning his country\\'s military campaign \"will take time.\" Hamas is seeking an end to an Israeli-Egypt blockade that has decimated the local economy. Israel said the blockade is needed to prevent arms smuggling, and that Hamas must disarm as part of any long-term arrangement. Hamas has said handing over its weapons arsenal, which is believed to include several thousand remaining rockets, is inconceivable. There has been discussion of war-crimes investigations into actions by both Israel and Hamas. Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said last week that Israel should be held accountable for possible war crimes in Gaza, and also criticized Hamas for allegedly launching rockets from civilian-heavy areas.

       " ' Many details about the Aaron Swartz case still remain shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Last week, though, we learned that the prosecutors of his case were targeting him for his open-access activism. New details have now emerged about his life during the months following his arrest for allegedly downloading thousands of scholarly articles from the online database JSTOR.  In a long and at times harrowing essay published in The Atlantic, journalist Quinn Norton recounts what happend to her life with Swartz after his arrest, revealing that the government subpoenaed her for information about the case. Norton, a freelance writer and Wired contributor, was Swartz\\'s partner at the time.  Perhaps the biggest revelation coming out of Norton\\'s account is that the prosecutors didn\\'t know of Swartz\\'s \"Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto\" until Norton herself told them about it by mistake. During a meeting with the case\\'s prosecutor, Steve Heymann, Norton mentioned the manifesto when asked if she had any idea why Swartz would do what he did. She assumed the prosecutor already knew about it, since it was easily accessible through a simple Google search. \"So this is where I was profoundly foolish. I told them about the Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto. And in doing so, Aaron would explain to me later (and reporters would confirm), I made everything worse. This is what I must live with,\" she wrote.  The essay, which is definitely a must-read for anybody who has followed the case and the news after Swartz commited suicide in his Brooklyn apartment on Jan. 11, reveals details about something that normally stays tightly under wraps: a federal criminal investigation. After a crime is committed and before an actual indictment is issued, prosecutors convene a grand jury to assess whether there\\'s a basis for a prosecution. During that process, the prosecution has the right to subpoena potential witnesses and ask for evidence. Norton was one of those questioned by the government. The months that followed Swartz\\'s arrest became a nightmare for both him and Norton. \"Once your life is inside a federal investigation, there is no space outside of it. The only private thing is your thoughts, and even they don\\'t feel safe anymore,\" wrote Norton. \"Every word you speak or write can be used, manipulated, or played like a card against your future and the future of those you love. There are no neutral parties, no sources of unimpeachable wisdom and trust.\" SEE ALSO: White House Directive Expands Access to Scientific Research Norton also reveals that Swartz was indeed offered a plea deal that would have only entailed \"three months in prison, three months in some sort of halfway house, and three months of probation, and a felony count.\" Swartz asked Norton to decide for him if he should take it. Though he may not have taken the deal because, in the last years of his life, Swartz began thinking about working in politics, a profession in which having a felony on your record is frowned upon.  Norton told him to fight and now she regrets it. \"I\\'ve spent many nights this year, awake, wishing I\\'d been a little more selfish that day,\" she wrote. According to her, the government unjustly persecuted Swartz, and used her against him.  \"The prosecutors manipulated me and used my love against Aaron without me understanding what they were doing,\" Norton wrote. \"This is their normal. They would do this to anyone. We should understand that any alleged crime can become life-ruining if it catches their eyes. Innocence and goodness are only factored in as risks to their case. This is the system that we, as citizens, have agreed to.\"  Read Norton\\'s full account here.  Image courtesy of Flickr, Quinn Norton ',\n",

Tongue-in-cheek article get published about a guy\\'s style Trade magazine B&T published an interview titled “Industry Fashionista” in which Jarryd Zankovic said some questionable things about himself. By all accounts, he seemed to be having a laugh. \"I\\'m a funny hybrid between beauty therapist and tradie,\" Zankovic said. \"I come from a family of beauticians and they\\'ve been waxing my eyebrows from the age of 12 to make sure I have two eyebrows and not one. So you can imagine my hair and my beard follows a similar regimen. I get my beard trimmed on a weekly basis. Wow. That sounds so much worse than it actually is.\" Zankovic is then pictured in the magazine in a power stance with his full beard, pocket handkerchief and drop crotch.  Jarryd Zankovic.He continued: \"I get called a hipster, but I f*cking hate that description. But you know... beard, no socks, drop crotch – which is really comfortable, especially for a dude who has a bit going on between this legs.\" Reddit user posts the article, calling fashionista a \\'wanker\\' This is when things got bad. A guy known only as \\'andrewinmelbourne\\' posted a photo of the article to reddit with the headline: \"I think this guy just won \\'Australia\\'s Biggest Wanker\\'\". Commenters jumped on board the sledging match, taking aim at Jarryd\\'s style, hipsterism and overall attitude — with one even claiming \"he doesn\\'t deserve his beard\". \"I don\\'t know how to put this...I\\'m kind of a big deal. My apartment smells of rich mahogany.

Some took aim at the unique spelling of his name: \"He even has a douchey spelling of Jared\". Ouch. His employer PLAY Communications said Jarryd is not the guy the Internet described “We were surprised by the tone of the article — it certainly doesn’t reflect Jarryd’s nature at all — he’s a great guy who’s both talented and grounded. \"Although he’s always well-groomed, more than anything he was having a laugh at himself and general stereotypes — some things have been taken out of context,” a representative told Fairfax Media. B&T tells everyone to calm down, this guy is not a \\'wanker\\' B&T put out a new article, with Editor-in-Chief David Hovenden declaring: \\'This is NOT Australia\\'s biggest wanker\\', and starting a hashtag #TeamJarryd in support of the ad exec. \"When a young man who’s at the top of his game is flamed by such a bunch of jealous bastards, it is truly an indictment on society,\" Hovenden said. \"Despite what the faceless haters say Zankovic is not a wanker, but someone with a great sense of humour, a sense of styles and trends, a sense of himself and a great sense of purpose,\" he wrote. \"The entire piece, like most of what you read in B&T was a celebration of individuality and fun.\" B&T decides it enjoys the trolling, throws fuel on fire Unfortunately, like all considered responses to trolls on the Internet, #TeamJarryd got taken down on social media.

       " \" The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Askem The Pitch: Askem aims to simplify your decision-making process.  Why It's Taking Off: Askem lets you share your questions online and create up to five different text responses to choose from, so you can cut through the digital noise and get the answers you need instantly. If you post pictures of three different outfits on Facebook or Twitter and ask which one you should wear tonight, chances are you’ll get a bunch of “likes” and comments and countless opinions, but no definitive answer.  That’s why there’s Askem, an iPhone app that encourages its users to unleash their curiosity and “question everything.” The Israeli-based startup created the app as a solution to the digital noise on social media, and the thousands of questions that users ask every day.  “People are always asking questions on social networks, but they don’t get the bottom line, meaningful answers they’re looking for,” Itai Herman, CEO and co-founder of askem, told Mashable in an interview. “Those questions get comments, likes and wall posts, but no conclusions.”  Similar to other decision-making apps such as Seesaw and Polar, Askem users start by uploading a photo and asking any question they want an answer to or feedback on. However, whereas Seesaw and Polar lets you vote on photos, Askem users can create up to five text responses that people can vote on, and place them anywhere on the photo. Users then share their visual questions to Facebook or Twitter to get the answers they need directly. Anyone, not only askem users, can respond to your question by clicking on one of the text choices, or leaving a comment. The app displays the percentage of responses for each answer, and also breaks those percentages down into four categories so you can know what the world, just your friends, men, or women think. The app also has a live news feed where users can follow other users or topics of interests via hashtags.  “It was important to us to create a platform that allows users to ask anything creatively that comes to mind, not just a yes or no question,” Itai said. “Askem is much more than a decision-making tool – it unleashes curiosity and lets users know what the world thinks almost instantly.”  Askem is a graduate of Microsoft’s Israeli Windows Azure 2013 accelerator program, a four-month program that provides startups with the mentors, training, and tools they need to develop their startup. As part of the program, the participants travel to the U.S. to market their startup and seek investors. So far, Askem has raised a total of $560,000 in funding. The app uses a profiling technology to measure and analyze how users engage with the app. This profile can help brands better understand their customers’ behaviors and interests.  Although the startup does not have a business model in place yet, they plan to provide in-depth analytics to users or brands that would create a meaningful relationship and new level of engagement between brands and consumers.
